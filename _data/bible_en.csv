1	1	1	1	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
2	1	1	2	1	2	Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
3	1	1	3	1	3	And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
4	1	1	4	1	4	And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
5	1	1	5	1	5	God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
6	1	1	6	1	6	And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.”
7	1	1	7	1	7	So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so.
8	1	1	8	1	8	God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
9	1	1	9	1	9	And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so.
10	1	1	10	1	10	God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
11	1	1	11	1	11	Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so.
12	1	1	12	1	12	The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
13	1	1	13	1	13	And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
14	1	1	14	1	14	And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years.
15	1	1	15	1	15	And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
16	1	1	16	1	16	God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He made the stars as well.
17	1	1	17	1	17	God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth,
18	1	1	18	1	18	to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
19	1	1	19	1	19	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
20	1	1	20	1	20	And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”
21	1	1	21	1	21	So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every bird of flight after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
22	1	1	22	1	22	Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
23	1	1	23	1	23	And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
24	1	1	24	1	24	And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
25	1	1	25	1	25	God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
26	1	1	26	1	26	Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature that crawls upon it.”
27	1	1	27	1	27	So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
28	1	1	28	1	28	God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.”
29	1	1	29	1	29	Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food.
30	1	1	30	1	30	And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
31	1	1	31	1	31	And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
32	1	2	1	2	1	Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
33	1	2	2	2	2	And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work.
34	1	2	3	2	3	Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished.
35	1	2	4	2	4	This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.
36	1	2	5	2	5	Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
37	1	2	6	2	6	But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
38	1	2	7	2	7	Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.
39	1	2	8	2	8	And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed.
40	1	2	9	2	9	Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
41	1	2	10	2	10	Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:
42	1	2	11	2	11	The name of the first river is Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
43	1	2	12	2	12	And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.
44	1	2	13	2	13	The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.
45	1	2	14	2	14	The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
46	1	2	15	2	15	Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
47	1	2	16	2	16	And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,
48	1	2	17	2	17	but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
49	1	2	18	2	18	The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”
50	1	2	19	2	19	And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
51	1	2	20	2	20	The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
52	1	2	21	2	21	So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the area with flesh.
53	1	2	22	2	22	And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him.
54	1	2	23	2	23	And the man said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for out of man she was taken.”
55	1	2	24	2	24	For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
56	1	2	25	2	25	And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
57	1	3	1	3	1	Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden?’”
58	1	3	2	3	2	The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden,
59	1	3	3	3	3	but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’”
60	1	3	4	3	4	“You will not surely die,” the serpent told her.
61	1	3	5	3	5	“For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
62	1	3	6	3	6	When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
63	1	3	7	3	7	And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.
64	1	3	8	3	8	Then the man and his wife heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
65	1	3	9	3	9	So the LORD God called out to the man, “Where are you?”
66	1	3	10	3	10	“I heard Your voice in the garden,” he replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
67	1	3	11	3	11	“Who told you that you were naked?” asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
68	1	3	12	3	12	And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
69	1	3	13	3	13	Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.”
70	1	3	14	3	14	So the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field! On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life.
71	1	3	15	3	15	And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”
72	1	3	16	3	16	To the woman He said: “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”
73	1	3	17	3	17	And to Adam He said: “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
74	1	3	18	3	18	Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
75	1	3	19	3	19	By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread, until you return to the ground—because out of it were you taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.”
76	1	3	20	3	20	And Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to be the mother of all the living.
77	1	3	21	3	21	And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.
78	1	3	22	3	22	Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
79	1	3	23	3	23	Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
80	1	3	24	3	24	So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life.
81	1	4	1	4	1	And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said.
82	1	4	2	4	2	Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.
83	1	4	3	4	3	So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,
84	1	4	4	4	4	while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
85	1	4	5	4	5	but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.
86	1	4	6	4	6	“Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen?
87	1	4	7	4	7	If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.”
88	1	4	8	4	8	Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
89	1	4	9	4	9	And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
90	1	4	10	4	10	“What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
91	1	4	11	4	11	Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
92	1	4	12	4	12	When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
93	1	4	13	4	13	But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.
94	1	4	14	4	14	Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
95	1	4	15	4	15	“Not so!” replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.
96	1	4	16	4	16	So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
97	1	4	17	4	17	And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.
98	1	4	18	4	18	Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech.
99	1	4	19	4	19	And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
100	1	4	20	4	20	And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock.
101	1	4	21	4	21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
102	1	4	22	4	22	Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
103	1	4	23	4	23	Then Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
104	1	4	24	4	24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
105	1	4	25	4	25	And Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”
106	1	4	26	4	26	And to Seth also a son was born, and he called him Enosh. At that time men began to invoke the name of the LORD.
107	1	5	1	5	1	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in His own likeness.
108	1	5	2	5	2	Male and female He created them, and He blessed them. And in the day they were created, He called them “man.”
109	1	5	3	5	3	When Adam was 130 years old, he had a son in his own likeness, after his own image; and he named him Seth.
110	1	5	4	5	4	And after he had become the father of Seth, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
111	1	5	5	5	5	So Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
112	1	5	6	5	6	When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of Enosh.
113	1	5	7	5	7	And after he had become the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
114	1	5	8	5	8	So Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.
115	1	5	9	5	9	When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan.
116	1	5	10	5	10	And after he had become the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
117	1	5	11	5	11	So Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.
118	1	5	12	5	12	When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalaleel.
119	1	5	13	5	13	And after he had become the father of Mahalaleel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
120	1	5	14	5	14	So Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.
121	1	5	15	5	15	When Mahalaleel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared.
122	1	5	16	5	16	And after he had become the father of Jared, Mahalaleel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
123	1	5	17	5	17	So Mahalaleel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.
124	1	5	18	5	18	When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch.
125	1	5	19	5	19	And after he had become the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
126	1	5	20	5	20	So Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
127	1	5	21	5	21	When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah.
128	1	5	22	5	22	And after he had become the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
129	1	5	23	5	23	So Enoch lived a total of 365 years.
130	1	5	24	5	24	Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God had taken him away.
131	1	5	25	5	25	When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech.
132	1	5	26	5	26	And after he had become the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
133	1	5	27	5	27	So Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.
134	1	5	28	5	28	When Lamech was 182 years old, he had a son.
135	1	5	29	5	29	And he named him Noah, saying, “May this one comfort us in the labor and toil of our hands caused by the ground that the LORD has cursed.”
136	1	5	30	5	30	And after he had become the father of Noah, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
137	1	5	31	5	31	So Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.
138	1	5	32	5	32	After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
139	1	6	1	6	1	Now when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them,
140	1	6	2	6	2	the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives whomever they chose.
141	1	6	3	6	3	So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years.”
142	1	6	4	6	4	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and afterward as well, when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown.
143	1	6	5	6	5	Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time.
144	1	6	6	6	6	And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
145	1	6	7	6	7	So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.”
146	1	6	8	6	8	Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
147	1	6	9	6	9	This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
148	1	6	10	6	10	And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
149	1	6	11	6	11	Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and full of violence.
150	1	6	12	6	12	And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt; for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted their ways.
151	1	6	13	6	13	Then God said to Noah, “The end of all living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth.
152	1	6	14	6	14	Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out.
153	1	6	15	6	15	And this is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.
154	1	6	16	6	16	You are to make a roof for the ark, finish its walls a cubit from the top, place a door in the side of the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.
155	1	6	17	6	17	And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish.
156	1	6	18	6	18	But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
157	1	6	19	6	19	And you are to bring two of every living thing into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with you.
158	1	6	20	6	20	Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive.
159	1	6	21	6	21	You are also to take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and for the animals.”
160	1	6	22	6	22	So Noah did everything precisely as God had commanded him.
161	1	7	1	7	1	Then the LORD said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.
162	1	7	2	7	2	You are to take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate; a pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate;
163	1	7	3	7	3	and seven pairs of every kind of bird of the air, male and female, to preserve their offspring on the face of all the earth.
164	1	7	4	7	4	For seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living thing I have made.”
165	1	7	5	7	5	And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
166	1	7	6	7	6	Now Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth.
167	1	7	7	7	7	And Noah entered the ark, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives, to escape the waters of the flood.
168	1	7	8	7	8	The clean and unclean animals, the birds, and everything that crawls along the ground
169	1	7	9	7	9	came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
170	1	7	10	7	10	And after seven days the floodwaters came upon the earth.
171	1	7	11	7	11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
172	1	7	12	7	12	And the rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.
173	1	7	13	7	13	On that very day Noah entered the ark, along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and his wife, and the three wives of his sons—
174	1	7	14	7	14	they and every kind of wild animal, livestock, crawling creature, bird, and winged creature.
175	1	7	15	7	15	They came to Noah to enter the ark, two by two of every creature with the breath of life.
176	1	7	16	7	16	And they entered, the male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
177	1	7	17	7	17	For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and the waters rose and lifted the ark high above the earth.
178	1	7	18	7	18	So the waters continued to surge and rise greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters.
179	1	7	19	7	19	Finally, the waters completely inundated the earth, so that all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered.
180	1	7	20	7	20	The waters rose and covered the mountaintops to a depth of fifteen cubits.
181	1	7	21	7	21	And every creature that had moved upon the earth perished—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind.
182	1	7	22	7	22	Of all that had been on dry land, everything that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
183	1	7	23	7	23	And every living thing on the face of the earth was destroyed—man and livestock, crawling creatures and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah remained, and those with him in the ark.
184	1	7	24	7	24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth for 150 days.
185	1	8	1	8	1	But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. And He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to subside.
186	1	8	2	8	2	The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
187	1	8	3	8	3	The waters receded steadily from the earth, and after 150 days the waters had gone down.
188	1	8	4	8	4	On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
189	1	8	5	8	5	And the waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
190	1	8	6	8	6	After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
191	1	8	7	8	7	and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
192	1	8	8	8	8	Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.
193	1	8	9	8	9	But the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, because water still covered the surface of all the earth. So he reached out his hand and brought her back inside the ark.
194	1	8	10	8	10	Noah waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
195	1	8	11	8	11	And behold, the dove returned to him in the evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.
196	1	8	12	8	12	And Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him.
197	1	8	13	8	13	In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the water had dried up from the earth. So Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
198	1	8	14	8	14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was fully dry.
199	1	8	15	8	15	Then God said to Noah,
200	1	8	16	8	16	“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, along with your sons and their wives.
201	1	8	17	8	17	Bring out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock, and everything that crawls upon the ground—so that they can spread out over the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon it.”
202	1	8	18	8	18	So Noah came out, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
203	1	8	19	8	19	Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves upon the earth—came out of the ark, kind by kind.
204	1	8	20	8	20	Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. And taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar.
205	1	8	21	8	21	When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.
206	1	8	22	8	22	As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall never cease.”
207	1	9	1	9	1	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
208	1	9	2	9	2	The fear and dread of you will fall on every living creature on the earth, every bird of the air, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are delivered into your hand.
209	1	9	3	9	3	Everything that lives and moves will be food for you; just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you all things.
210	1	9	4	9	4	But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it.
211	1	9	5	9	5	And surely I will require the life of any man or beast by whose hand your lifeblood is shed. I will demand an accounting from anyone who takes the life of his fellow man:
212	1	9	6	9	6	Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man his blood will be shed; for in His own image God has made mankind.
213	1	9	7	9	7	But as for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out across the earth and multiply upon it.”
214	1	9	8	9	8	Then God said to Noah and his sons with him,
215	1	9	9	9	9	“Behold, I now establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you,
216	1	9	10	9	10	and with every living creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth—every living thing that came out of the ark.
217	1	9	11	9	11	And I establish My covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
218	1	9	12	9	12	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come:
219	1	9	13	9	13	I have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
220	1	9	14	9	14	Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
221	1	9	15	9	15	I will remember My covenant between Me and you and all living creatures: Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
222	1	9	16	9	16	And whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of every kind that is on the earth.”
223	1	9	17	9	17	So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all living things on the earth.”
224	1	9	18	9	18	The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.
225	1	9	19	9	19	These three were the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.
226	1	9	20	9	20	Now Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.
227	1	9	21	9	21	But when he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent.
228	1	9	22	9	22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside.
229	1	9	23	9	23	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and placed it across their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.
230	1	9	24	9	24	When Noah awoke from his drunkenness and learned what his youngest son had done to him,
231	1	9	25	9	25	he said, “Cursed be Canaan! A servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.”
232	1	9	26	9	26	He also declared: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the servant of Shem.
233	1	9	27	9	27	May God expand the territory of Japheth; may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his servant.”
234	1	9	28	9	28	After the flood, Noah lived 350 years.
235	1	9	29	9	29	So Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
236	1	10	1	10	1	This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood.
237	1	10	2	10	2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
238	1	10	3	10	3	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
239	1	10	4	10	4	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites.
240	1	10	5	10	5	From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations.
241	1	10	6	10	6	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
242	1	10	7	10	7	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
243	1	10	8	10	8	And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth.
244	1	10	9	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”
245	1	10	10	10	10	His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
246	1	10	11	10	11	From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
247	1	10	12	10	12	and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.
248	1	10	13	10	13	And Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,
249	1	10	14	10	14	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites.
250	1	10	15	10	15	Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
251	1	10	16	10	16	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
252	1	10	17	10	17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
253	1	10	18	10	18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered,
254	1	10	19	10	19	and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
255	1	10	20	10	20	These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
256	1	10	21	10	21	And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber.
257	1	10	22	10	22	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
258	1	10	23	10	23	The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
259	1	10	24	10	24	And Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber.
260	1	10	25	10	25	And two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.
261	1	10	26	10	26	And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
262	1	10	27	10	27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
263	1	10	28	10	28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
264	1	10	29	10	29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
265	1	10	30	10	30	Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
266	1	10	31	10	31	These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.
267	1	10	32	10	32	All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
268	1	11	1	11	1	Now the whole world had one language and a common form of speech.
269	1	11	2	11	2	And as people journeyed eastward, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
270	1	11	3	11	3	And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” So they used brick instead of stone, and tar instead of mortar.
271	1	11	4	11	4	“Come,” they said, “let us build for ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of all the earth.”
272	1	11	5	11	5	Then the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building.
273	1	11	6	11	6	And the LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people speaking the same language, then nothing they devise will be beyond them.
274	1	11	7	11	7	Come, let Us go down and confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”
275	1	11	8	11	8	So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
276	1	11	9	11	9	That is why it is called Babel, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world, and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth.
277	1	11	10	11	10	This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
278	1	11	11	11	11	And after he had become the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
279	1	11	12	11	12	When Arphaxad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah.
280	1	11	13	11	13	And after he had become the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
281	1	11	14	11	14	When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber.
282	1	11	15	11	15	And after he had become the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
283	1	11	16	11	16	When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg.
284	1	11	17	11	17	And after he had become the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
285	1	11	18	11	18	When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu.
286	1	11	19	11	19	And after he had become the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
287	1	11	20	11	20	When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug.
288	1	11	21	11	21	And after he had become the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
289	1	11	22	11	22	When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor.
290	1	11	23	11	23	And after he had become the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
291	1	11	24	11	24	When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah.
292	1	11	25	11	25	And after he had become the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
293	1	11	26	11	26	When Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
294	1	11	27	11	27	This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
295	1	11	28	11	28	During his father Terah’s lifetime, Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
296	1	11	29	11	29	And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. Abram’s wife was named Sarai, and Nahor’s wife was named Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
297	1	11	30	11	30	But Sarai was barren; she had no children.
298	1	11	31	11	31	And Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai the wife of Abram, and they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans for the land of Canaan. But when they arrived in Haran, they settled there.
299	1	11	32	11	32	Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
300	1	12	1	12	1	Then the LORD said to Abram, “Leave your country, your kindred, and your father’s household, and go to the land I will show you.
301	1	12	2	12	2	I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
302	1	12	3	12	3	I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you; and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”
303	1	12	4	12	4	So Abram departed, as the LORD had directed him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
304	1	12	5	12	5	And Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all the possessions and people they had acquired in Haran, and set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
305	1	12	6	12	6	Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the Oak of Moreh at Shechem. And at that time the Canaanites were in the land.
306	1	12	7	12	7	Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” So Abram built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
307	1	12	8	12	8	From there Abram moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built an altar to the LORD, and he called on the name of the LORD.
308	1	12	9	12	9	And Abram journeyed on toward the Negev.
309	1	12	10	12	10	Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
310	1	12	11	12	11	As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman,
311	1	12	12	12	12	and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live.
312	1	12	13	12	13	Please say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake, and on account of you my life will be spared.”
313	1	12	14	12	14	So when Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
314	1	12	15	12	15	When Pharaoh’s officials saw Sarai, they commended her to him, and she was taken into the palace of Pharaoh.
315	1	12	16	12	16	He treated Abram well on her account, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.
316	1	12	17	12	17	The LORD, however, afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
317	1	12	18	12	18	So Pharaoh summoned Abram and asked, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?
318	1	12	19	12	19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”
319	1	12	20	12	20	Then Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning Abram, and they sent him away with his wife and all his possessions.
320	1	13	1	13	1	So Abram went up out of Egypt into the Negev—he and his wife and all his possessions—and Lot was with him.
321	1	13	2	13	2	And Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver and gold.
322	1	13	3	13	3	From the Negev he journeyed from place to place toward Bethel, until he came to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been pitched,
323	1	13	4	13	4	to the site where he had built the altar. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
324	1	13	5	13	5	Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
325	1	13	6	13	6	But the land was unable to support both of them while they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they were unable to coexist.
326	1	13	7	13	7	And there was discord between the herdsmen of Abram and the herdsmen of Lot. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.
327	1	13	8	13	8	So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no contention between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen. After all, we are brothers.
328	1	13	9	13	9	Is not the whole land before you? Now separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.”
329	1	13	10	13	10	And Lot looked out and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan, all the way to Zoar, was well watered like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
330	1	13	11	13	11	So Lot chose the whole plain of the Jordan for himself and set out toward the east. And Abram and Lot parted company.
331	1	13	12	13	12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot settled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
332	1	13	13	13	13	But the men of Sodom were wicked, sinning greatly against the LORD.
333	1	13	14	13	14	After Lot had departed, the LORD said to Abram, “Now lift up your eyes from the place where you are, and look to the north and south and east and west,
334	1	13	15	13	15	for all the land that you see, I will give to you and your offspring forever.
335	1	13	16	13	16	I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your offspring could be counted.
336	1	13	17	13	17	Get up and walk around the land, through its length and width—for I will give it to you.”
337	1	13	18	13	18	So Abram moved his tent and went to live near the oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.
338	1	14	1	14	1	In those days Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim
339	1	14	2	14	2	went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
340	1	14	3	14	3	The latter five came as allies to the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
341	1	14	4	14	4	For twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
342	1	14	5	14	5	In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
343	1	14	6	14	6	and the Horites in the area of Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is near the desert.
344	1	14	7	14	7	Then they turned back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
345	1	14	8	14	8	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and arrayed for battle in the Valley of Siddim
346	1	14	9	14	9	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
347	1	14	10	14	10	Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some men fell into the pits, but the survivors fled to the hill country.
348	1	14	11	14	11	The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food, and they went on their way.
349	1	14	12	14	12	They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
350	1	14	13	14	13	Then an escapee came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were bound by treaty to Abram.
351	1	14	14	14	14	And when Abram heard that his relative had been captured, he mobilized the 318 trained men born in his household, and they set out in pursuit as far as Dan.
352	1	14	15	14	15	During the night, Abram divided his forces and routed Chedorlaomer’s army, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
353	1	14	16	14	16	He retrieved all the goods, as well as his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the rest of the people.
354	1	14	17	14	17	After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
355	1	14	18	14	18	Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine—since he was priest of God Most High—
356	1	14	19	14	19	and he blessed Abram and said: “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
357	1	14	20	14	20	and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.
358	1	14	21	14	21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself.”
359	1	14	22	14	22	But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the LORD God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
360	1	14	23	14	23	that I will not accept even a thread, or a strap of a sandal, or anything that belongs to you, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’
361	1	14	24	14	24	I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share for the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. They may take their portion.”
362	1	15	1	15	1	After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”
363	1	15	2	15	2	But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
364	1	15	3	15	3	Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
365	1	15	4	15	4	Then the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”
366	1	15	5	15	5	And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.”
367	1	15	6	15	6	Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
368	1	15	7	15	7	The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”
369	1	15	8	15	8	But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”
370	1	15	9	15	9	And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
371	1	15	10	15	10	So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut.
372	1	15	11	15	11	And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
373	1	15	12	15	12	As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.
374	1	15	13	15	13	Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own; they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
375	1	15	14	15	14	But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions.
376	1	15	15	15	15	You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
377	1	15	16	15	16	In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
378	1	15	17	15	17	When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses.
379	1	15	18	15	18	On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—
380	1	15	19	15	19	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
381	1	15	20	15	20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
382	1	15	21	15	21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
383	1	16	1	16	1	Now Abram’s wife Sarai had not borne a child to him, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
384	1	16	2	16	2	So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
385	1	16	3	16	3	So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.
386	1	16	4	16	4	And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
387	1	16	5	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”
388	1	16	6	16	6	“Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.
389	1	16	7	16	7	Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.
390	1	16	8	16	8	“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.
391	1	16	9	16	9	So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.”
392	1	16	10	16	10	Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”
393	1	16	11	16	11	The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.
394	1	16	12	16	12	He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him; he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”
395	1	16	13	16	13	So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!”
396	1	16	14	16	14	Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
397	1	16	15	16	15	And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
398	1	16	16	16	16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
399	1	17	1	17	1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty. Walk before Me and be blameless.
400	1	17	2	17	2	I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.”
401	1	17	3	17	3	Then Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
402	1	17	4	17	4	“As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
403	1	17	5	17	5	No longer will you be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
404	1	17	6	17	6	I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you.
405	1	17	7	17	7	I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
406	1	17	8	17	8	And to you and your descendants I will give the land where you are residing—all the land of Canaan—as an eternal possession; and I will be their God.”
407	1	17	9	17	9	God also said to Abraham, “You must keep My covenant—you and your descendants in the generations after you.
408	1	17	10	17	10	This is My covenant with you and your descendants after you, which you are to keep: Every male among you must be circumcised.
409	1	17	11	17	11	You are to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and this will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
410	1	17	12	17	12	Generation after generation, every male must be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those purchased from a foreigner—even those who are not your offspring.
411	1	17	13	17	13	Whether they are born in your household or purchased, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant.
412	1	17	14	17	14	But if any male is not circumcised, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
413	1	17	15	17	15	Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah.
414	1	17	16	17	16	And I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.”
415	1	17	17	17	17	Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?”
416	1	17	18	17	18	And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!”
417	1	17	19	17	19	But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
418	1	17	20	17	20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
419	1	17	21	17	21	But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”
420	1	17	22	17	22	When He had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
421	1	17	23	17	23	On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and he circumcised them, just as God had told him.
422	1	17	24	17	24	So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
423	1	17	25	17	25	and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
424	1	17	26	17	26	Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day.
425	1	17	27	17	27	And all the men of Abraham’s household—both servants born in his household and those purchased from foreigners—were circumcised with him.
426	1	18	1	18	1	Then the LORD appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre in the heat of the day, while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent.
427	1	18	2	18	2	And Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
428	1	18	3	18	3	“My lord,” said Abraham, “if I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by.
429	1	18	4	18	4	Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree.
430	1	18	5	18	5	And I will bring a bit of bread so that you may refresh yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant’s way. After that, you may continue on your way.” “Yes,” they replied, “you may do as you have said.”
431	1	18	6	18	6	So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.”
432	1	18	7	18	7	Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender, choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
433	1	18	8	18	8	Then Abraham brought curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and he set them before the men and stood by them under the tree as they ate.
434	1	18	9	18	9	“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked. “There, in the tent,” he replied.
435	1	18	10	18	10	Then the LORD said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” Now Sarah was behind him, listening at the entrance to the tent.
436	1	18	11	18	11	And Abraham and Sarah were already old and well along in years. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
437	1	18	12	18	12	So she laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
438	1	18	13	18	13	And the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?’
439	1	18	14	18	14	Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you—in about a year—and Sarah will have a son.”
440	1	18	15	18	15	But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh.” For she was afraid. “No,” replied the LORD, “but you did laugh.”
441	1	18	16	18	16	When the men got up to leave they looked out over Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them off.
442	1	18	17	18	17	And the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
443	1	18	18	18	18	Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and through him all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
444	1	18	19	18	19	For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised.”
445	1	18	20	18	20	Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Because their sin is so grievous,
446	1	18	21	18	21	I will go down to see if their actions fully justify the outcry that has reached Me. If not, I will find out.”
447	1	18	22	18	22	And the two men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
448	1	18	23	18	23	Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
449	1	18	24	18	24	What if there are fifty righteous ones in the city? Will You really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones who are there?
450	1	18	25	18	25	Far be it from You to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?”
451	1	18	26	18	26	So the LORD replied, “If I find fifty righteous ones within the city of Sodom, on their account I will spare the whole place.”
452	1	18	27	18	27	Then Abraham answered, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord—though I am but dust and ashes—
453	1	18	28	18	28	suppose the fifty righteous ones lack five. Will You destroy the whole city for the lack of five?” He replied, “If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.”
454	1	18	29	18	29	Once again Abraham spoke to the LORD, “Suppose forty are found there?” He answered, “On account of the forty, I will not do it.”
455	1	18	30	18	30	Then Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak further. Suppose thirty are found there?” He replied, “If I find thirty there, I will not do it.”
456	1	18	31	18	31	And Abraham said, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose twenty are found there?” He answered, “On account of the twenty, I will not destroy it.”
457	1	18	32	18	32	Finally, Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak once more. Suppose ten are found there?” And He answered, “On account of the ten, I will not destroy it.”
458	1	18	33	18	33	When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, He departed, and Abraham returned home.
459	1	19	1	19	1	Now the two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When Lot saw them, he got up to meet them, bowed facedown,
460	1	19	2	19	2	and said, “My lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant; wash your feet and spend the night. Then you can rise early and go on your way.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”
461	1	19	3	19	3	But Lot insisted so strongly that they followed him into his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
462	1	19	4	19	4	Before they had gone to bed, all the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house.
463	1	19	5	19	5	They called out to Lot, saying, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Send them out to us so we can have relations with them!”
464	1	19	6	19	6	Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him.
465	1	19	7	19	7	“Please, my brothers,” he pleaded, “don’t do such a wicked thing!
466	1	19	8	19	8	Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them to you, and you can do to them as you please. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
467	1	19	9	19	9	“Get out of the way!” they replied. And they declared, “This one came here as a foreigner, and he is already acting like a judge! Now we will treat you worse than them.” And they pressed in on Lot and moved in to break down the door.
468	1	19	10	19	10	But the men inside reached out, pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
469	1	19	11	19	11	And they struck the men at the entrance, young and old, with blindness, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the door.
470	1	19	12	19	12	Then the two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—a son-in-law, your sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
471	1	19	13	19	13	because we are about to destroy this place. For the outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that He has sent us to destroy it.”
472	1	19	14	19	14	So Lot went out and spoke to the sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters. “Get up,” he said. “Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
473	1	19	15	19	15	At daybreak the angels hurried Lot along, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.”
474	1	19	16	19	16	But when Lot hesitated, the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters. And they led them safely out of the city, because of the LORD’s compassion for them.
475	1	19	17	19	17	As soon as the men had brought them out, one of them said, “Run for your lives! Do not look back, and do not stop anywhere on the plain! Flee to the mountains, or you will be swept away!”
476	1	19	18	19	18	But Lot replied, “No, my lords, please!
477	1	19	19	19	19	Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness by sparing my life. But I cannot run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
478	1	19	20	19	20	Look, this town is near enough for me flee to it, and it is a small place. Please let me flee there—is it not a small place? Then my life will be saved.”
479	1	19	21	19	21	“Very well,” he answered, “I will grant this request as well, and will not demolish the town you indicate.
480	1	19	22	19	22	Hurry! Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you reach it.” That is why the town was called Zoar.
481	1	19	23	19	23	By the time the sun had risen over the land, Lot had reached Zoar.
482	1	19	24	19	24	Then the LORD rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens.
483	1	19	25	19	25	Thus He destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground.
484	1	19	26	19	26	But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
485	1	19	27	19	27	Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
486	1	19	28	19	28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace.
487	1	19	29	19	29	So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe that destroyed the cities where he had lived.
488	1	19	30	19	30	Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains—for he was afraid to stay in Zoar—where they lived in a cave.
489	1	19	31	19	31	One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth.
490	1	19	32	19	32	Come, let us get our father drunk with wine, so that we can sleep with him and preserve his line.”
491	1	19	33	19	33	So that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn came and slept with her father; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up.
492	1	19	34	19	34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let us get him drunk with wine again tonight, so you can go sleep with him, and we can preserve our father’s line.”
493	1	19	35	19	35	So again that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the younger daughter went and slept with him; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up.
494	1	19	36	19	36	Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
495	1	19	37	19	37	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today.
496	1	19	38	19	38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today.
497	1	20	1	20	1	Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar,
498	1	20	2	20	2	Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
499	1	20	3	20	3	One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”
500	1	20	4	20	4	Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?
501	1	20	5	20	5	Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”
502	1	20	6	20	6	Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
503	1	20	7	20	7	Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.”
504	1	20	8	20	8	Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified.
505	1	20	9	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”
506	1	20	10	20	10	Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?”
507	1	20	11	20	11	Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’
508	1	20	12	20	12	Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife.
509	1	20	13	20	13	So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
510	1	20	14	20	14	So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him.
511	1	20	15	20	15	And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.”
512	1	20	16	20	16	And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.”
513	1	20	17	20	17	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children—
514	1	20	18	20	18	for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household.
515	1	21	1	21	1	Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised.
516	1	21	2	21	2	So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.
517	1	21	3	21	3	And Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore to him.
518	1	21	4	21	4	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.
519	1	21	5	21	5	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
520	1	21	6	21	6	Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.”
521	1	21	7	21	7	She added, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
522	1	21	8	21	8	So the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
523	1	21	9	21	9	But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son,
524	1	21	10	21	10	and she said to Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!”
525	1	21	11	21	11	Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael.
526	1	21	12	21	12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.
527	1	21	13	21	13	But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s son, because he is your offspring.”
528	1	21	14	21	14	Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba.
529	1	21	15	21	15	When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
530	1	21	16	21	16	Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept.
531	1	21	17	21	17	Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies.
532	1	21	18	21	18	Arise, lift up the boy and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
533	1	21	19	21	19	Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
534	1	21	20	21	20	And God was with the boy, and he grew up and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer.
535	1	21	21	21	21	And while he was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
536	1	21	22	21	22	At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do.
537	1	21	23	21	23	Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown to you.”
538	1	21	24	21	24	And Abraham replied, “I swear it.”
539	1	21	25	21	25	But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized,
540	1	21	26	21	26	Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so I have not heard about it until today.”
541	1	21	27	21	27	So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
542	1	21	28	21	28	Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock,
543	1	21	29	21	29	and Abimelech asked him, “Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?”
544	1	21	30	21	30	He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.”
545	1	21	31	21	31	So that place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.
546	1	21	32	21	32	After they had made the covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
547	1	21	33	21	33	And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
548	1	21	34	21	34	And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
549	1	22	1	22	1	Some time later God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he answered.
550	1	22	2	22	2	“Take your son,” God said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.”
551	1	22	3	22	3	So Abraham got up early the next morning, saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had designated.
552	1	22	4	22	4	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
553	1	22	5	22	5	“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told his servants. “The boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we will return to you.”
554	1	22	6	22	6	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together.
555	1	22	7	22	7	Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” “Here I am, my son,” he replied. “The fire and the wood are here,” said Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
556	1	22	8	22	8	Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two walked on together.
557	1	22	9	22	9	When they arrived at the place God had designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood.
558	1	22	10	22	10	Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
559	1	22	11	22	11	Just then, the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied.
560	1	22	12	22	12	“Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.”
561	1	22	13	22	13	Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
562	1	22	14	22	14	And Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. So to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”
563	1	22	15	22	15	And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
564	1	22	16	22	16	saying, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your only son,
565	1	22	17	22	17	I will surely bless you, and I will multiply your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.
566	1	22	18	22	18	And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.”
567	1	22	19	22	19	Abraham went back to his servants, and they got up and set out together for Beersheba. And Abraham settled in Beersheba.
568	1	22	20	22	20	Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor:
569	1	22	21	22	21	Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
570	1	22	22	22	22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
571	1	22	23	22	23	And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
572	1	22	24	22	24	Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
573	1	23	1	23	1	Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old.
574	1	23	2	23	2	She died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went out to mourn and to weep for her.
575	1	23	3	23	3	Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and said to the Hittites,
576	1	23	4	23	4	“I am a stranger and an outsider among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead.”
577	1	23	5	23	5	The Hittites replied to Abraham,
578	1	23	6	23	6	“Listen to us, sir. You are God’s chosen one among us. Bury your dead in the finest of our tombs. None of us will withhold his tomb for burying your dead.”
579	1	23	7	23	7	Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.
580	1	23	8	23	8	“If you are willing for me to bury my dead,” he said to them, “listen to me, and approach Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
581	1	23	9	23	9	to sell me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence for full price, so that I may have a burial site.”
582	1	23	10	23	10	Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham,
583	1	23	11	23	11	“No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”
584	1	23	12	23	12	Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
585	1	23	13	23	13	and said to Ephron in their presence, “If you will please listen to me, I will pay you the price of the field. Accept it from me, so that I may bury my dead there.”
586	1	23	14	23	14	Ephron answered Abraham,
587	1	23	15	23	15	“Listen to me, my lord. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”
588	1	23	16	23	16	Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard of the merchants.
589	1	23	17	23	17	So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near Mamre, the cave that was in it, and all the trees within the boundaries of the field, were deeded over
590	1	23	18	23	18	to Abraham’s possession in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
591	1	23	19	23	19	After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
592	1	23	20	23	20	So the field and its cave were deeded by the Hittites to Abraham as a burial site.
593	1	24	1	24	1	By now Abraham was old and well along in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
594	1	24	2	24	2	So Abraham instructed the chief servant of his household, who managed all he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh,
595	1	24	3	24	3	and I will have you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am dwelling,
596	1	24	4	24	4	but will go to my country and my kindred to take a wife for my son Isaac.”
597	1	24	5	24	5	The servant asked him, “What if the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”
598	1	24	6	24	6	Abraham replied, “Make sure that you do not take my son back there.
599	1	24	7	24	7	The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me from my father’s house and my native land, who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you so that you can take a wife for my son from there.
600	1	24	8	24	8	And if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”
601	1	24	9	24	9	So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
602	1	24	10	24	10	Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in hand. And he set out for Nahor’s hometown in Aram-naharaim.
603	1	24	11	24	11	As evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town at the time when the women went out to draw water.
604	1	24	12	24	12	“O LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he prayed, “please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
605	1	24	13	24	13	Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
606	1	24	14	24	14	Now may it happen that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”
607	1	24	15	24	15	Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
608	1	24	16	24	16	Now the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again.
609	1	24	17	24	17	So the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jar.”
610	1	24	18	24	18	“Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
611	1	24	19	24	19	After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.”
612	1	24	20	24	20	And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his camels.
613	1	24	21	24	21	Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success.
614	1	24	22	24	22	And after the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka, and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels.
615	1	24	23	24	23	“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”
616	1	24	24	24	24	She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.”
617	1	24	25	24	25	Then she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend the night.”
618	1	24	26	24	26	Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
619	1	24	27	24	27	saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”
620	1	24	28	24	28	The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
621	1	24	29	24	29	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he rushed out to the man at the spring.
622	1	24	30	24	30	As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and heard Rebekah’s words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man standing by the camels near the spring.
623	1	24	31	24	31	“Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
624	1	24	32	24	32	So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions.
625	1	24	33	24	33	Then a meal was set before the man, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.” So Laban said, “Please speak.”
626	1	24	34	24	34	“I am Abraham’s servant,” he replied.
627	1	24	35	24	35	“The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys.
628	1	24	36	24	36	My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him everything he owns.
629	1	24	37	24	37	My master made me swear an oath and said, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell,
630	1	24	38	24	38	but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.’
631	1	24	39	24	39	Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’
632	1	24	40	24	40	And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house.
633	1	24	41	24	41	And when you go to my kindred, if they refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’
634	1	24	42	24	42	So when I came to the spring today, I prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my journey a success!
635	1	24	43	24	43	Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar,’
636	1	24	44	24	44	and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will draw water for your camels as well,’ may she be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.
637	1	24	45	24	45	And before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
638	1	24	46	24	46	She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
639	1	24	47	24	47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
640	1	24	48	24	48	Then I bowed down and worshiped the LORD; and I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.
641	1	24	49	24	49	Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that I may go elsewhere.”
642	1	24	50	24	50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter.
643	1	24	51	24	51	Rebekah is here before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, just as the LORD has decreed.”
644	1	24	52	24	52	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
645	1	24	53	24	53	Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother.
646	1	24	54	24	54	Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”
647	1	24	55	24	55	But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.”
648	1	24	56	24	56	But he replied, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master.”
649	1	24	57	24	57	So they said, “We will call the girl and ask her opinion.”
650	1	24	58	24	58	They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” “I will go,” she replied.
651	1	24	59	24	59	So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.
652	1	24	60	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands upon thousands. May your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.”
653	1	24	61	24	61	Then Rebekah and her servant girls got ready, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
654	1	24	62	24	62	Now Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev.
655	1	24	63	24	63	Early in the evening, Isaac went out to the field to meditate, and looking up, he saw the camels approaching.
656	1	24	64	24	64	And when Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she got down from her camel
657	1	24	65	24	65	and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” “It is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
658	1	24	66	24	66	Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done.
659	1	24	67	24	67	And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after his mother’s death.
660	1	25	1	25	1	Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,
661	1	25	2	25	2	and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
662	1	25	3	25	3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.
663	1	25	4	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
664	1	25	5	25	5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
665	1	25	6	25	6	But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
666	1	25	7	25	7	Abraham lived a total of 175 years.
667	1	25	8	25	8	And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.
668	1	25	9	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.
669	1	25	10	25	10	This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.
670	1	25	11	25	11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.
671	1	25	12	25	12	This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.
672	1	25	13	25	13	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
673	1	25	14	25	14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
674	1	25	15	25	15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
675	1	25	16	25	16	These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.
676	1	25	17	25	17	Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
677	1	25	18	25	18	Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
678	1	25	19	25	19	This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,
679	1	25	20	25	20	and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.
680	1	25	21	25	21	Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
681	1	25	22	25	22	But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,
682	1	25	23	25	23	and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”
683	1	25	24	25	24	When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.
684	1	25	25	25	25	The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.
685	1	25	26	25	26	After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.
686	1	25	27	25	27	When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.
687	1	25	28	25	28	Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
688	1	25	29	25	29	One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.
689	1	25	30	25	30	He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.)
690	1	25	31	25	31	“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.
691	1	25	32	25	32	“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”
692	1	25	33	25	33	“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.
693	1	25	34	25	34	Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
694	1	26	1	26	1	Now there was another famine in the land, subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.
695	1	26	2	26	2	The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Settle in the land where I tell you.
696	1	26	3	26	3	Stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.
697	1	26	4	26	4	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,
698	1	26	5	26	5	because Abraham listened to My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”
699	1	26	6	26	6	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
700	1	26	7	26	7	But when the men of that place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” since he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is so beautiful.”
701	1	26	8	26	8	When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
702	1	26	9	26	9	Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.”
703	1	26	10	26	10	“What is this you have done to us?” asked Abimelech. “One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
704	1	26	11	26	11	So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”
705	1	26	12	26	12	Now Isaac sowed seed in the land, and in that very year he reaped a hundredfold. And the LORD blessed him,
706	1	26	13	26	13	and he became richer and richer, until he was exceedingly wealthy.
707	1	26	14	26	14	He owned so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
708	1	26	15	26	15	So the Philistines took dirt and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.
709	1	26	16	26	16	Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Depart from us, for you are much too powerful for us.”
710	1	26	17	26	17	So Isaac left that place and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
711	1	26	18	26	18	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. And he gave these wells the same names his father had given them.
712	1	26	19	26	19	Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water there.
713	1	26	20	26	20	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they contended with him.
714	1	26	21	26	21	Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
715	1	26	22	26	22	He moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth and said, “At last the LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”
716	1	26	23	26	23	From there Isaac went up to Beersheba,
717	1	26	24	26	24	and that night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.”
718	1	26	25	26	25	So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there. His servants also dug a well there.
719	1	26	26	26	26	Later, Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
720	1	26	27	26	27	“Why have you come to me?” Isaac asked them. “You hated me and sent me away.”
721	1	26	28	26	28	“We can plainly see that the LORD has been with you,” they replied. “We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you
722	1	26	29	26	29	that you will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only good to you, sending you on your way in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD.”
723	1	26	30	26	30	So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
724	1	26	31	26	31	And they got up early the next morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
725	1	26	32	26	32	On that same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We have found water!” they told him.
726	1	26	33	26	33	So he called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba.
727	1	26	34	26	34	When Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
728	1	26	35	26	35	And they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
729	1	27	1	27	1	When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” “Here I am,” Esau replied.
730	1	27	2	27	2	“Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old, and I do not know the day of my death.
731	1	27	3	27	3	Take your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out into the field to hunt some game for me.
732	1	27	4	27	4	Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”
733	1	27	5	27	5	Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back,
734	1	27	6	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father saying to your brother Esau,
735	1	27	7	27	7	‘Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.’
736	1	27	8	27	8	Now, my son, listen to my voice and do exactly as I tell you.
737	1	27	9	27	9	Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father—the kind he loves.
738	1	27	10	27	10	Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”
739	1	27	11	27	11	Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned.
740	1	27	12	27	12	What if my father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.”
741	1	27	13	27	13	His mother replied, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.”
742	1	27	14	27	14	So Jacob went and got two goats and brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved.
743	1	27	15	27	15	And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob.
744	1	27	16	27	16	She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
745	1	27	17	27	17	Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread she had made.
746	1	27	18	27	18	So Jacob went to his father and said, “My father.” “Here I am!” he answered. “Which one are you, my son?”
747	1	27	19	27	19	Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.”
748	1	27	20	27	20	But Isaac asked his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?” “Because the LORD your God brought it to me,” he replied.
749	1	27	21	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau or not?”
750	1	27	22	27	22	So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
751	1	27	23	27	23	Isaac did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
752	1	27	24	27	24	Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he replied, “I am.”
753	1	27	25	27	25	“Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then he brought him wine, and he drank.
754	1	27	26	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.”
755	1	27	27	27	27	So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said: “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
756	1	27	28	27	28	May God give to you the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth—an abundance of grain and new wine.
757	1	27	29	27	29	May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. May you be the master of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed.”
758	1	27	30	27	30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him and Jacob had left his father’s presence, his brother Esau returned from the hunt.
759	1	27	31	27	31	He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father, and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son’s game, so that you may bless me.”
760	1	27	32	27	32	But his father Isaac replied, “Who are you?” “I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered.
761	1	27	33	27	33	Isaac began to tremble violently and said, “Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him—and indeed, he will be blessed!”
762	1	27	34	27	34	When Esau heard his father’s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, O my father!”
763	1	27	35	27	35	But Isaac replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
764	1	27	36	27	36	So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”
765	1	27	37	27	37	But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”
766	1	27	38	27	38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.
767	1	27	39	27	39	His father Isaac answered him: “Behold, your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land, away from the dew of heaven above.
768	1	27	40	27	40	You shall live by the sword and serve your brother. But when you rebel, you will tear his yoke from your neck.”
769	1	27	41	27	41	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart: “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
770	1	27	42	27	42	When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you.
771	1	27	43	27	43	So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
772	1	27	44	27	44	Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s fury subsides—
773	1	27	45	27	45	until your brother’s rage against you wanes and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
774	1	27	46	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them, what good is my life?”
775	1	28	1	28	1	So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. “Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” he commanded.
776	1	28	2	28	2	“Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
777	1	28	3	28	3	May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples.
778	1	28	4	28	4	And may He give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants, so that you may possess the land where you dwell as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”
779	1	28	5	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
780	1	28	6	28	6	Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife there, commanding him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”
781	1	28	7	28	7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
782	1	28	8	28	8	And seeing that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,
783	1	28	9	28	9	Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, in addition to the wives he already had.
784	1	28	10	28	10	Meanwhile Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.
785	1	28	11	28	11	On reaching a certain place, he spent the night there because the sun had set. And taking one of the stones from that place, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
786	1	28	12	28	12	And Jacob had a dream about a ladder that rested on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven, and God’s angels were going up and down the ladder.
787	1	28	13	28	13	And there at the top the LORD was standing and saying, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you now lie.
788	1	28	14	28	14	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and east and north and south. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
789	1	28	15	28	15	Look, I am with you, and I will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
790	1	28	16	28	16	When Jacob woke up, he thought, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware of it.”
791	1	28	17	28	17	And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!”
792	1	28	18	28	18	Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone that he had placed under his head, and he set it up as a pillar. He poured oil on top of it,
793	1	28	19	28	19	and he called that place Bethel, though previously the city had been named Luz.
794	1	28	20	28	20	Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey, and if He will provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear,
795	1	28	21	28	21	so that I may return safely to my father’s house, then the LORD will be my God.
796	1	28	22	28	22	And this stone I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give You a tenth.”
797	1	29	1	29	1	Jacob resumed his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.
798	1	29	2	29	2	He looked and saw a well in the field, and there by it lay three flocks of sheep, because the sheep were watered from this well. And a large stone covered the mouth of the well.
799	1	29	3	29	3	When all the flocks had been gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
800	1	29	4	29	4	“My brothers,” Jacob asked the shepherds, “where are you from?” “We are from Haran,” they answered.
801	1	29	5	29	5	“Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked. “We know him,” they replied.
802	1	29	6	29	6	“Is he well?” Jacob inquired. “Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.”
803	1	29	7	29	7	“Look,” said Jacob, “it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”
804	1	29	8	29	8	But they replied, “We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”
805	1	29	9	29	9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
806	1	29	10	29	10	As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother Laban, with Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.
807	1	29	11	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
808	1	29	12	29	12	He told Rachel that he was Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her father.
809	1	29	13	29	13	When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that had happened.
810	1	29	14	29	14	Then Laban declared, “You are indeed my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him a month,
811	1	29	15	29	15	Laban said to him, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”
812	1	29	16	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel.
813	1	29	17	29	17	Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful.
814	1	29	18	29	18	Since Jacob loved Rachel, he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
815	1	29	19	29	19	Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to another. Stay here with me.”
816	1	29	20	29	20	So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love for her.
817	1	29	21	29	21	Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.”
818	1	29	22	29	22	So Laban invited all the men of that place and prepared a feast.
819	1	29	23	29	23	But when evening came, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her.
820	1	29	24	29	24	And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.
821	1	29	25	29	25	When morning came, there was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn’t it for Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?”
822	1	29	26	29	26	Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older.
823	1	29	27	29	27	Finish this week’s celebration, and we will give you the younger one in return for another seven years of work.”
824	1	29	28	29	28	And Jacob did just that. He finished the week’s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.
825	1	29	29	29	29	Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
826	1	29	30	29	30	Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban another seven years.
827	1	29	31	29	31	When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
828	1	29	32	29	32	And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, “The LORD has seen my affliction. Surely my husband will love me now.”
829	1	29	33	29	33	Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son as well.” So she named him Simeon.
830	1	29	34	29	34	Once again Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.
831	1	29	35	29	35	And once more she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children.
832	1	30	1	30	1	When Rachel saw that she was not bearing any children for Jacob, she envied her sister. “Give me children, or I will die!” she said to Jacob.
833	1	30	2	30	2	Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld children from you?”
834	1	30	3	30	3	Then she said, “Here is my maidservant Bilhah. Sleep with her, that she may bear children for me, so that through her I too can build a family.”
835	1	30	4	30	4	So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as his wife, and he slept with her,
836	1	30	5	30	5	and Bilhah conceived and bore him a son.
837	1	30	6	30	6	Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; He has heard my plea and given me a son.” So she named him Dan.
838	1	30	7	30	7	And Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
839	1	30	8	30	8	Then Rachel said, “In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister and won.” So she named him Naphtali.
840	1	30	9	30	9	When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife.
841	1	30	10	30	10	And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
842	1	30	11	30	11	Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad.
843	1	30	12	30	12	When Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son,
844	1	30	13	30	13	Leah said, “How happy I am, for the women call me happy.” So she named him Asher.
845	1	30	14	30	14	Now during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field. When he brought them to his mother, Rachel begged Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
846	1	30	15	30	15	But Leah replied, “Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes as well?” “Very well,” said Rachel, “he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”
847	1	30	16	30	16	When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night.
848	1	30	17	30	17	And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore a fifth son to Jacob.
849	1	30	18	30	18	Then Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.
850	1	30	19	30	19	Again Leah conceived and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
851	1	30	20	30	20	“God has given me a good gift,” she said. “This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she named him Zebulun.
852	1	30	21	30	21	After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
853	1	30	22	30	22	Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb,
854	1	30	23	30	23	and she conceived and gave birth to a son. “God has taken away my shame,” she said.
855	1	30	24	30	24	She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.”
856	1	30	25	30	25	Now after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland.
857	1	30	26	30	26	Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you, that I may go on my way. You know how hard I have worked for you.”
858	1	30	27	30	27	But Laban replied, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.”
859	1	30	28	30	28	And he added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
860	1	30	29	30	29	Then Jacob answered, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock have thrived under my care.
861	1	30	30	30	30	Indeed, you had very little before my arrival, but now your wealth has increased many times over. The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot. But now, when may I also provide for my own household?”
862	1	30	31	30	31	“What can I give you?” Laban asked. “You do not need to give me anything,” Jacob replied. “If you do this one thing for me, I will keep on shepherding and keeping your flocks.
863	1	30	32	30	32	Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. These will be my wages.
864	1	30	33	30	33	So my honesty will testify for me when you come to check on my wages in the future. If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored, they will be considered stolen.”
865	1	30	34	30	34	“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”
866	1	30	35	30	35	That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored lamb, and he placed them under the care of his sons.
867	1	30	36	30	36	Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flocks.
868	1	30	37	30	37	Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled the bark, exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
869	1	30	38	30	38	Then he set the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of the flocks coming in to drink. So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
870	1	30	39	30	39	they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
871	1	30	40	30	40	Jacob set apart the young, but made the rest face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and did not put them with Laban’s animals.
872	1	30	41	30	41	Whenever the stronger females of the flock were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they would breed in front of the branches.
873	1	30	42	30	42	But if the animals were weak, he did not set out the branches. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.
874	1	30	43	30	43	Thus Jacob became exceedingly prosperous. He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.
875	1	31	1	31	1	Now Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father and built all this wealth at our father’s expense.”
876	1	31	2	31	2	And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban that his attitude toward him had changed.
877	1	31	3	31	3	Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”
878	1	31	4	31	4	So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were,
879	1	31	5	31	5	and he told them, “I can see from your father’s countenance that his attitude toward me has changed; but the God of my father has been with me.
880	1	31	6	31	6	You know that I have served your father with all my strength.
881	1	31	7	31	7	And although he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, God has not allowed him to harm me.
882	1	31	8	31	8	If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore speckled offspring. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then the whole flock bore streaked offspring.
883	1	31	9	31	9	Thus God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me.
884	1	31	10	31	10	When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females.
885	1	31	11	31	11	In that dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ And I replied, ‘Here I am.’
886	1	31	12	31	12	‘Look up,’ he said, ‘and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled; for I have seen all that Laban has done to you.
887	1	31	13	31	13	I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a solemn vow to Me. Now get up and leave this land at once, and return to your native land.’”
888	1	31	14	31	14	And Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father’s house?
889	1	31	15	31	15	Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? Not only has he sold us, but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us.
890	1	31	16	31	16	Surely all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you.”
891	1	31	17	31	17	Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on camels,
892	1	31	18	31	18	and he drove all his livestock before him, along with all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan.
893	1	31	19	31	19	Now while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols.
894	1	31	20	31	20	Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was running away.
895	1	31	21	31	21	So he fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.
896	1	31	22	31	22	On the third day Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.
897	1	31	23	31	23	So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.
898	1	31	24	31	24	But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
899	1	31	25	31	25	Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there as well.
900	1	31	26	31	26	Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives of war!
901	1	31	27	31	27	Why did you run away secretly and deceive me, without even telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps.
902	1	31	28	31	28	But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and daughters goodbye. Now you have done a foolish thing.
903	1	31	29	31	29	I have power to do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’
904	1	31	30	31	30	Now you have gone off because you long for your father’s house. But why have you stolen my gods?”
905	1	31	31	31	31	“I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
906	1	31	32	31	32	If you find your gods with anyone here, he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself if anything is yours, and take it back.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols.
907	1	31	33	31	33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, then Leah’s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.
908	1	31	34	31	34	Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of her camel, and was sitting on them. And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing.
909	1	31	35	31	35	Rachel said to her father, “Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.” So Laban searched, but could not find the household idols.
910	1	31	36	31	36	Then Jacob became incensed and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said. “For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me?
911	1	31	37	31	37	You have searched all my goods! Have you found anything that belongs to you? Put it here before my brothers and yours, that they may judge between the two of us.
912	1	31	38	31	38	I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flock.
913	1	31	39	31	39	I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night.
914	1	31	40	31	40	As it was, the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
915	1	31	41	31	41	Thus for twenty years I have served in your household—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks—and you have changed my wages ten times!
916	1	31	42	31	42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and last night He rendered judgment.”
917	1	31	43	31	43	But Laban answered Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, and these flocks are my flocks! Everything you see is mine! Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne?
918	1	31	44	31	44	Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.”
919	1	31	45	31	45	So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a pillar,
920	1	31	46	31	46	and he said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a mound, and there by the mound they ate.
921	1	31	47	31	47	Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
922	1	31	48	31	48	Then Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore the place was called Galeed.
923	1	31	49	31	49	It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent from one another.
924	1	31	50	31	50	If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, although no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”
925	1	31	51	31	51	Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is the mound, and here is the pillar I have set up between you and me.
926	1	31	52	31	52	This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this mound to harm you, and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me.
927	1	31	53	31	53	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
928	1	31	54	31	54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. And after they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.
929	1	32	1	31	55	Early the next morning, Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then he left to return home.
930	1	32	2	32	1	Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
931	1	32	3	32	2	When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim.
932	1	32	4	32	3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
933	1	32	5	32	4	He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now.
934	1	32	6	32	5	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.’”
935	1	32	7	32	6	When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau; he is coming to meet you—he and four hundred men with him.”
936	1	32	8	32	7	In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels.
937	1	32	9	32	8	He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.”
938	1	32	10	32	9	Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’
939	1	32	11	32	10	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps.
940	1	32	12	32	11	Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me.
941	1	32	13	32	12	But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.’”
942	1	32	14	32	13	Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau:
943	1	32	15	32	14	200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,
944	1	32	16	32	15	30 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.
945	1	32	17	32	16	He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.”
946	1	32	18	32	17	He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’
947	1	32	19	32	18	then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’”
948	1	32	20	32	19	He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him.
949	1	32	21	32	20	You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.”
950	1	32	22	32	21	So Jacob’s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp.
951	1	32	23	32	22	During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
952	1	32	24	32	23	He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.
953	1	32	25	32	24	So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
954	1	32	26	32	25	When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled.
955	1	32	27	32	26	Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
956	1	32	28	32	27	“What is your name?” the man asked. “Jacob,” he replied.
957	1	32	29	32	28	Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”
958	1	32	30	32	29	And Jacob inquired, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.
959	1	32	31	32	30	So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
960	1	32	32	32	31	The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.
961	1	32	33	32	32	Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon which is at the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon.
962	1	33	1	33	1	Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
963	1	33	2	33	2	He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
964	1	33	3	33	3	But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
965	1	33	4	33	4	Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.
966	1	33	5	33	5	When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.”
967	1	33	6	33	6	Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
968	1	33	7	33	7	Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.
969	1	33	8	33	8	“What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. “To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered.
970	1	33	9	33	9	“I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.”
971	1	33	10	33	10	But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably.
972	1	33	11	33	11	Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted.
973	1	33	12	33	12	Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.”
974	1	33	13	33	13	But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die.
975	1	33	14	33	14	Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
976	1	33	15	33	15	“Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
977	1	33	16	33	16	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,
978	1	33	17	33	17	but Jacob went on to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.
979	1	33	18	33	18	After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city.
980	1	33	19	33	19	And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.
981	1	33	20	33	20	There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
982	1	34	1	34	1	Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.
983	1	34	2	34	2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force.
984	1	34	3	34	3	And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly.
985	1	34	4	34	4	So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.”
986	1	34	5	34	5	Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent about it until they returned.
987	1	34	6	34	6	Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob.
988	1	34	7	34	7	When Jacob’s sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.
989	1	34	8	34	8	But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
990	1	34	9	34	9	Intermarry with us; give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves.
991	1	34	10	34	10	You may settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.”
992	1	34	11	34	11	Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you ask.
993	1	34	12	34	12	Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!”
994	1	34	13	34	13	But because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah, Jacob’s sons answered him and his father Hamor deceitfully.
995	1	34	14	34	14	“We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us.
996	1	34	15	34	15	We will consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like us—every one of your males.
997	1	34	16	34	16	Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people.
998	1	34	17	34	17	But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and go.”
999	1	34	18	34	18	Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
1000	1	34	19	34	19	The young man, who was the most respected of all his father’s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
1001	1	34	20	34	20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city:
1002	1	34	21	34	21	“These men are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them.
1003	1	34	22	34	22	But only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are circumcised as they are.
1004	1	34	23	34	23	Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell among us.”
1005	1	34	24	34	24	All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised.
1006	1	34	25	34	25	Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every male.
1007	1	34	26	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
1008	1	34	27	34	27	Jacob’s other sons came upon the slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled.
1009	1	34	28	34	28	They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in the city or in the field.
1010	1	34	29	34	29	They carried off all their possessions and women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses.
1011	1	34	30	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me by making me repugnant to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
1012	1	34	31	34	31	But Simeon and Levi answered, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”
1013	1	35	1	35	1	Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
1014	1	35	2	35	2	So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments.
1015	1	35	3	35	3	Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.”
1016	1	35	4	35	4	So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.
1017	1	35	5	35	5	As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons.
1018	1	35	6	35	6	So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
1019	1	35	7	35	7	There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother.
1020	1	35	8	35	8	Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth.
1021	1	35	9	35	9	After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.
1022	1	35	10	35	10	And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob, you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel.” So God named him Israel.
1023	1	35	11	35	11	And God told him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation—even a company of nations—shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you.
1024	1	35	12	35	12	The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”
1025	1	35	13	35	13	Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him.
1026	1	35	14	35	14	So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him—a stone marker—and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.
1027	1	35	15	35	15	Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
1028	1	35	16	35	16	Later, they set out from Bethel, and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult.
1029	1	35	17	35	17	During her severe labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you are having another son.”
1030	1	35	18	35	18	And with her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni. But his father called him Benjamin.
1031	1	35	19	35	19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
1032	1	35	20	35	20	Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day.
1033	1	35	21	35	21	Israel again set out and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
1034	1	35	22	35	22	While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons:
1035	1	35	23	35	23	The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
1036	1	35	24	35	24	The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
1037	1	35	25	35	25	The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
1038	1	35	26	35	26	And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
1039	1	35	27	35	27	Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
1040	1	35	28	35	28	And Isaac lived 180 years.
1041	1	35	29	35	29	Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
1042	1	36	1	36	1	This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom).
1043	1	36	2	36	2	Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
1044	1	36	3	36	3	and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
1045	1	36	4	36	4	And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath gave birth to Reuel,
1046	1	36	5	36	5	and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
1047	1	36	6	36	6	Later, Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the people of his household, along with his livestock, all his other animals, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan, and he moved to a land far away from his brother Jacob.
1048	1	36	7	36	7	For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together; the land where they stayed could not support them because of their livestock.
1049	1	36	8	36	8	So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the area of Mount Seir.
1050	1	36	9	36	9	This is the account of Esau, the father of the Edomites, in the area of Mount Seir.
1051	1	36	10	36	10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz son of Esau’s wife Adah, and Reuel son of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1052	1	36	11	36	11	The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
1053	1	36	12	36	12	Additionally, Timna, a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz, gave birth to Amalek. These are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Adah.
1054	1	36	13	36	13	These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1055	1	36	14	36	14	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah (daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon) whom she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
1056	1	36	15	36	15	These are the chiefs among the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
1057	1	36	16	36	16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. They are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom, and they are the grandsons of Adah.
1058	1	36	17	36	17	These are the sons of Esau’s son Reuel: chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They are the chiefs descended from Reuel in the land of Edom, and they are the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
1059	1	36	18	36	18	These are the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; they are the chiefs descended from Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
1060	1	36	19	36	19	All these are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and they were their chiefs.
1061	1	36	20	36	20	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
1062	1	36	21	36	21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; they are the chiefs of the Horites, the descendants of Seir in the land of Edom.
1063	1	36	22	36	22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Timna was Lotan’s sister.
1064	1	36	23	36	23	These are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
1065	1	36	24	36	24	These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.)
1066	1	36	25	36	25	These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
1067	1	36	26	36	26	These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
1068	1	36	27	36	27	These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
1069	1	36	28	36	28	These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
1070	1	36	29	36	29	These are the chiefs of the Horites: chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
1071	1	36	30	36	30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; they are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their divisions in the land of Seir.
1072	1	36	31	36	31	These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites:
1073	1	36	32	36	32	Bela son of Beor ruled in Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1074	1	36	33	36	33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.
1075	1	36	34	36	34	When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
1076	1	36	35	36	35	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith.
1077	1	36	36	36	36	When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.
1078	1	36	37	36	37	When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place.
1079	1	36	38	36	38	When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned in his place.
1080	1	36	39	36	39	When Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadad reigned in his place. His city was named Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.
1081	1	36	40	36	40	These are the names of Esau’s chiefs, according to their families and regions, by their names: chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
1082	1	36	41	36	41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
1083	1	36	42	36	42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
1084	1	36	43	36	43	Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they possessed. Esau was the father of the Edomites.
1085	1	37	1	37	1	Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had resided, the land of Canaan.
1086	1	37	2	37	2	This is the account of Jacob. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he was tending the flock with his brothers, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
1087	1	37	3	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons, because Joseph had been born to him in his old age; so he made him a robe of many colors.
1088	1	37	4	37	4	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
1089	1	37	5	37	5	Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
1090	1	37	6	37	6	He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
1091	1	37	7	37	7	We were binding sheaves of grain in the field, and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to mine.”
1092	1	37	8	37	8	“Do you intend to reign over us?” his brothers asked. “Will you actually rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and his statements.
1093	1	37	9	37	9	Then Joseph had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
1094	1	37	10	37	10	He told his father and brothers, but his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream that you have had? Will your mother and brothers and I actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
1095	1	37	11	37	11	And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what he had said.
1096	1	37	12	37	12	Some time later, Joseph’s brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks near Shechem.
1097	1	37	13	37	13	Israel said to him, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem? Get ready; I am sending you to them.” “I am ready,” Joseph replied.
1098	1	37	14	37	14	Then Israel told him, “Go now and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. And when Joseph arrived in Shechem,
1099	1	37	15	37	15	a man found him wandering in the field and asked, “What are you looking for?”
1100	1	37	16	37	16	“I am looking for my brothers,” Joseph replied. “Can you please tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?”
1101	1	37	17	37	17	“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
1102	1	37	18	37	18	Now Joseph’s brothers saw him in the distance, and before he arrived, they plotted to kill him.
1103	1	37	19	37	19	“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to one another.
1104	1	37	20	37	20	“Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal has devoured him. Then we shall see what becomes of his dreams!”
1105	1	37	21	37	21	When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue Joseph from their hands. “Let us not take his life,” he said.
1106	1	37	22	37	22	“Do not shed his blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this so that he could rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father.
1107	1	37	23	37	23	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the robe of many colors he was wearing—
1108	1	37	24	37	24	and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, with no water in it.
1109	1	37	25	37	25	And as they sat down to eat a meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh on their way down to Egypt.
1110	1	37	26	37	26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
1111	1	37	27	37	27	Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him; for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And they agreed.
1112	1	37	28	37	28	So when the Midianite traders passed by, his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
1113	1	37	29	37	29	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes,
1114	1	37	30	37	30	returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”
1115	1	37	31	37	31	Then they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.
1116	1	37	32	37	32	They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe or not.”
1117	1	37	33	37	33	His father recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”
1118	1	37	34	37	34	Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days.
1119	1	37	35	37	35	All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said. “I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him.
1120	1	37	36	37	36	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.
1121	1	38	1	38	1	About that time, Judah left his brothers and settled near a man named Hirah, an Adullamite.
1122	1	38	2	38	2	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and he took her as a wife and slept with her.
1123	1	38	3	38	3	So she conceived and gave birth to a son, and Judah named him Er.
1124	1	38	4	38	4	Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan.
1125	1	38	5	38	5	Then she gave birth to another son and named him Shelah; it was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.
1126	1	38	6	38	6	Now Judah acquired a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
1127	1	38	7	38	7	But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the LORD’s sight; so the LORD put him to death.
1128	1	38	8	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law and raise up offspring for your brother.”
1129	1	38	9	38	9	But Onan knew that the offspring would not belong to him; so whenever he would sleep with his brother’s wife, he would spill his seed on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother.
1130	1	38	10	38	10	What he did was evil in the sight of the LORD, so He put Onan to death as well.
1131	1	38	11	38	11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house.
1132	1	38	12	38	12	After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah.
1133	1	38	13	38	13	When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,”
1134	1	38	14	38	14	she removed her widow’s garments, covered her face with a veil to disguise herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that although Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife.
1135	1	38	15	38	15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.
1136	1	38	16	38	16	Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “What will you give me for sleeping with you?” she asked.
1137	1	38	17	38	17	“I will send you a young goat from my flock,” Judah answered. But she replied, “Only if you leave me something as a pledge until you send it.”
1138	1	38	18	38	18	“What pledge should I give you?” he asked. She answered, “Your seal and your cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
1139	1	38	19	38	19	Then Tamar got up and departed. And she removed her veil and put on her widow’s garments again.
1140	1	38	20	38	20	Now when Judah sent his friend Hirah the Adullamite with the young goat to collect the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her.
1141	1	38	21	38	21	He asked the men of that place, “Where is the temple prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?” “No temple prostitute has been here,” they answered.
1142	1	38	22	38	22	So Hirah returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her, and furthermore, the men of that place said, ‘No temple prostitute has been here.’”
1143	1	38	23	38	23	“Let her keep the items,” Judah replied. “Otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you could not find her.”
1144	1	38	24	38	24	About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and now she is pregnant.” “Bring her out!” Judah replied. “Let her be burned to death!”
1145	1	38	25	38	25	As she was being brought out, Tamar sent a message to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Please examine them. Whose seal and cord and staff are these?”
1146	1	38	26	38	26	Judah recognized the items and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again.
1147	1	38	27	38	27	When the time came for Tamar to give birth, there were twins in her womb.
1148	1	38	28	38	28	And as she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist. “This one came out first,” she announced.
1149	1	38	29	38	29	But when he pulled his hand back and his brother came out, she said, “You have broken out first!” So he was named Perez.
1150	1	38	30	38	30	Then his brother came out with the scarlet thread around his wrist, and he was named Zerah.
1151	1	39	1	39	1	Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
1152	1	39	2	39	2	And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master.
1153	1	39	3	39	3	When his master saw that the LORD was with him and made him prosper in all he did,
1154	1	39	4	39	4	Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with everything he owned.
1155	1	39	5	39	5	From the time that he put Joseph in charge of his household and all he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s household on account of him. The LORD’s blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his field.
1156	1	39	6	39	6	So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s care; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
1157	1	39	7	39	7	and after some time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Sleep with me.”
1158	1	39	8	39	8	But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care.
1159	1	39	9	39	9	No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?”
1160	1	39	10	39	10	Although Potiphar’s wife spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be near her.
1161	1	39	11	39	11	One day, however, Joseph went into the house to attend to his work, and not a single household servant was inside.
1162	1	39	12	39	12	She grabbed Joseph by his cloak and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his cloak in her hand, he escaped and ran outside.
1163	1	39	13	39	13	When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
1164	1	39	14	39	14	she called her household servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, but I screamed as loud as I could.
1165	1	39	15	39	15	When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
1166	1	39	16	39	16	So Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s cloak beside her until his master came home.
1167	1	39	17	39	17	Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me,
1168	1	39	18	39	18	but when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
1169	1	39	19	39	19	When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” he burned with anger.
1170	1	39	20	39	20	So Joseph’s master took him and had him thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were confined. While Joseph was there in the prison,
1171	1	39	21	39	21	the LORD was with him and extended kindness to him. He granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden,
1172	1	39	22	39	22	who put all those held in the prison under Joseph’s authority, so that he was responsible for all that was done there.
1173	1	39	23	39	23	The warden did not concern himself with anything under Joseph’s authority, because the LORD was with him and gave him success in whatever he did.
1174	1	40	1	40	1	Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
1175	1	40	2	40	2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
1176	1	40	3	40	3	and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined.
1177	1	40	4	40	4	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. After they had been in custody for some time,
1178	1	40	5	40	5	both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.
1179	1	40	6	40	6	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught.
1180	1	40	7	40	7	So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?”
1181	1	40	8	40	8	“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”
1182	1	40	9	40	9	So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me,
1183	1	40	10	40	10	and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.
1184	1	40	11	40	11	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”
1185	1	40	12	40	12	Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.
1186	1	40	13	40	13	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.
1187	1	40	14	40	14	But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison.
1188	1	40	15	40	15	For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”
1189	1	40	16	40	16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.
1190	1	40	17	40	17	In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
1191	1	40	18	40	18	Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
1192	1	40	19	40	19	Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”
1193	1	40	20	40	20	On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
1194	1	40	21	40	21	Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.
1195	1	40	22	40	22	But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation.
1196	1	40	23	40	23	The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him.
1197	1	41	1	41	1	After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile,
1198	1	41	2	41	2	when seven cows, sleek and well-fed, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.
1199	1	41	3	41	3	After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside the well-fed cows on the bank of the river.
1200	1	41	4	41	4	And the cows that were sickly and thin devoured the seven sleek, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up,
1201	1	41	5	41	5	but he fell back asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk.
1202	1	41	6	41	6	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind.
1203	1	41	7	41	7	And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and realized it was a dream.
1204	1	41	8	41	8	In the morning his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
1205	1	41	9	41	9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures.
1206	1	41	10	41	10	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard.
1207	1	41	11	41	11	One night both the chief baker and I had dreams, and each dream had its own meaning.
1208	1	41	12	41	12	Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us individually.
1209	1	41	13	41	13	And it happened to us just as he had interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.”
1210	1	41	14	41	14	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh.
1211	1	41	15	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
1212	1	41	16	41	16	“I myself cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.”
1213	1	41	17	41	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
1214	1	41	18	41	18	when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.
1215	1	41	19	41	19	After them, seven other cows, sickly, ugly, and thin, came up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!
1216	1	41	20	41	20	Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first.
1217	1	41	21	41	21	When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke.
1218	1	41	22	41	22	In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk.
1219	1	41	23	41	23	After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind.
1220	1	41	24	41	24	And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones. I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me.”
1221	1	41	25	41	25	At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
1222	1	41	26	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same meaning.
1223	1	41	27	41	27	Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind—they are seven years of famine.
1224	1	41	28	41	28	It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
1225	1	41	29	41	29	Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
1226	1	41	30	41	30	but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land.
1227	1	41	31	41	31	The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it will be so severe.
1228	1	41	32	41	32	Moreover, because the dream was given to Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He will carry it out shortly.
1229	1	41	33	41	33	Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
1230	1	41	34	41	34	Let Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
1231	1	41	35	41	35	Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be preserved as food in the cities.
1232	1	41	36	41	36	This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt. Then the country will not perish in the famine.”
1233	1	41	37	41	37	This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his officials.
1234	1	41	38	41	38	So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, in whom the Spirit of God abides?”
1235	1	41	39	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.
1236	1	41	40	41	40	You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people are to obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”
1237	1	41	41	41	41	Pharaoh also told Joseph, “I hereby place you over all the land of Egypt.”
1238	1	41	42	41	42	Then Pharaoh removed the signet ring from his finger, put it on Joseph’s finger, clothed him in garments of fine linen, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
1239	1	41	43	41	43	He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, with men calling out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
1240	1	41	44	41	44	And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.”
1241	1	41	45	41	45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt.
1242	1	41	46	41	46	Now Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.
1243	1	41	47	41	47	During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully.
1244	1	41	48	41	48	During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around it.
1245	1	41	49	41	49	So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure.
1246	1	41	50	41	50	Before the years of famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1247	1	41	51	41	51	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.”
1248	1	41	52	41	52	And the second son he named Ephraim, saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
1249	1	41	53	41	53	When the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,
1250	1	41	54	41	54	the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. And although there was famine in every country, there was food throughout the land of Egypt.
1251	1	41	55	41	55	When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”
1252	1	41	56	41	56	When the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
1253	1	41	57	41	57	And every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.
1254	1	42	1	42	1	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?”
1255	1	42	2	42	2	“Look,” he added, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”
1256	1	42	3	42	3	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
1257	1	42	4	42	4	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm might befall him.”
1258	1	42	5	42	5	So the sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan.
1259	1	42	6	42	6	Now Joseph was the ruler of the land; he was the one who sold grain to all its people. So when his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
1260	1	42	7	42	7	And when Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where have you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We are here to buy food.”
1261	1	42	8	42	8	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
1262	1	42	9	42	9	Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said, “You are spies! You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
1263	1	42	10	42	10	“Not so, my lord,” they replied. “Your servants have come to buy food.
1264	1	42	11	42	11	We are all sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”
1265	1	42	12	42	12	“No,” he told them. “You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
1266	1	42	13	42	13	But they answered, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”
1267	1	42	14	42	14	Then Joseph declared, “Just as I said, you are spies!
1268	1	42	15	42	15	And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
1269	1	42	16	42	16	Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be confined so that the truth of your words may be tested. If they are untrue, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”
1270	1	42	17	42	17	So Joseph imprisoned them for three days,
1271	1	42	18	42	18	and on the third day he said to them, “I fear God. So do this and you will live:
1272	1	42	19	42	19	If you are honest, leave one of your brothers in custody while the rest of you go and take back grain to relieve the hunger of your households.
1273	1	42	20	42	20	Then bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be verified, that you may not die.” And to this they consented.
1274	1	42	21	42	21	Then they said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”
1275	1	42	22	42	22	But Reuben replied: “Didn’t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you would not listen. Now we must account for his blood!”
1276	1	42	23	42	23	They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them.
1277	1	42	24	42	24	And he turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.
1278	1	42	25	42	25	Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s silver to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out,
1279	1	42	26	42	26	and they loaded the grain on their donkeys and departed.
1280	1	42	27	42	27	At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack.
1281	1	42	28	42	28	“My silver has been returned!” he said to his brothers. “It is here in my sack.” Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
1282	1	42	29	42	29	When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they described to him all that had happened to them:
1283	1	42	30	42	30	“The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
1284	1	42	31	42	31	But we told him, ‘We are honest men, not spies.
1285	1	42	32	42	32	We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’
1286	1	42	33	42	33	Then the man who is the lord of the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go.
1287	1	42	34	42	34	But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.’”
1288	1	42	35	42	35	As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver! And when they and their father saw the bags of silver, they were dismayed.
1289	1	42	36	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is no more. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is happening against me!”
1290	1	42	37	42	37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him.”
1291	1	42	38	42	38	But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If any harm comes to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”
1292	1	43	1	43	1	Now the famine was still severe in the land.
1293	1	43	2	43	2	So when Jacob’s sons had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
1294	1	43	3	43	3	But Judah replied, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’
1295	1	43	4	43	4	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
1296	1	43	5	43	5	But if you will not send him, we will not go; for the man told us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.’”
1297	1	43	6	43	6	“Why did you bring this trouble upon me?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man you had another brother?”
1298	1	43	7	43	7	They replied, “The man questioned us in detail about ourselves and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”
1299	1	43	8	43	8	And Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that we may live and not die—neither we, nor you, nor our children.
1300	1	43	9	43	9	I will guarantee his safety. You may hold me personally responsible. If I do not bring him back and set him before you, then may I bear the guilt before you all my life.
1301	1	43	10	43	10	If we had not delayed, we could have come and gone twice by now.”
1302	1	43	11	43	11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and carry them down as a gift for the man—a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds.
1303	1	43	12	43	12	Take double the silver with you so that you may return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
1304	1	43	13	43	13	Take your brother as well, and return to the man at once.
1305	1	43	14	43	14	May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother along with Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”
1306	1	43	15	43	15	So the men took these gifts, along with double the amount of silver, and Benjamin as well. They made their way down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
1307	1	43	16	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with his brothers, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they shall dine with me at noon.”
1308	1	43	17	43	17	The man did as Joseph had commanded and took the brothers to Joseph’s house.
1309	1	43	18	43	18	But the brothers were frightened that they had been taken to Joseph’s house. “We have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time,” they said. “They intend to overpower us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”
1310	1	43	19	43	19	So they approached Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
1311	1	43	20	43	20	“Please, sir,” they said, “we really did come down here the first time to buy food.
1312	1	43	21	43	21	But when we came to the place we lodged for the night, we opened our sacks and, behold, each of us found his silver in the mouth of his sack! It was the full amount of our silver, and we have brought it back with us.
1313	1	43	22	43	22	We have brought additional silver with us to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.”
1314	1	43	23	43	23	“It is fine,” said the steward. “Do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks. I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
1315	1	43	24	43	24	And the steward took the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided food for their donkeys.
1316	1	43	25	43	25	Since the brothers had been told that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon.
1317	1	43	26	43	26	When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought, and they bowed to the ground before him.
1318	1	43	27	43	27	He asked if they were well, and then he asked, “How is your elderly father you told me about? Is he still alive?”
1319	1	43	28	43	28	“Your servant our father is well,” they answered. “He is still alive.” And they bowed down to honor him.
1320	1	43	29	43	29	When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Then he declared, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”
1321	1	43	30	43	30	Joseph hurried out because he was moved to tears for his brother, and he went to a private room to weep.
1322	1	43	31	43	31	Then he washed his face and came back out. Regaining his composure, he said, “Serve the meal.”
1323	1	43	32	43	32	They served Joseph’s brothers separately from him and the Egyptians who ate with him, because Egyptians would not eat with Hebrews, since that was detestable to them.
1324	1	43	33	43	33	They were seated before him in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest, and the men looked at each other in astonishment.
1325	1	43	34	43	34	When the portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of the others. So they feasted and drank freely with Joseph.
1326	1	44	1	44	1	Then Joseph instructed his steward: “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each one’s silver in the mouth of his sack.
1327	1	44	2	44	2	Put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for his grain.” So the steward did as Joseph had instructed.
1328	1	44	3	44	3	At daybreak, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
1329	1	44	4	44	4	They had not gone far from the city when Joseph told his steward, “Pursue the men at once, and when you overtake them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?
1330	1	44	5	44	5	Is this not the cup that my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wicked!’”
1331	1	44	6	44	6	When the steward overtook them, he relayed these words to them.
1332	1	44	7	44	7	“Why does my lord say these things?” they asked. “Your servants could not possibly do such a thing.
1333	1	44	8	44	8	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?
1334	1	44	9	44	9	If any of your servants is found to have it, he must die, and the rest will become slaves of my lord.”
1335	1	44	10	44	10	“As you say,” replied the steward. “But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave, and the rest of you shall be free of blame.”
1336	1	44	11	44	11	So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
1337	1	44	12	44	12	The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest—and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
1338	1	44	13	44	13	Then they all tore their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.
1339	1	44	14	44	14	When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.
1340	1	44	15	44	15	“What is this deed you have done?” Joseph declared. “Do you not know that a man like me can surely divine the truth?”
1341	1	44	16	44	16	“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord’s slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup.”
1342	1	44	17	44	17	But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may return to your father in peace.”
1343	1	44	18	44	18	Then Judah approached Joseph and said, “Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, for you are an equal to Pharaoh.
1344	1	44	19	44	19	My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’
1345	1	44	20	44	20	And we answered, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy’s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and his father loves him.’
1346	1	44	21	44	21	Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can see him for myself.’
1347	1	44	22	44	22	So we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’
1348	1	44	23	44	23	But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your younger brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.’
1349	1	44	24	44	24	Now when we returned to your servant my father, we relayed your words to him.
1350	1	44	25	44	25	Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy us some food.’
1351	1	44	26	44	26	But we answered, ‘We cannot go down there unless our younger brother goes with us. So if our younger brother is not with us, we cannot see the man.’
1352	1	44	27	44	27	And your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.
1353	1	44	28	44	28	When one of them was gone, I said: “Surely he has been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen him since.
1354	1	44	29	44	29	So if you take this one from me as well and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’
1355	1	44	30	44	30	So if the boy is not with us when I return to your servant, and if my father, whose life is wrapped up in the boy’s life,
1356	1	44	31	44	31	sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow.
1357	1	44	32	44	32	Indeed, your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father, saying, ‘If I do not return him to you, I will bear the guilt before you, my father, all my life.’
1358	1	44	33	44	33	Now please let your servant stay here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy. Let him return with his brothers.
1359	1	44	34	44	34	For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the misery that would overwhelm him.”
1360	1	45	1	45	1	Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, “Send everyone away from me!” So none of them were with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
1361	1	45	2	45	2	But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians and Pharaoh’s household heard him.
1362	1	45	3	45	3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But they were unable to answer him, because they were terrified in his presence.
1363	1	45	4	45	4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near me.” And they did so. “I am Joseph, your brother,” he said, “the one you sold into Egypt!
1364	1	45	5	45	5	And now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves that you sold me into this place, because it was to save lives that God sent me before you.
1365	1	45	6	45	6	For the famine has covered the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting.
1366	1	45	7	45	7	God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
1367	1	45	8	45	8	Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God, who has made me a father to Pharaoh—lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
1368	1	45	9	45	9	Now return quickly to my father and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay.
1369	1	45	10	45	10	You shall settle in the land of Goshen and be near me—you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own.
1370	1	45	11	45	11	And there I will provide for you, because there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you and your household and everything you own will come to destitution.’
1371	1	45	12	45	12	Behold! You and my brother Benjamin can see that I, Joseph, am the one speaking with you.
1372	1	45	13	45	13	Tell my father about all my splendor in Egypt and everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.”
1373	1	45	14	45	14	Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept as they embraced.
1374	1	45	15	45	15	Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept over them. And afterward his brothers talked with him.
1375	1	45	16	45	16	When the news reached Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, Pharaoh and his servants were pleased.
1376	1	45	17	45	17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do as follows: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan.
1377	1	45	18	45	18	Then bring your father and your families and return to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat from the fat of the land.’
1378	1	45	19	45	19	You are also directed to tell them: ‘Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your young children and your wives, and bring your father and come back.
1379	1	45	20	45	20	But pay no regard to your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”
1380	1	45	21	45	21	So the sons of Israel did as they were told. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
1381	1	45	22	45	22	He gave new garments to each of them, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
1382	1	45	23	45	23	And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions for his father’s journey.
1383	1	45	24	45	24	Then Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way!”
1384	1	45	25	45	25	So the brothers went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
1385	1	45	26	45	26	“Joseph is still alive,” they said, “and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” But Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them.
1386	1	45	27	45	27	However, when they relayed all that Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob was revived.
1387	1	45	28	45	28	“Enough!” declared Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I will go to see him before I die.”
1388	1	46	1	46	1	So Israel set out with all that he had, and when he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
1389	1	46	2	46	2	And that night God spoke to Israel in a vision: “Jacob, Jacob!” He said. “Here I am,” replied Jacob.
1390	1	46	3	46	3	“I am God,” He said, “the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.
1391	1	46	4	46	4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you back. And Joseph’s own hands will close your eyes.”
1392	1	46	5	46	5	Then Jacob departed from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him, along with their children and wives.
1393	1	46	6	46	6	They also took the livestock and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt.
1394	1	46	7	46	7	Jacob took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons, and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring.
1395	1	46	8	46	8	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
1396	1	46	9	46	9	The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
1397	1	46	10	46	10	The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
1398	1	46	11	46	11	The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1399	1	46	12	46	12	The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez: Hezron and Hamul.
1400	1	46	13	46	13	The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron.
1401	1	46	14	46	14	The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
1402	1	46	15	46	15	These are the sons of Leah born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, in addition to his daughter Dinah. The total number of sons and daughters was thirty-three.
1403	1	46	16	46	16	The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
1404	1	46	17	46	17	The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah. And their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
1405	1	46	18	46	18	These are the sons of Jacob born to Zilpah—whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all.
1406	1	46	19	46	19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
1407	1	46	20	46	20	Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
1408	1	46	21	46	21	The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
1409	1	46	22	46	22	These are the sons of Rachel born to Jacob—fourteen in all.
1410	1	46	23	46	23	The son of Dan: Hushim.
1411	1	46	24	46	24	The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
1412	1	46	25	46	25	These are the sons of Jacob born to Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel—seven in all.
1413	1	46	26	46	26	All those belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt—his direct descendants, besides the wives of Jacob’s sons—numbered sixty-six persons.
1414	1	46	27	46	27	And with the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob’s family who went to Egypt were seventy in all.
1415	1	46	28	46	28	Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When Jacob’s family arrived in the land of Goshen,
1416	1	46	29	46	29	Joseph prepared his chariot and went there to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, embraced him, and wept profusely.
1417	1	46	30	46	30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Finally I can die, now that I have seen your face and know that you are still alive!”
1418	1	46	31	46	31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and inform Pharaoh: ‘My brothers and my father’s household from the land of Canaan have come to me.
1419	1	46	32	46	32	The men are shepherds; they raise livestock, and they have brought their flocks and herds and all that they own.’
1420	1	46	33	46	33	When Pharaoh summons you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’
1421	1	46	34	46	34	you are to say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock ever since our youth—both we and our fathers.’ Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen, since all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.”
1422	1	47	1	47	1	So Joseph went and told Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”
1423	1	47	2	47	2	And he chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
1424	1	47	3	47	3	“What is your occupation?” Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers. “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied, “both we and our fathers.”
1425	1	47	4	47	4	Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land for a time, because there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.”
1426	1	47	5	47	5	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you,
1427	1	47	6	47	6	the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any talented men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.”
1428	1	47	7	47	7	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
1429	1	47	8	47	8	“How many years have you lived?” Pharaoh asked.
1430	1	47	9	47	9	“My travels have lasted 130 years,” Jacob replied. “My years have been few and hard, and they have not matched the years of the travels of my fathers.”
1431	1	47	10	47	10	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from his presence.
1432	1	47	11	47	11	So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
1433	1	47	12	47	12	Joseph also provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household with food for their families.
1434	1	47	13	47	13	Yet there was no food throughout that region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine.
1435	1	47	14	47	14	Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into Pharaoh’s palace.
1436	1	47	15	47	15	When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!”
1437	1	47	16	47	16	“Then bring me your livestock,” said Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.”
1438	1	47	17	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
1439	1	47	18	47	18	When that year was over, they came to him the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
1440	1	47	19	47	19	Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Purchase us and our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”
1441	1	47	20	47	20	So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s,
1442	1	47	21	47	21	and Joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of Egypt to the other.
1443	1	47	22	47	22	However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land.
1444	1	47	23	47	23	Then Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is seed for you to sow in the land.
1445	1	47	24	47	24	At harvest time, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and food for yourselves and your households and children.”
1446	1	47	25	47	25	“You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favor in our lord’s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
1447	1	47	26	47	26	So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh.
1448	1	47	27	47	27	Now the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and became fruitful and increased greatly in number.
1449	1	47	28	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the length of his life was 147 years.
1450	1	47	29	47	29	When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
1451	1	47	30	47	30	but when I lie down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me with them.” Joseph answered, “I will do as you have requested.”
1452	1	47	31	47	31	“Swear to me,” Jacob said. So Joseph swore to him, and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed.
1453	1	48	1	48	1	Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
1454	1	48	2	48	2	When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed.
1455	1	48	3	48	3	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there He blessed me
1456	1	48	4	48	4	and told me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I will make you a multitude of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’
1457	1	48	5	48	5	And now your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here shall be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
1458	1	48	6	48	6	Any children born to you after them shall be yours, and they shall be called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit.
1459	1	48	7	48	7	Now as for me, when I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).
1460	1	48	8	48	8	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”
1461	1	48	9	48	9	Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me, that I may bless them.”
1462	1	48	10	48	10	Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
1463	1	48	11	48	11	“I never expected to see your face again,” Israel said to Joseph, “but now God has let me see your children as well.”
1464	1	48	12	48	12	Then Joseph removed his sons from his father’s knees and bowed facedown.
1465	1	48	13	48	13	And Joseph took both of them—with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—and brought them close to him.
1466	1	48	14	48	14	But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
1467	1	48	15	48	15	Then he blessed Joseph and said: “May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
1468	1	48	16	48	16	the angel who has redeemed me from all harm—may He bless these boys. And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
1469	1	48	17	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was displeased and took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.
1470	1	48	18	48	18	“Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”
1471	1	48	19	48	19	But his father refused. “I know, my son, I know!” he said. “He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great; nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.”
1472	1	48	20	48	20	So that day Jacob blessed them and said: “By you shall Israel pronounce this blessing: ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
1473	1	48	21	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
1474	1	48	22	48	22	And to you, as one who is above your brothers, I give the ridge of land that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.”
1475	1	49	1	49	1	Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the days to come:
1476	1	49	2	49	2	Come together and listen, O sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.
1477	1	49	3	49	3	Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.
1478	1	49	4	49	4	Uncontrolled as the waters, you will no longer excel, because you went up to your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it.
1479	1	49	5	49	5	Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords are weapons of violence.
1480	1	49	6	49	6	May I never enter their council; may I never join their assembly. For they kill men in their anger, and hamstring oxen on a whim.
1481	1	49	7	49	7	Cursed be their anger, for it is strong, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will disperse them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
1482	1	49	8	49	8	Judah, your brothers shall praise you. Your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; your father’s sons shall bow down to you.
1483	1	49	9	49	9	Judah is a young lion—my son, you return from the prey. Like a lion he crouches and lies down; like a lioness, who dares to rouse him?
1484	1	49	10	49	10	The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes and the allegiance of the nations is his.
1485	1	49	11	49	11	He ties his donkey to the vine, his colt to the choicest branch. He washes his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
1486	1	49	12	49	12	His eyes are darker than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.
1487	1	49	13	49	13	Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore and become a harbor for ships; his border shall extend to Sidon.
1488	1	49	14	49	14	Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds.
1489	1	49	15	49	15	He saw that his resting place was good and that his land was pleasant, so he bent his shoulder to the burden and submitted to labor as a servant.
1490	1	49	16	49	16	Dan shall provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
1491	1	49	17	49	17	He will be a snake by the road, a viper in the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider tumbles backward.
1492	1	49	18	49	18	I await Your salvation, O LORD.
1493	1	49	19	49	19	Gad will be attacked by raiders, but he will attack their heels.
1494	1	49	20	49	20	Asher’s food will be rich; he shall provide royal delicacies.
1495	1	49	21	49	21	Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
1496	1	49	22	49	22	Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a spring, whose branches scale the wall.
1497	1	49	23	49	23	The archers attacked him with bitterness, and aimed in hostility.
1498	1	49	24	49	24	Yet he steadied his bow, and his strong arms were tempered by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, in the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
1499	1	49	25	49	25	by the God of your father who helps you, and by the Almighty who blesses you, with blessings of the heavens above, with blessings of the depths below, with blessings of the breasts and womb.
1500	1	49	26	49	26	The blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills. May they rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
1501	1	49	27	49	27	Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder.”
1502	1	49	28	49	28	These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing.
1503	1	49	29	49	29	Then Jacob instructed them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
1504	1	49	30	49	30	The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
1505	1	49	31	49	31	There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried, and there I buried Leah.
1506	1	49	32	49	32	The field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.”
1507	1	49	33	49	33	When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he pulled his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and he was gathered to his people.
1508	1	50	1	50	1	Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face, wept over him, and kissed him.
1509	1	50	2	50	2	And Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So they embalmed him,
1510	1	50	3	50	3	taking the forty days required to complete the embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
1511	1	50	4	50	4	When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please tell Pharaoh that
1512	1	50	5	50	5	my father made me swear an oath when he said, ‘I am about to die. You must bury me in the tomb that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Now let me go and bury my father, and then return.”
1513	1	50	6	50	6	Pharaoh replied, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”
1514	1	50	7	50	7	Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him—the elders of Pharaoh’s household and all the elders of the land of Egypt—
1515	1	50	8	50	8	along with all of Joseph’s household, and his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children and flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
1516	1	50	9	50	9	Chariots and horsemen alike went up with him, and it was an exceedingly large procession.
1517	1	50	10	50	10	When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wailed loudly, and Joseph mourned for his father seven days.
1518	1	50	11	50	11	When the Canaanites of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn ceremony of mourning by the Egyptians.” Thus the place across the Jordan is called Abel-mizraim.
1519	1	50	12	50	12	So Jacob’s sons did as he had charged them.
1520	1	50	13	50	13	They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
1521	1	50	14	50	14	After Joseph had buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father.
1522	1	50	15	50	15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge? Then he will surely repay us for all the evil that we did to him.”
1523	1	50	16	50	16	So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Before he died, your father commanded,
1524	1	50	17	50	17	‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression and sin of your brothers, for they did you wrong.’ So now, Joseph, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
1525	1	50	18	50	18	His brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said, “We are your slaves!”
1526	1	50	19	50	19	But Joseph replied, “Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
1527	1	50	20	50	20	As for you, what you intended against me for evil, God intended for good, in order to accomplish a day like this—to preserve the lives of many people.
1528	1	50	21	50	21	Therefore do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” So Joseph reassured his brothers and spoke kindly to them.
1529	1	50	22	50	22	Now Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt, and Joseph lived to the age of 110.
1530	1	50	23	50	23	He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation, and indeed the sons of Machir son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph’s knees.
1531	1	50	24	50	24	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
1532	1	50	25	50	25	And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath and said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”
1533	1	50	26	50	26	So Joseph died at the age of 110. And they embalmed his body and placed it in a coffin in Egypt.
1534	2	1	1	1	1	These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
1535	2	1	2	1	2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
1536	2	1	3	1	3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
1537	2	1	4	1	4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
1538	2	1	5	1	5	The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt.
1539	2	1	6	1	6	Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
1540	2	1	7	1	7	but the Israelites were fruitful and increased abundantly; they multiplied and became exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
1541	2	1	8	1	8	Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
1542	2	1	9	1	9	“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.
1543	2	1	10	1	10	Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”
1544	2	1	11	1	11	So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
1545	2	1	12	1	12	But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
1546	2	1	13	1	13	They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
1547	2	1	14	1	14	and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh.
1548	2	1	15	1	15	Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
1549	2	1	16	1	16	“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.”
1550	2	1	17	1	17	The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live.
1551	2	1	18	1	18	So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
1552	2	1	19	1	19	The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.”
1553	2	1	20	1	20	So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous.
1554	2	1	21	1	21	And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.
1555	2	1	22	1	22	Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”
1556	2	2	1	2	1	Now a man of the house of Levi married a daughter of Levi,
1557	2	2	2	2	2	and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.
1558	2	2	3	2	3	But when she could no longer hide him, she got him a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in the basket and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
1559	2	2	4	2	4	And his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
1560	2	2	5	2	5	Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the Nile, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. And when she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maidservant to retrieve it.
1561	2	2	6	2	6	When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the little boy was crying. So she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.”
1562	2	2	7	2	7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?”
1563	2	2	8	2	8	“Go ahead,” Pharaoh’s daughter told her. And the girl went and called the boy’s mother.
1564	2	2	9	2	9	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him.
1565	2	2	10	2	10	When the child had grown older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses and explained, “I drew him out of the water.”
1566	2	2	11	2	11	One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
1567	2	2	12	2	12	After looking this way and that and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
1568	2	2	13	2	13	The next day Moses went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your fellow Hebrew?”
1569	2	2	14	2	14	But the man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “This thing I have done has surely become known.”
1570	2	2	15	2	15	When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down beside a well.
1571	2	2	16	2	16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.
1572	2	2	17	2	17	And when some shepherds came along and drove them away, Moses rose up to help them and watered their flock.
1573	2	2	18	2	18	When the daughters returned to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”
1574	2	2	19	2	19	“An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they replied. “He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
1575	2	2	20	2	20	“So where is he?” their father asked. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”
1576	2	2	21	2	21	Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
1577	2	2	22	2	22	And she gave birth to a son whom he named Gershom, for he said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”
1578	2	2	23	2	23	After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned and cried out under their burden of slavery, and their cry for deliverance from bondage ascended to God.
1579	2	2	24	2	24	So God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
1580	2	2	25	2	25	God saw the Israelites and took notice.
1581	2	3	1	3	1	Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
1582	2	3	2	3	2	There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was not consumed.
1583	2	3	3	3	3	So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burning up?”
1584	2	3	4	3	4	When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!” “Here I am,” he answered.
1585	2	3	5	3	5	“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
1586	2	3	6	3	6	Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
1587	2	3	7	3	7	The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings.
1588	2	3	8	3	8	I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
1589	2	3	9	3	9	And now the cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them.
1590	2	3	10	3	10	Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”
1591	2	3	11	3	11	But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
1592	2	3	12	3	12	“I will surely be with you,” God said, “and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.”
1593	2	3	13	3	13	Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I tell them?”
1594	2	3	14	3	14	God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
1595	2	3	15	3	15	God also told Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
1596	2	3	16	3	16	Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said: I have surely attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
1597	2	3	17	3	17	And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’
1598	2	3	18	3	18	The elders of Israel will listen to what you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’
1599	2	3	19	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him.
1600	2	3	20	3	20	So I will stretch out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will perform among them. And after that, he will release you.
1601	2	3	21	3	21	And I will grant this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away empty-handed.
1602	2	3	22	3	22	Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”
1603	2	4	1	4	1	Then Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’”
1604	2	4	2	4	2	And the LORD asked him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied.
1605	2	4	3	4	3	“Throw it on the ground,” said the Lord. So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
1606	2	4	4	4	4	“Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail,” the LORD said to Moses, who reached out his hand and caught the snake, and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
1607	2	4	5	4	5	“This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.”
1608	2	4	6	4	6	Furthermore, the LORD said to Moses, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, white as snow.
1609	2	4	7	4	7	“Put your hand back inside your cloak,” said the LORD. So Moses put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his skin.
1610	2	4	8	4	8	And the LORD said, “If they refuse to believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe that of the second.
1611	2	4	9	4	9	But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. Then the water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.”
1612	2	4	10	4	10	“Please, Lord,” Moses replied, “I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and tongue.”
1613	2	4	11	4	11	And the LORD said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, the sighted or the blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
1614	2	4	12	4	12	Now go! I will help you as you speak, and I will teach you what to say.”
1615	2	4	13	4	13	But Moses replied, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”
1616	2	4	14	4	14	Then the LORD’s anger burned against Moses, and He said, “Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well, and he is now on his way to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
1617	2	4	15	4	15	You are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth. I will help both of you to speak, and I will teach you what to do.
1618	2	4	16	4	16	He will speak to the people for you. He will be your spokesman, and it will be as if you were God to him.
1619	2	4	17	4	17	But take this staff in your hand so that you can perform signs with it.”
1620	2	4	18	4	18	Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me return to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” “Go in peace,” Jethro replied.
1621	2	4	19	4	19	Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who sought to kill you are dead.”
1622	2	4	20	4	20	So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
1623	2	4	21	4	21	The LORD instructed Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put within your power. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
1624	2	4	22	4	22	Then tell Pharaoh that this is what the LORD says: ‘Israel is My firstborn son,
1625	2	4	23	4	23	and I told you to let My son go so that he may worship Me. But since you have refused to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son!’”
1626	2	4	24	4	24	Now at a lodging place along the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him.
1627	2	4	25	4	25	But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched it to Moses’ feet. “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.
1628	2	4	26	4	26	So the LORD let him alone. (When she said, “bridegroom of blood,” she was referring to the circumcision.)
1629	2	4	27	4	27	Meanwhile, the LORD had said to Aaron, “Go and meet Moses in the wilderness.” So he went and met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
1630	2	4	28	4	28	And Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and all the signs He had commanded him to perform.
1631	2	4	29	4	29	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites,
1632	2	4	30	4	30	and Aaron relayed everything that the LORD had said to Moses. And Moses performed the signs before the people,
1633	2	4	31	4	31	and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD had attended to the Israelites and had seen their affliction, they bowed down and worshiped.
1634	2	5	1	5	1	After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.’”
1635	2	5	2	5	2	But Pharaoh replied, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go.”
1636	2	5	3	5	3	“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”
1637	2	5	4	5	4	But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labor!”
1638	2	5	5	5	5	Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their labor.”
1639	2	5	6	5	6	That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen:
1640	2	5	7	5	7	“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and gather their own straw.
1641	2	5	8	5	8	But require of them the same quota of bricks as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
1642	2	5	9	5	9	Make the work harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to these lies.”
1643	2	5	10	5	10	So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am no longer giving you straw.
1644	2	5	11	5	11	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’”
1645	2	5	12	5	12	So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
1646	2	5	13	5	13	The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.”
1647	2	5	14	5	14	Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?”
1648	2	5	15	5	15	So the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way?
1649	2	5	16	5	16	No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”
1650	2	5	17	5	17	“You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’
1651	2	5	18	5	18	Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”
1652	2	5	19	5	19	The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”
1653	2	5	20	5	20	When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them.
1654	2	5	21	5	21	“May the LORD look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!”
1655	2	5	22	5	22	So Moses returned to the LORD and asked, “Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Is this why You sent me?
1656	2	5	23	5	23	Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and You have not delivered Your people in any way.”
1657	2	6	1	6	1	But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”
1658	2	6	2	6	2	God also told Moses, “I am the LORD.
1659	2	6	3	6	3	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them.
1660	2	6	4	6	4	I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.
1661	2	6	5	6	5	Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.
1662	2	6	6	6	6	Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
1663	2	6	7	6	7	I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
1664	2	6	8	6	8	And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’”
1665	2	6	9	6	9	Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him.
1666	2	6	10	6	10	So the LORD said to Moses,
1667	2	6	11	6	11	“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.”
1668	2	6	12	6	12	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?”
1669	2	6	13	6	13	Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
1670	2	6	14	6	14	These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
1671	2	6	15	6	15	The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
1672	2	6	16	6	16	These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
1673	2	6	17	6	17	The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
1674	2	6	18	6	18	The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
1675	2	6	19	6	19	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites according to their records.
1676	2	6	20	6	20	And Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
1677	2	6	21	6	21	The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
1678	2	6	22	6	22	The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
1679	2	6	23	6	23	And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
1680	2	6	24	6	24	The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the clans of the Korahites.
1681	2	6	25	6	25	Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families by their clans.
1682	2	6	26	6	26	It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.”
1683	2	6	27	6	27	Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
1684	2	6	28	6	28	Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,
1685	2	6	29	6	29	He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.”
1686	2	6	30	6	30	But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”
1687	2	7	1	7	1	The LORD answered Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
1688	2	7	2	7	2	You are to speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron must declare it to Pharaoh so that he will let the Israelites go out of his land.
1689	2	7	3	7	3	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
1690	2	7	4	7	4	Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay My hand on Egypt, and by mighty acts of judgment I will bring the divisions of My people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
1691	2	7	5	7	5	And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.”
1692	2	7	6	7	6	So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded them.
1693	2	7	7	7	7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
1694	2	7	8	7	8	The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
1695	2	7	9	7	9	“When Pharaoh tells you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ you are to say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a serpent.”
1696	2	7	10	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent.
1697	2	7	11	7	11	But Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers and magicians of Egypt, and they also did the same things by their magic arts.
1698	2	7	12	7	12	Each one threw down his staff, and it became a serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up the other staffs.
1699	2	7	13	7	13	Still, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
1700	2	7	14	7	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
1701	2	7	15	7	15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning as you see him walking out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
1702	2	7	16	7	16	Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness. But you have not listened until now.
1703	2	7	17	7	17	This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD. Behold, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will turn to blood.
1704	2	7	18	7	18	The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its water.’”
1705	2	7	19	7	19	And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers and canals and ponds and reservoirs—that they may become blood.’ There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in the vessels of wood and stone.”
1706	2	7	20	7	20	Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded; in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was turned to blood.
1707	2	7	21	7	21	The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. And there was blood throughout the land of Egypt.
1708	2	7	22	7	22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same things by their magic arts. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
1709	2	7	23	7	23	Instead, Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and did not take any of this to heart.
1710	2	7	24	7	24	So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the river.
1711	2	7	25	7	25	And seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
1712	2	7	26	8	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
1713	2	7	27	8	2	But if you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
1714	2	7	28	8	3	The Nile will teem with frogs, and they will come into your palace and up to your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.
1715	2	7	29	8	4	The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’”
1716	2	8	1	8	5	And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers and canals and ponds, and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of Egypt.’”
1717	2	8	2	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
1718	2	8	3	8	7	But the magicians did the same thing by their magic arts, and they also brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt.
1719	2	8	4	8	8	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people. Then I will let your people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD.”
1720	2	8	5	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor over me. When shall I pray for you and your officials and your people that the frogs (except for those in the Nile) may be taken away from you and your houses?”
1721	2	8	6	8	10	“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh answered. “May it be as you say,” Moses replied, “so that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
1722	2	8	7	8	11	The frogs will depart from you and your houses and your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”
1723	2	8	8	8	12	After Moses and Aaron had left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD for help with the frogs that He had brought against Pharaoh.
1724	2	8	9	8	13	And the LORD did as Moses requested, and the frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died.
1725	2	8	10	8	14	They were piled into countless heaps, and there was a terrible stench in the land.
1726	2	8	11	8	15	When Pharaoh saw there was relief, however, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
1727	2	8	12	8	16	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, that it may turn into swarms of gnats throughout the land of Egypt.’”
1728	2	8	13	8	17	This they did, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, gnats came upon man and beast. All the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the land of Egypt.
1729	2	8	14	8	18	The magicians tried to produce gnats using their magic arts, but they could not. And the gnats remained on man and beast.
1730	2	8	15	8	19	“This is the finger of God,” the magicians said to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
1731	2	8	16	8	20	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, and when Pharaoh goes out to the water, stand before him and tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
1732	2	8	17	8	21	But if you will not let My people go, I will send swarms of flies upon you and your officials and your people and your houses. The houses of the Egyptians and even the ground where they stand will be full of flies.
1733	2	8	18	8	22	But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where My people live; no swarms of flies will be found there. In this way you will know that I, the LORD, am in the land.
1734	2	8	19	8	23	I will make a distinction between My people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.’”
1735	2	8	20	8	24	And the LORD did so. Thick swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials. Throughout Egypt the land was ruined by swarms of flies.
1736	2	8	21	8	25	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within this land.”
1737	2	8	22	8	26	But Moses replied, “It would not be right to do that, because the sacrifices we offer to the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are detestable before the Egyptians, will they not stone us?
1738	2	8	23	8	27	We must make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us.”
1739	2	8	24	8	28	Pharaoh answered, “I will let you go and sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”
1740	2	8	25	8	29	“As soon as I leave you,” Moses said, “I will pray to the LORD, so that tomorrow the swarms of flies will depart from Pharaoh and his officials and his people. But Pharaoh must not act deceitfully again by refusing to let the people go and sacrifice to the LORD.”
1741	2	8	26	8	30	Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,
1742	2	8	27	8	31	and the LORD did as Moses requested. He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not one fly remained.
1743	2	8	28	8	32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time as well, and he would not let the people go.
1744	2	9	1	9	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
1745	2	9	2	9	2	But if you continue to restrain them and refuse to let them go,
1746	2	9	3	9	3	then the hand of the LORD will bring a severe plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks.
1747	2	9	4	9	4	But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’”
1748	2	9	5	9	5	The LORD set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.”
1749	2	9	6	9	6	And the next day the LORD did just that. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
1750	2	9	7	9	7	Pharaoh sent officials and found that none of the livestock of the Israelites had died. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the people go.
1751	2	9	8	9	8	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the furnace; in the sight of Pharaoh, Moses is to toss it into the air.
1752	2	9	9	9	9	It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on man and beast throughout the land.”
1753	2	9	10	9	10	So they took soot from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on man and beast.
1754	2	9	11	9	11	The magicians could not stand before Moses, because the boils had broken out on them and on all the Egyptians.
1755	2	9	12	9	12	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had told Moses.
1756	2	9	13	9	13	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
1757	2	9	14	9	14	Otherwise, I will send all My plagues against you and your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
1758	2	9	15	9	15	For by this time I could have stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you off the earth.
1759	2	9	16	9	16	But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power to you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
1760	2	9	17	9	17	Still, you lord it over My people and do not allow them to go.
1761	2	9	18	9	18	Behold, at this time tomorrow I will rain down the worst hail that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded until now.
1762	2	9	19	9	19	So give orders now to shelter your livestock and everything you have in the field. Every man or beast that remains in the field and is not brought inside will die when the hail comes down upon them.’”
1763	2	9	20	9	20	Those among Pharaoh’s officials who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their servants and livestock to shelter,
1764	2	9	21	9	21	but those who disregarded the word of the LORD left their servants and livestock in the field.
1765	2	9	22	9	22	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt—on man and beast and every plant of the field throughout the land of Egypt.”
1766	2	9	23	9	23	So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the earth. So the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
1767	2	9	24	9	24	The hail fell and the lightning continued flashing through it. The hail was so severe that nothing like it had ever been seen in all the land of Egypt from the time it became a nation.
1768	2	9	25	9	25	Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything in the field, both man and beast; it beat down every plant of the field and stripped every tree.
1769	2	9	26	9	26	The only place where it did not hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived.
1770	2	9	27	9	27	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said. “The LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
1771	2	9	28	9	28	Pray to the LORD, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you do not need to stay any longer.”
1772	2	9	29	9	29	Moses said to him, “When I have left the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD’s.
1773	2	9	30	9	30	But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear the LORD our God.”
1774	2	9	31	9	31	(Now the flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley was ripe and the flax was in bloom;
1775	2	9	32	9	32	but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed, because they are late crops.)
1776	2	9	33	9	33	Then Moses departed from Pharaoh, went out of the city, and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder and hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
1777	2	9	34	9	34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart—he and his officials.
1778	2	9	35	9	35	So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.
1779	2	10	1	10	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials, that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them,
1780	2	10	2	10	2	and that you may tell your children and grandchildren how severely I dealt with the Egyptians when I performed miraculous signs among them, so that all of you may know that I am the LORD.”
1781	2	10	3	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
1782	2	10	4	10	4	But if you refuse to let My people go, I will bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.
1783	2	10	5	10	5	They will cover the face of the land so that no one can see it. They will devour whatever is left after the hail and eat every tree that grows in your fields.
1784	2	10	6	10	6	They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and every Egyptian—something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they came into this land.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.
1785	2	10	7	10	7	Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is in ruins?”
1786	2	10	8	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But who exactly will be going?”
1787	2	10	9	10	9	“We will go with our young and old,” Moses replied. “We will go with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”
1788	2	10	10	10	10	Then Pharaoh told them, “May the LORD be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones. Clearly you are bent on evil.
1789	2	10	11	10	11	No, only the men may go and worship the LORD, since that is what you have been requesting.” And Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh’s presence.
1790	2	10	12	10	12	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, so that the locusts may swarm over it and devour every plant in the land—everything that the hail has left behind.”
1791	2	10	13	10	13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land. By morning the east wind had brought the locusts.
1792	2	10	14	10	14	The locusts swarmed across the land and settled over the entire territory of Egypt. Never before had there been so many locusts, and never again will there be.
1793	2	10	15	10	15	They covered the face of all the land until it was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
1794	2	10	16	10	16	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
1795	2	10	17	10	17	Now please forgive my sin once more and appeal to the LORD your God, that He may remove this death from me.”
1796	2	10	18	10	18	So Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD.
1797	2	10	19	10	19	And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind that carried off the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt.
1798	2	10	20	10	20	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
1799	2	10	21	10	21	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that darkness may spread over the land of Egypt—a palpable darkness.”
1800	2	10	22	10	22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and total darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days.
1801	2	10	23	10	23	No one could see each other, and for three days no one left his place. Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings.
1802	2	10	24	10	24	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your little ones may go with you; only your flocks and herds must stay behind.”
1803	2	10	25	10	25	But Moses replied, “You must also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
1804	2	10	26	10	26	Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God, and we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive.”
1805	2	10	27	10	27	But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
1806	2	10	28	10	28	“Depart from me!” Pharaoh said to Moses. “Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”
1807	2	10	29	10	29	“As you say,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.”
1808	2	11	1	11	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague. After that, he will allow you to leave this place. And when he lets you go, he will drive you out completely.
1809	2	11	2	11	2	Now announce to the people that men and women alike should ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.”
1810	2	11	3	11	3	And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.
1811	2	11	4	11	4	So Moses declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt,
1812	2	11	5	11	5	and every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl behind the hand mill, as well as the firstborn of all the cattle.
1813	2	11	6	11	6	Then a great cry will go out over all the land of Egypt, the likes of which have never been heard before and will never be heard again.
1814	2	11	7	11	7	But among all the Israelites, not even a dog will snarl at man or beast.’ Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
1815	2	11	8	11	8	All these officials of yours will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that, I will depart.” And hot with anger, Moses left Pharaoh’s presence.
1816	2	11	9	11	9	The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
1817	2	11	10	11	10	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart so that he would not let the Israelites go out of his land.
1818	2	12	1	12	1	Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
1819	2	12	2	12	2	“This month is the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first month of your year.
1820	2	12	3	12	3	Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must select a lamb for his family, one per household.
1821	2	12	4	12	4	If the household is too small for a whole lamb, they are to share with the nearest neighbor based on the number of people, and apportion the lamb accordingly.
1822	2	12	5	12	5	Your lamb must be an unblemished year-old male, and you may take it from the sheep or the goats.
1823	2	12	6	12	6	You must keep it until the fourteenth day of the month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight.
1824	2	12	7	12	7	They are to take some of the blood and put it on the two side posts and tops of the doorframes of the houses in which they eat the lambs.
1825	2	12	8	12	8	They are to eat the meat that night, roasted over the fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
1826	2	12	9	12	9	Do not eat any of the meat raw or cooked in boiling water, but only roasted over the fire—its head and legs and inner parts.
1827	2	12	10	12	10	Do not leave any of it until morning; before the morning you must burn up any part that is left over.
1828	2	12	11	12	11	This is how you are to eat it: You must be fully dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. You are to eat in haste; it is the LORD’s Passover.
1829	2	12	12	12	12	On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast, and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.
1830	2	12	13	12	13	The blood on the houses where you are staying will distinguish them; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will fall on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
1831	2	12	14	12	14	And this day will be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD, as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
1832	2	12	15	12	15	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you are to remove the leaven from your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
1833	2	12	16	12	16	On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly, and another on the seventh day. You must not do any work on those days, except to prepare the meals—that is all you may do.
1834	2	12	17	12	17	So you are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land of Egypt. You must keep this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
1835	2	12	18	12	18	In the first month you are to eat unleavened bread, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
1836	2	12	19	12	19	For seven days there must be no leaven found in your houses. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a foreigner or native of the land, must be cut off from the congregation of Israel.
1837	2	12	20	12	20	You are not to eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.”
1838	2	12	21	12	21	Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and told them, “Go at once and select for yourselves a lamb for each family, and slaughter the Passover lamb.
1839	2	12	22	12	22	Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and brush the top and the two side posts of the doorframe with some of the blood. None of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning.
1840	2	12	23	12	23	When the LORD passes through to strike down the Egyptians, He will see the blood on the top and the two side posts and pass over the door; so He will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
1841	2	12	24	12	24	And you are to keep this command as a perpetual ordinance for you and your descendants.
1842	2	12	25	12	25	When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to keep this service.
1843	2	12	26	12	26	When your children ask you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’
1844	2	12	27	12	27	you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck down the Egyptians and spared our homes.’” Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
1845	2	12	28	12	28	And the Israelites went and did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
1846	2	12	29	12	29	Now at midnight the LORD struck down every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the dungeon, as well as all the firstborn among the livestock.
1847	2	12	30	12	30	During the night Pharaoh got up—he and all his officials and all the Egyptians—and there was loud wailing in Egypt; for there was no house without someone dead.
1848	2	12	31	12	31	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.
1849	2	12	32	12	32	Take your flocks and herds as well, just as you have said, and depart! And bless me also.”
1850	2	12	33	12	33	And in order to send them out of the land quickly, the Egyptians urged the people on. “For otherwise,” they said, “we are all going to die!”
1851	2	12	34	12	34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, carrying it on their shoulders in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing.
1852	2	12	35	12	35	Furthermore, the Israelites acted on Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for clothing.
1853	2	12	36	12	36	And the LORD gave the people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that they granted their request. In this way they plundered the Egyptians.
1854	2	12	37	12	37	The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth with about 600,000 men on foot, besides women and children.
1855	2	12	38	12	38	And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with great droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
1856	2	12	39	12	39	Since their dough had no leaven, the people baked what they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves. For when they had been driven out of Egypt, they could not delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves.
1857	2	12	40	12	40	Now the duration of the Israelites’ stay in Egypt was 430 years.
1858	2	12	41	12	41	At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD’s divisions went out of the land of Egypt.
1859	2	12	42	12	42	Because the LORD kept a vigil that night to bring them out of the land of Egypt, this same night is to be a vigil to the LORD, to be observed by all the Israelites for the generations to come.
1860	2	12	43	12	43	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: No foreigner is to eat of it.
1861	2	12	44	12	44	But any slave who has been purchased may eat of it, after you have circumcised him.
1862	2	12	45	12	45	A temporary resident or hired hand shall not eat the Passover.
1863	2	12	46	12	46	It must be eaten inside one house. You are not to take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of the bones.
1864	2	12	47	12	47	The whole congregation of Israel must celebrate it.
1865	2	12	48	12	48	If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover, all the males in the household must be circumcised; then he may come near to celebrate it, and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.
1866	2	12	49	12	49	The same law shall apply to both the native and the foreigner who resides among you.”
1867	2	12	50	12	50	Then all the Israelites did this—they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
1868	2	12	51	12	51	And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.
1869	2	13	1	13	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
1870	2	13	2	13	2	“Consecrate to Me every firstborn male. The firstborn from every womb among the Israelites belongs to Me, both of man and beast.”
1871	2	13	3	13	3	So Moses told the people, “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand. And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
1872	2	13	4	13	4	Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
1873	2	13	5	13	5	And when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land He swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall keep this service in this month.
1874	2	13	6	13	6	For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
1875	2	13	7	13	7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders.
1876	2	13	8	13	8	And on that day you are to explain to your son, ‘This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
1877	2	13	9	13	9	It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the Law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
1878	2	13	10	13	10	Therefore you shall keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
1879	2	13	11	13	11	And after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as He swore to you and your fathers,
1880	2	13	12	13	12	you are to present to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.
1881	2	13	13	13	13	You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. And every firstborn of your sons you must redeem.
1882	2	13	14	13	14	In the future, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
1883	2	13	15	13	15	And when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’
1884	2	13	16	13	16	So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”
1885	2	13	17	13	17	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, though it was shorter. For God said, “If the people face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”
1886	2	13	18	13	18	So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle.
1887	2	13	19	13	19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath when he said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones with you from this place.”
1888	2	13	20	13	20	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
1889	2	13	21	13	21	And the LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or night.
1890	2	13	22	13	22	Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place before the people.
1891	2	14	1	14	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
1892	2	14	2	14	2	“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon.
1893	2	14	3	14	3	For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.’
1894	2	14	4	14	4	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So this is what the Israelites did.
1895	2	14	5	14	5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.”
1896	2	14	6	14	6	So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him.
1897	2	14	7	14	7	He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
1898	2	14	8	14	8	And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out with fists raised in defiance.
1899	2	14	9	14	9	The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
1900	2	14	10	14	10	As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to the LORD.
1901	2	14	11	14	11	They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us into the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
1902	2	14	12	14	12	Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
1903	2	14	13	14	13	But Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the LORD’s salvation, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again.
1904	2	14	14	14	14	The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
1905	2	14	15	14	15	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.
1906	2	14	16	14	16	And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
1907	2	14	17	14	17	And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen.
1908	2	14	18	14	18	The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
1909	2	14	19	14	19	And the angel of God, who had gone before the camp of Israel, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them,
1910	2	14	20	14	20	so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel. The cloud was there in the darkness, but it lit up the night. So all night long neither camp went near the other.
1911	2	14	21	14	21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind that turned it into dry land. So the waters were divided,
1912	2	14	22	14	22	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
1913	2	14	23	14	23	And the Egyptians chased after them—all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen—and followed them into the sea.
1914	2	14	24	14	24	At morning watch, however, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, and He threw their camp into confusion.
1915	2	14	25	14	25	He caused their chariot wheels to wobble, so that they had difficulty driving. “Let us flee from the Israelites,” said the Egyptians, “for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!”
1916	2	14	26	14	26	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”
1917	2	14	27	14	27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state. While the Egyptians were retreating, the LORD swept them into the sea.
1918	2	14	28	14	28	The waters flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had chased the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
1919	2	14	29	14	29	But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
1920	2	14	30	14	30	That day the LORD saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore.
1921	2	14	31	14	31	When Israel saw the great power that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses.
1922	2	15	1	15	1	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: “I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted. The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.
1923	2	15	2	15	2	The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
1924	2	15	3	15	3	The LORD is a warrior, the LORD is His name.
1925	2	15	4	15	4	Pharaoh’s chariots and army He has thrown into the sea; the finest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
1926	2	15	5	15	5	The depths have covered them; they sank there like a stone.
1927	2	15	6	15	6	Your right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power; Your right hand, O LORD, has shattered the enemy.
1928	2	15	7	15	7	You overthrew Your adversaries by Your great majesty. You unleashed Your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble.
1929	2	15	8	15	8	At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up; like a wall the currents stood firm; the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
1930	2	15	9	15	9	The enemy declared, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.’
1931	2	15	10	15	10	But You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
1932	2	15	11	15	11	Who among the gods is like You, O LORD? Who is like You—majestic in holiness, revered with praises, performing wonders?
1933	2	15	12	15	12	You stretched out Your right hand, and the earth swallowed them up.
1934	2	15	13	15	13	With loving devotion You will lead the people You have redeemed; with Your strength You will guide them to Your holy dwelling.
1935	2	15	14	15	14	The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia.
1936	2	15	15	15	15	Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; those who dwell in Canaan will melt away,
1937	2	15	16	15	16	and terror and dread will fall on them. By the power of Your arm they will be as still as a stone until Your people pass by, O LORD, until the people You bought pass by.
1938	2	15	17	15	17	You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance—the place, O LORD, You have prepared for Your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, Your hands have established.
1939	2	15	18	15	18	The LORD will reign forever and ever!”
1940	2	15	19	15	19	For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
1941	2	15	20	15	20	Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
1942	2	15	21	15	21	And Miriam sang back to them: “Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; the horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.”
1943	2	15	22	15	22	Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert without finding water.
1944	2	15	23	15	23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the water there because it was bitter. (That is why it was named Marah.)
1945	2	15	24	15	24	So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
1946	2	15	25	15	25	And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened. There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them,
1947	2	15	26	15	26	saying, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.”
1948	2	15	27	15	27	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the waters.
1949	2	16	1	16	1	On the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt, the whole congregation of Israel set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai.
1950	2	16	2	16	2	And there in the desert they all grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
1951	2	16	3	16	3	“If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt!” they said. “There we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread, but you have brought us into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death!”
1952	2	16	4	16	4	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test whether or not they will follow My instructions.
1953	2	16	5	16	5	Then on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”
1954	2	16	6	16	6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
1955	2	16	7	16	7	and in the morning you will see the LORD’s glory, because He has heard your grumbling against Him. For who are we that you should grumble against us?”
1956	2	16	8	16	8	And Moses added, “The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to fill you in the morning, for He has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”
1957	2	16	9	16	9	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole congregation of Israel, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has heard your grumbling.’”
1958	2	16	10	16	10	And as Aaron was speaking to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared.
1959	2	16	11	16	11	Then the LORD said to Moses,
1960	2	16	12	16	12	“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’”
1961	2	16	13	16	13	That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
1962	2	16	14	16	14	When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were thin flakes on the desert floor, as fine as frost on the ground.
1963	2	16	15	16	15	When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. So Moses told them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
1964	2	16	16	16	16	This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Each one is to gather as much as he needs. You may take an omer for each person in your tent.’”
1965	2	16	17	16	17	So the Israelites did this. Some gathered more, and some less.
1966	2	16	18	16	18	When they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat.
1967	2	16	19	16	19	Then Moses said to them, “No one may keep any of it until morning.”
1968	2	16	20	16	20	But they did not listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it became infested with maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
1969	2	16	21	16	21	Each morning they each gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
1970	2	16	22	16	22	On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food—two omers per person—and all the leaders of the congregation came and reported this to Moses.
1971	2	16	23	16	23	He told them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.’”
1972	2	16	24	16	24	So they set it aside until morning as Moses had commanded, and it did not smell or contain any maggots.
1973	2	16	25	16	25	“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you will not find anything in the field.
1974	2	16	26	16	26	For six days you may gather, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be there.”
1975	2	16	27	16	27	Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find anything.
1976	2	16	28	16	28	Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and instructions?
1977	2	16	29	16	29	Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days. On the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is; no one may leave his place.”
1978	2	16	30	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
1979	2	16	31	16	31	Now the house of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
1980	2	16	32	16	32	Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Keep an omer of manna for the generations to come, so that they may see the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”
1981	2	16	33	16	33	So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with an omer of manna. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved for the generations to come.”
1982	2	16	34	16	34	And Aaron placed it in front of the Testimony, to be preserved just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
1983	2	16	35	16	35	The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land where they could settle; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
1984	2	16	36	16	36	(Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
1985	2	17	1	17	1	Then the whole congregation of Israel left the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
1986	2	17	2	17	2	So the people contended with Moses, “Give us water to drink.” “Why do you contend with me?” Moses replied. “Why do you test the LORD?”
1987	2	17	3	17	3	But the people thirsted for water there, and they grumbled against Moses: “Why have you brought us out of Egypt—to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”
1988	2	17	4	17	4	Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What should I do with these people? A little more and they will stone me!”
1989	2	17	5	17	5	And the LORD said to Moses, “Walk on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take along in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
1990	2	17	6	17	6	Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb; when you strike the rock, water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
1991	2	17	7	17	7	He named the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”
1992	2	17	8	17	8	After this, the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
1993	2	17	9	17	9	So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with the staff of God in my hand.”
1994	2	17	10	17	10	Joshua did as Moses had instructed him and fought against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
1995	2	17	11	17	11	As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he lowered them, Amalek prevailed.
1996	2	17	12	17	12	When Moses’ hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down.
1997	2	17	13	17	13	So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army with the sword.
1998	2	17	14	17	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”
1999	2	17	15	17	15	And Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner.
2000	2	17	16	17	16	“Indeed,” he said, “a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD. The LORD will war against Amalek from generation to generation.”
2001	2	18	1	18	1	Now Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about all that God had done for Moses and His people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
2002	2	18	2	18	2	After Moses had sent back his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro had received her
2003	2	18	3	18	3	along with her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.”
2004	2	18	4	18	4	The other son was named Eliezer, for Moses had said, “The God of my father was my helper and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
2005	2	18	5	18	5	Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses’ wife and sons, came to him in the desert, where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
2006	2	18	6	18	6	He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”
2007	2	18	7	18	7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and went into the tent.
2008	2	18	8	18	8	Then Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships they had encountered along the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
2009	2	18	9	18	9	And Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the LORD had done for Israel, whom He had rescued from the hand of the Egyptians.
2010	2	18	10	18	10	Jethro declared, “Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
2011	2	18	11	18	11	Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for He did this when they treated Israel with arrogance.”
2012	2	18	12	18	12	Then Moses’ father-in-law Jethro brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.
2013	2	18	13	18	13	The next day Moses took his seat to judge the people, and they stood around him from morning until evening.
2014	2	18	14	18	14	When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone as judge, with all the people standing around you from morning till evening?”
2015	2	18	15	18	15	“Because the people come to me to inquire of God,” Moses replied.
2016	2	18	16	18	16	“Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me to judge between one man and another, and I make known to them the statutes and laws of God.”
2017	2	18	17	18	17	But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good.
2018	2	18	18	18	18	Surely you and these people with you will wear yourselves out, because the task is too heavy for you. You cannot handle it alone.
2019	2	18	19	18	19	Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their causes to Him.
2020	2	18	20	18	20	Teach them the statutes and laws, and show them the way to live and the work they must do.
2021	2	18	21	18	21	Furthermore, select capable men from among the people—God-fearing, trustworthy men who are averse to dishonest gain. Appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
2022	2	18	22	18	22	Have these men judge the people at all times. Then they can bring you any major issue, but all minor cases they can judge on their own, so that your load may be lightened as they share it with you.
2023	2	18	23	18	23	If you follow this advice and God so directs you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people can go home in peace.”
2024	2	18	24	18	24	Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
2025	2	18	25	18	25	So Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them heads over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
2026	2	18	26	18	26	And they judged the people at all times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but any minor issue they would judge themselves.
2027	2	18	27	18	27	Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own land.
2028	2	19	1	19	1	In the third month, on the same day of the month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai.
2029	2	19	2	19	2	After they had set out from Rephidim, they entered the Wilderness of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
2030	2	19	3	19	3	Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, “This is what you are to tell the house of Jacob and explain to the sons of Israel:
2031	2	19	4	19	4	‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.
2032	2	19	5	19	5	Now if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession out of all the nations—for the whole earth is Mine.
2033	2	19	6	19	6	And unto Me you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.”
2034	2	19	7	19	7	So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
2035	2	19	8	19	8	And all the people answered together, “We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.” So Moses brought their words back to the LORD.
2036	2	19	9	19	9	The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will always put their trust in you.” And Moses relayed the words of the people to the LORD.
2037	2	19	10	19	10	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes
2038	2	19	11	19	11	and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
2039	2	19	12	19	12	And you are to set up a boundary for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful not to go up on the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
2040	2	19	13	19	13	No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows—whether man or beast, he must not live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”
2041	2	19	14	19	14	When Moses came down from the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
2042	2	19	15	19	15	“Be prepared for the third day,” he said to the people. “Do not draw near to a woman.”
2043	2	19	16	19	16	On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud was upon the mountain, and a very loud blast of the ram’s horn went out, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
2044	2	19	17	19	17	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
2045	2	19	18	19	18	Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke, because the LORD had descended on it in fire. And the smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
2046	2	19	19	19	19	And as the sound of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.
2047	2	19	20	19	20	The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the summit. So Moses went up,
2048	2	19	21	19	21	and the LORD said to him, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to see the LORD, lest many of them perish.
2049	2	19	22	19	22	Even the priests who approach the LORD must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them.”
2050	2	19	23	19	23	But Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, for You solemnly warned us, ‘Put a boundary around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’”
2051	2	19	24	19	24	And the LORD replied, “Go down and bring Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to the LORD, or He will break out against them.”
2052	2	19	25	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
2053	2	20	1	20	1	And God spoke all these words:
2054	2	20	2	20	2	“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
2055	2	20	3	20	3	You shall have no other gods before Me.
2056	2	20	4	20	4	You shall not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens above, on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.
2057	2	20	5	20	5	You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
2058	2	20	6	20	6	but showing loving devotion to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
2059	2	20	7	20	7	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who takes His name in vain.
2060	2	20	8	20	8	Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
2061	2	20	9	20	9	Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
2062	2	20	10	20	10	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant or livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates.
2063	2	20	11	20	11	For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that is in them, but on the seventh day He rested. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy.
2064	2	20	12	20	12	Honor your father and mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
2065	2	20	13	20	13	You shall not murder.
2066	2	20	14	20	14	You shall not commit adultery.
2067	2	20	15	20	15	You shall not steal.
2068	2	20	16	20	16	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
2069	2	20	17	20	17	You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
2070	2	20	18	20	18	When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sounding of the ram’s horn, and the mountain enveloped in smoke, they trembled and stood at a distance.
2071	2	20	19	20	19	“Speak to us yourself and we will listen,” they said to Moses. “But do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”
2072	2	20	20	20	20	“Do not be afraid,” Moses replied. “For God has come to test you, so that the fear of Him may be before you, to keep you from sinning.”
2073	2	20	21	20	21	And the people stood at a distance as Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
2074	2	20	22	20	22	Then the LORD said to Moses, “This is what you are to tell the Israelites: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven.
2075	2	20	23	20	23	You are not to make any gods alongside Me; you are not to make for yourselves gods of silver or gold.
2076	2	20	24	20	24	You are to make for Me an altar of earth, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep and goats and cattle. In every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
2077	2	20	25	20	25	Now if you make an altar of stones for Me, you must not build it with stones shaped by tools; for if you use a chisel on it, you will defile it.
2078	2	20	26	20	26	And you must not go up to My altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.’”
2079	2	21	1	21	1	“These are the ordinances that you are to set before them:
2080	2	21	2	21	2	If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free without paying anything.
2081	2	21	3	21	3	If he arrived alone, he is to leave alone; if he arrived with a wife, she is to leave with him.
2082	2	21	4	21	4	If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.
2083	2	21	5	21	5	But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children; I do not want to go free,’
2084	2	21	6	21	6	then his master is to bring him before the judges. And he shall take him to the door or doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he shall serve his master for life.
2085	2	21	7	21	7	And if a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as the menservants do.
2086	2	21	8	21	8	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who had designated her for himself, he must allow her to be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, since he has broken faith with her.
2087	2	21	9	21	9	And if he chooses her for his son, he must deal with her as with a daughter.
2088	2	21	10	21	10	If he takes another wife, he must not reduce the food, clothing, or marital rights of his first wife.
2089	2	21	11	21	11	If, however, he does not provide her these three things, she is free to go without monetary payment.
2090	2	21	12	21	12	Whoever strikes and kills a man must surely be put to death.
2091	2	21	13	21	13	If, however, he did not lie in wait, but God allowed it to happen, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.
2092	2	21	14	21	14	But if a man schemes and acts willfully against his neighbor to kill him, you must take him away from My altar to be put to death.
2093	2	21	15	21	15	He who strikes his father or mother must surely be put to death.
2094	2	21	16	21	16	Whoever kidnaps another man must be put to death, whether he sells him or the man is found in his possession.
2095	2	21	17	21	17	Anyone who curses his father or mother must surely be put to death.
2096	2	21	18	21	18	If men are quarreling and one strikes the other with a stone or a fist, and he does not die but is confined to bed,
2097	2	21	19	21	19	then the one who struck him shall go unpunished, as long as the other can get up and walk around outside with his staff. Nevertheless, he must compensate the man for his lost work and see that he is completely healed.
2098	2	21	20	21	20	If a man strikes his manservant or maidservant with a rod, and the servant dies by his hand, he shall surely be punished.
2099	2	21	21	21	21	However, if the servant gets up after a day or two, the owner shall not be punished, since the servant is his property.
2100	2	21	22	21	22	If men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and her child is born prematurely, but there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman’s husband demands and as the court allows.
2101	2	21	23	21	23	But if a serious injury results, then you must require a life for a life—
2102	2	21	24	21	24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
2103	2	21	25	21	25	burn for burn, wound for wound, and stripe for stripe.
2104	2	21	26	21	26	If a man strikes and blinds the eye of his manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free as compensation for the eye.
2105	2	21	27	21	27	And if he knocks out the tooth of his manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free as compensation for the tooth.
2106	2	21	28	21	28	If an ox gores a man or woman to death, the ox must surely be stoned, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the ox shall not be held responsible.
2107	2	21	29	21	29	But if the ox has a habit of goring, and its owner has been warned yet does not restrain it, and it kills a man or woman, then the ox must be stoned and its owner must also be put to death.
2108	2	21	30	21	30	If payment is demanded of him instead, he may redeem his life by paying the full amount demanded of him.
2109	2	21	31	21	31	If the ox gores a son or a daughter, it shall be done to him according to the same rule.
2110	2	21	32	21	32	If the ox gores a manservant or maidservant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of that servant, and the ox must be stoned.
2111	2	21	33	21	33	If a man opens or digs a pit and fails to cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
2112	2	21	34	21	34	the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he must pay its owner, and the dead animal will be his.
2113	2	21	35	21	35	If a man’s ox injures his neighbor’s ox and it dies, they must sell the live one and divide the proceeds; they also must divide the dead animal.
2114	2	21	36	21	36	But if it was known that the ox had a habit of goring, yet its owner failed to restrain it, he shall pay full compensation, ox for ox, and the dead animal will be his.”
2115	2	21	37	22	1	“If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters or sells it, he must repay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
2116	2	22	1	22	2	If a thief is caught breaking in and is beaten to death, no one shall be guilty of bloodshed.
2117	2	22	2	22	3	But if it happens after sunrise, there is guilt for his bloodshed. A thief must make full restitution; if he has nothing, he himself shall be sold for his theft.
2118	2	22	3	22	4	If what was stolen is actually found alive in his possession—whether ox or donkey or sheep—he must pay back double.
2119	2	22	4	22	5	If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and allows them to stray so that they graze in someone else’s field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard.
2120	2	22	5	22	6	If a fire breaks out and spreads to thornbushes so that it consumes stacked or standing grain, or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make full restitution.
2121	2	22	6	22	7	If a man gives his neighbor money or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor’s house, the thief, if caught, must pay back double.
2122	2	22	7	22	8	If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has taken his neighbor’s property.
2123	2	22	8	22	9	In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any lost item that someone claims, ‘This is mine,’ both parties shall bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges find guilty must pay back double to his neighbor.
2124	2	22	9	22	10	If a man gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal to be cared for by his neighbor, but it dies or is injured or stolen while no one is watching,
2125	2	22	10	22	11	an oath before the LORD shall be made between the parties to determine whether or not the man has taken his neighbor’s property. The owner must accept the oath and require no restitution.
2126	2	22	11	22	12	But if the animal was actually stolen from the neighbor, he must make restitution to the owner.
2127	2	22	12	22	13	If it was torn to pieces, he shall bring it as evidence; he need not make restitution for the torn carcass.
2128	2	22	13	22	14	If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while its owner is not present, he must make full restitution.
2129	2	22	14	22	15	If the owner was present, no restitution is required. If the animal was rented, the fee covers the loss.
2130	2	22	15	22	16	If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged in marriage and sleeps with her, he must pay the full dowry for her to be his wife.
2131	2	22	16	22	17	If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, the man still must pay an amount comparable to the bridal price of a virgin.
2132	2	22	17	22	18	You must not allow a sorceress to live.
2133	2	22	18	22	19	Whoever lies with an animal must surely be put to death.
2134	2	22	19	22	20	If anyone sacrifices to any god other than the LORD alone, he must be set apart for destruction.
2135	2	22	20	22	21	You must not exploit or oppress a foreign resident, for you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
2136	2	22	21	22	22	You must not mistreat any widow or orphan.
2137	2	22	22	22	23	If you do mistreat them, and they cry out to Me in distress, I will surely hear their cry.
2138	2	22	23	22	24	My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will become widows and your children will be fatherless.
2139	2	22	24	22	25	If you lend money to one of My people among you who is poor, you must not act as a creditor to him; you are not to charge him any interest.
2140	2	22	25	22	26	If you take your neighbor’s cloak as collateral, return it to him by sunset,
2141	2	22	26	22	27	because his cloak is the only covering he has for his body. What else will he sleep in? And if he cries out to Me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
2142	2	22	27	22	28	You must not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.
2143	2	22	28	22	29	You must not hold back offerings from your granaries or vats. You are to give Me the firstborn of your sons.
2144	2	22	29	22	30	You shall do likewise with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but on the eighth day you are to give them to Me.
2145	2	22	30	22	31	You are to be My holy people. You must not eat the meat of a mauled animal found in the field; you are to throw it to the dogs.”
2146	2	23	1	23	1	“You shall not spread a false report. Do not join the wicked by being a malicious witness.
2147	2	23	2	23	2	You shall not follow the crowd in wrongdoing. When you testify in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd.
2148	2	23	3	23	3	And do not show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit.
2149	2	23	4	23	4	If you encounter your enemy’s stray ox or donkey, you must return it to him.
2150	2	23	5	23	5	If you see the donkey of one who hates you fallen under its load, do not leave it there; you must help him with it.
2151	2	23	6	23	6	You shall not deny justice to the poor in their lawsuits.
2152	2	23	7	23	7	Stay far away from a false accusation. Do not kill the innocent or the just, for I will not acquit the guilty.
2153	2	23	8	23	8	Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.
2154	2	23	9	23	9	Do not oppress a foreign resident, since you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
2155	2	23	10	23	10	For six years you are to sow your land and gather its produce,
2156	2	23	11	23	11	but in the seventh year you must let it rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat from the field and the wild animals may consume what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove.
2157	2	23	12	23	12	For six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you must cease, so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the son of your maidservant may be refreshed, as well as the foreign resident.
2158	2	23	13	23	13	Pay close attention to everything I have said to you. You must not invoke the names of other gods; they must not be heard on your lips.
2159	2	23	14	23	14	Three times a year you are to celebrate a feast to Me.
2160	2	23	15	23	15	You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread as I commanded you: At the appointed time in the month of Abib you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days, because that was the month you came out of Egypt. No one may appear before Me empty-handed.
2161	2	23	16	23	16	You are also to keep the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the produce from what you sow in the field. And keep the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your produce from the field.
2162	2	23	17	23	17	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD.
2163	2	23	18	23	18	You must not offer the blood of My sacrifices with anything leavened, nor may the fat of My feast remain until morning.
2164	2	23	19	23	19	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
2165	2	23	20	23	20	Behold, I am sending an angel before you to protect you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
2166	2	23	21	23	21	Pay attention to him and listen to his voice; do not defy him, for he will not forgive rebellion, since My Name is in him.
2167	2	23	22	23	22	But if you will listen carefully to his voice and do everything I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.
2168	2	23	23	23	23	For My angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will annihilate them.
2169	2	23	24	23	24	You must not bow down to their gods or serve them or follow their practices. Instead, you are to demolish them and smash their sacred stones to pieces.
2170	2	23	25	23	25	So you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take away sickness from among you.
2171	2	23	26	23	26	No woman in your land will miscarry or be barren; I will fulfill the number of your days.
2172	2	23	27	23	27	I will send My terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn and run.
2173	2	23	28	23	28	I will send the hornet before you to drive the Hivites and Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
2174	2	23	29	23	29	I will not drive them out before you in a single year; otherwise the land would become desolate and wild animals would multiply against you.
2175	2	23	30	23	30	Little by little I will drive them out ahead of you, until you become fruitful and possess the land.
2176	2	23	31	23	31	And I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the Euphrates. For I will deliver the inhabitants into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.
2177	2	23	32	23	32	You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
2178	2	23	33	23	33	They must not remain in your land, lest they cause you to sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.”
2179	2	24	1	24	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD—you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of Israel’s elders—and you are to worship at a distance.
2180	2	24	2	24	2	Moses alone shall approach the LORD, but the others must not come near. And the people may not go up with him.”
2181	2	24	3	24	3	When Moses came and told the people all the words and ordinances of the LORD, they all responded with one voice: “All the words that the LORD has spoken, we will do.”
2182	2	24	4	24	4	And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Early the next morning he got up and built an altar at the base of the mountain, along with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
2183	2	24	5	24	5	Then he sent out some young men of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
2184	2	24	6	24	6	Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
2185	2	24	7	24	7	Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people, who replied, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”
2186	2	24	8	24	8	So Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”
2187	2	24	9	24	9	Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
2188	2	24	10	24	10	and they saw the God of Israel. Under His feet was a work like a pavement made of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.
2189	2	24	11	24	11	But God did not lay His hand on the nobles of Israel; they saw Him, and they ate and drank.
2190	2	24	12	24	12	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and stay here, so that I may give you the tablets of stone, with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.”
2191	2	24	13	24	13	So Moses set out with Joshua his attendant and went up on the mountain of God.
2192	2	24	14	24	14	And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are here with you. Whoever has a dispute can go to them.”
2193	2	24	15	24	15	When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it,
2194	2	24	16	24	16	and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered it, and on the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from within the cloud.
2195	2	24	17	24	17	And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop in the eyes of the Israelites.
2196	2	24	18	24	18	Moses entered the cloud as he went up on the mountain, and he remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
2197	2	25	1	25	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2198	2	25	2	25	2	“Tell the Israelites to bring Me an offering. You are to receive My offering from every man whose heart compels him.
2199	2	25	3	25	3	This is the offering you are to accept from them: gold, silver, and bronze;
2200	2	25	4	25	4	blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;
2201	2	25	5	25	5	ram skins dyed red and fine leather; acacia wood;
2202	2	25	6	25	6	olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
2203	2	25	7	25	7	and onyx stones and gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
2204	2	25	8	25	8	And they are to make a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them.
2205	2	25	9	25	9	You must make the tabernacle and design all its furnishings according to the pattern I show you.
2206	2	25	10	25	10	And they are to construct an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2207	2	25	11	25	11	Overlay it with pure gold both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.
2208	2	25	12	25	12	Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other.
2209	2	25	13	25	13	And make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
2210	2	25	14	25	14	Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, in order to carry it.
2211	2	25	15	25	15	The poles are to remain in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed.
2212	2	25	16	25	16	And place inside the ark the Testimony, which I will give you.
2213	2	25	17	25	17	And you are to construct a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2214	2	25	18	25	18	Make two cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat,
2215	2	25	19	25	19	one cherub on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold.
2216	2	25	20	25	20	And the cherubim are to have wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat. The cherubim are to face one another, looking toward the mercy seat.
2217	2	25	21	25	21	Set the mercy seat atop the ark, and put the Testimony that I will give you into the ark.
2218	2	25	22	25	22	And I will meet with you there above the mercy seat, between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the Testimony; I will speak with you about all that I command you regarding the Israelites.
2219	2	25	23	25	23	You are also to make a table of acacia wood two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2220	2	25	24	25	24	Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
2221	2	25	25	25	25	And make a rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
2222	2	25	26	25	26	Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners at its four legs.
2223	2	25	27	25	27	The rings are to be close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table.
2224	2	25	28	25	28	Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that the table may be carried with them.
2225	2	25	29	25	29	You are also to make the plates and dishes, as well as the pitchers and bowls for pouring drink offerings. Make them out of pure gold.
2226	2	25	30	25	30	And place the Bread of the Presence on the table before Me at all times.
2227	2	25	31	25	31	Then you are to make a lampstand of pure, hammered gold. It shall be made of one piece, including its base and shaft, its cups, and its buds and petals.
2228	2	25	32	25	32	Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
2229	2	25	33	25	33	There are to be three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extend from the lampstand.
2230	2	25	34	25	34	And on the lampstand there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals.
2231	2	25	35	25	35	For the six branches that extend from the lampstand, a bud must be under the first pair of branches, a bud under the second pair, and a bud under the third pair.
2232	2	25	36	25	36	The buds and branches are to be all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
2233	2	25	37	25	37	Make seven lamps and set them up on the lampstand so that they illuminate the area in front of it.
2234	2	25	38	25	38	The wick trimmers and their trays must be of pure gold.
2235	2	25	39	25	39	The lampstand and all these utensils shall be made from a talent of pure gold.
2236	2	25	40	25	40	See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
2237	2	26	1	26	1	“You are to construct the tabernacle itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them.
2238	2	26	2	26	2	Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide—all curtains the same size.
2239	2	26	3	26	3	Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well.
2240	2	26	4	26	4	Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.
2241	2	26	5	26	5	Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another.
2242	2	26	6	26	6	Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.
2243	2	26	7	26	7	You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.
2244	2	26	8	26	8	Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
2245	2	26	9	26	9	Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent.
2246	2	26	10	26	10	Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
2247	2	26	11	26	11	Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit.
2248	2	26	12	26	12	As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.
2249	2	26	13	26	13	And the tent curtains will be a cubit longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.
2250	2	26	14	26	14	Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.
2251	2	26	15	26	15	You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
2252	2	26	16	26	16	Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2253	2	26	17	26	17	Two tenons must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
2254	2	26	18	26	18	Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,
2255	2	26	19	26	19	with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.
2256	2	26	20	26	20	For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames
2257	2	26	21	26	21	and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.
2258	2	26	22	26	22	Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,
2259	2	26	23	26	23	and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,
2260	2	26	24	26	24	coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners.
2261	2	26	25	26	25	So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
2262	2	26	26	26	26	You are to also make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2263	2	26	27	26	27	five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.
2264	2	26	28	26	28	The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other.
2265	2	26	29	26	29	Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.
2266	2	26	30	26	30	So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
2267	2	26	31	26	31	Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
2268	2	26	32	26	32	Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.
2269	2	26	33	26	33	And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the veil. So the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.
2270	2	26	34	26	34	Put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.
2271	2	26	35	26	35	And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side.
2272	2	26	36	26	36	For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.
2273	2	26	37	26	37	Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them.”
2274	2	27	1	27	1	“You are to build an altar of acacia wood. The altar must be square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.
2275	2	27	2	27	2	Make a horn on each of its four corners, so that the horns are of one piece, and overlay it with bronze.
2276	2	27	3	27	3	Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots for removing ashes, its shovels, its sprinkling bowls, its meat forks, and its firepans.
2277	2	27	4	27	4	Construct for it a grate of bronze mesh, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the mesh.
2278	2	27	5	27	5	Set the grate beneath the ledge of the altar, so that the mesh comes halfway up the altar.
2279	2	27	6	27	6	Additionally, make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze.
2280	2	27	7	27	7	The poles are to be inserted into the rings so that the poles are on two sides of the altar when it is carried.
2281	2	27	8	27	8	Construct the altar with boards so that it is hollow. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain.
2282	2	27	9	27	9	You are also to make a courtyard for the tabernacle. On the south side of the courtyard make curtains of finely spun linen, a hundred cubits long on one side,
2283	2	27	10	27	10	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts.
2284	2	27	11	27	11	Likewise there are to be curtains on the north side, a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
2285	2	27	12	27	12	The curtains on the west side of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits wide, with ten posts and ten bases.
2286	2	27	13	27	13	The east side of the courtyard, toward the sunrise, is to be fifty cubits wide.
2287	2	27	14	27	14	Make the curtains on one side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases,
2288	2	27	15	27	15	and the curtains on the other side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.
2289	2	27	16	27	16	The gate of the courtyard shall be twenty cubits long, with a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It shall have four posts and four bases.
2290	2	27	17	27	17	All the posts around the courtyard shall have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases.
2291	2	27	18	27	18	The entire courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases.
2292	2	27	19	27	19	All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made of bronze.
2293	2	27	20	27	20	And you are to command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.
2294	2	27	21	27	21	In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a perpetual statute for the Israelites for the generations to come.”
2295	2	28	1	28	1	“Next, have your brother Aaron brought to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, to serve Me as priests.
2296	2	28	2	28	2	Make holy garments for your brother Aaron, to give him glory and splendor.
2297	2	28	3	28	3	You are to instruct all the skilled craftsmen, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, to make garments for Aaron’s consecration, so that he may serve Me as priest.
2298	2	28	4	28	4	These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that they may serve Me as priests.
2299	2	28	5	28	5	They shall use gold, along with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
2300	2	28	6	28	6	They are to make the ephod of finely spun linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
2301	2	28	7	28	7	It shall have two shoulder pieces attached at two of its corners, so it can be fastened.
2302	2	28	8	28	8	And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod must be of one piece, of the same workmanship—with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen.
2303	2	28	9	28	9	Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel:
2304	2	28	10	28	10	six of their names on one stone and the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth.
2305	2	28	11	28	11	Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree settings.
2306	2	28	12	28	12	Fasten both stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear their names on his two shoulders as a memorial before the LORD.
2307	2	28	13	28	13	Fashion gold filigree settings
2308	2	28	14	28	14	and two chains of pure gold, made of braided cord work; and attach these chains to the settings.
2309	2	28	15	28	15	You are also to make a breastpiece of judgment with the same workmanship as the ephod. Construct it with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen.
2310	2	28	16	28	16	It must be square when folded over double, a span long and a span wide.
2311	2	28	17	28	17	And mount on it a setting of gemstones, four rows of stones: In the first row there shall be a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald;
2312	2	28	18	28	18	in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
2313	2	28	19	28	19	in the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
2314	2	28	20	28	20	and in the fourth row a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. Mount these stones in gold filigree settings.
2315	2	28	21	28	21	The twelve stones are to correspond to the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
2316	2	28	22	28	22	For the breastpiece make braided chains like cords of pure gold.
2317	2	28	23	28	23	You are also to make two gold rings and fasten them to the two corners of the breastpiece.
2318	2	28	24	28	24	Then fasten the two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
2319	2	28	25	28	25	and fasten the other ends of the two chains to the two filigree settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
2320	2	28	26	28	26	Make two more gold rings and attach them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod.
2321	2	28	27	28	27	Make two additional gold rings and attach them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its front, near its seam just above its woven waistband.
2322	2	28	28	28	28	The rings of the breastpiece shall be tied to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece is above the waistband of the ephod and does not swing out from the ephod.
2323	2	28	29	28	29	Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he shall bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breastpiece of judgment, as a continual reminder before the LORD.
2324	2	28	30	28	30	And place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece of judgment, so that they will also be over Aaron’s heart whenever he comes before the LORD. Aaron will continually carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD.
2325	2	28	31	28	31	You are to make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth,
2326	2	28	32	28	32	with an opening at its top in the center. Around the opening shall be a woven collar with an opening like that of a garment, so that it will not tear.
2327	2	28	33	28	33	Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn all the way around the lower hem, with gold bells between them,
2328	2	28	34	28	34	alternating the gold bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe.
2329	2	28	35	28	35	Aaron must wear the robe whenever he ministers, and its sound will be heard when he enters or exits the sanctuary before the LORD, so that he will not die.
2330	2	28	36	28	36	You are to make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it as on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.
2331	2	28	37	28	37	Fasten to it a blue cord to mount it on the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban.
2332	2	28	38	28	38	And it will be worn on Aaron’s forehead, so that he may bear the iniquity of the holy things that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all their holy gifts. It shall always be on his forehead, so that they may be acceptable before the LORD.
2333	2	28	39	28	39	You are to weave the tunic with fine linen, make the turban of fine linen, and fashion an embroidered sash.
2334	2	28	40	28	40	Make tunics, sashes, and headbands for Aaron’s sons, to give them glory and splendor.
2335	2	28	41	28	41	After you put these garments on your brother Aaron and his sons, anoint them, ordain them, and consecrate them so that they may serve Me as priests.
2336	2	28	42	28	42	Make linen undergarments to cover their bare flesh, extending from waist to thigh.
2337	2	28	43	28	43	Aaron and his sons must wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur guilt and die. This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants.”
2338	2	29	1	29	1	“Now this is what you are to do to consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests: Take a young bull and two rams without blemish,
2339	2	29	2	29	2	along with unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil. Make them out of fine wheat flour,
2340	2	29	3	29	3	put them in a basket, and present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams.
2341	2	29	4	29	4	Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water.
2342	2	29	5	29	5	Take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastplate. Fasten the ephod on him with its woven waistband.
2343	2	29	6	29	6	Put the turban on his head and attach the holy diadem to the turban.
2344	2	29	7	29	7	Then take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head.
2345	2	29	8	29	8	Bring his sons as well, and clothe them with tunics.
2346	2	29	9	29	9	Wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons and tie headbands on them. The priesthood shall be theirs by a perpetual statute. In this way you are to ordain Aaron and his sons.
2347	2	29	10	29	10	Bring the bull to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head.
2348	2	29	11	29	11	And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2349	2	29	12	29	12	Take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger; then pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2350	2	29	13	29	13	Take all the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with the fat on them, and burn them on the altar.
2351	2	29	14	29	14	But burn the flesh of the bull and its hide and dung outside the camp; it is a sin offering.
2352	2	29	15	29	15	Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head.
2353	2	29	16	29	16	You are to slaughter the ram, take its blood, and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar.
2354	2	29	17	29	17	Cut the ram into pieces, wash the entrails and legs, and place them with its head and other pieces.
2355	2	29	18	29	18	Then burn the entire ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2356	2	29	19	29	19	Take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on its head.
2357	2	29	20	29	20	Slaughter the ram, take some of its blood, and put it on the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Sprinkle the remaining blood on all sides of the altar.
2358	2	29	21	29	21	And take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and their garments. Then he and his garments will be consecrated, as well as his sons and their garments.
2359	2	29	22	29	22	Take the fat from the ram, the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the lobe of the liver, both kidneys with the fat on them, and the right thigh (since this is a ram for ordination),
2360	2	29	23	29	23	along with one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD.
2361	2	29	24	29	24	Put all these into the hands of Aaron and his sons and wave them before the LORD as a wave offering.
2362	2	29	25	29	25	Then take them from their hands and burn them on the altar atop the burnt offering as a pleasing aroma before the LORD; it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2363	2	29	26	29	26	Take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination and wave it before the LORD as a wave offering, and it will be your portion.
2364	2	29	27	29	27	Consecrate for Aaron and his sons the breast of the wave offering that is waved and the thigh of the heave offering that is lifted up from the ram of ordination.
2365	2	29	28	29	28	This will belong to Aaron and his sons as a regular portion from the Israelites, for it is the heave offering the Israelites will make to the LORD from their peace offerings.
2366	2	29	29	29	29	The holy garments that belong to Aaron will belong to his sons after him, so they can be anointed and ordained in them.
2367	2	29	30	29	30	The son who succeeds him as priest and enters the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place must wear them for seven days.
2368	2	29	31	29	31	You are to take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.
2369	2	29	32	29	32	At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the bread that is in the basket.
2370	2	29	33	29	33	They must eat those things by which atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no outsider may eat them, because these things are sacred.
2371	2	29	34	29	34	And if any of the meat of ordination or any bread is left until the morning, burn up the remainder. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred.
2372	2	29	35	29	35	This is what you are to do for Aaron and his sons based on all that I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them.
2373	2	29	36	29	36	Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it.
2374	2	29	37	29	37	For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will become most holy; whatever touches the altar will be holy.
2375	2	29	38	29	38	This is what you are to offer regularly on the altar, each day: two lambs that are a year old.
2376	2	29	39	29	39	In the morning offer one lamb, and at twilight offer the other.
2377	2	29	40	29	40	With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed olives, and a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.
2378	2	29	41	29	41	And you shall offer the second lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2379	2	29	42	29	42	For the generations to come, this burnt offering shall be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak with you.
2380	2	29	43	29	43	I will also meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be consecrated by My glory.
2381	2	29	44	29	44	So I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests.
2382	2	29	45	29	45	Then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
2383	2	29	46	29	46	And they will know that I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.”
2384	2	30	1	30	1	“You are also to make an altar of acacia wood for the burning of incense.
2385	2	30	2	30	2	It is to be square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns must be of one piece.
2386	2	30	3	30	3	Overlay with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns, and make a molding of gold around it.
2387	2	30	4	30	4	And make two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it.
2388	2	30	5	30	5	Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
2389	2	30	6	30	6	Place the altar in front of the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony—before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony—where I will meet with you.
2390	2	30	7	30	7	And Aaron is to burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps.
2391	2	30	8	30	8	When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he must burn the incense perpetually before the LORD for the generations to come.
2392	2	30	9	30	9	On this altar you must not offer unauthorized incense or a burnt offering or grain offering; nor are you to pour a drink offering on it.
2393	2	30	10	30	10	Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on the horns of the altar. Throughout your generations he shall make atonement on it annually with the blood of the sin offering of atonement. The altar is most holy to the LORD.”
2394	2	30	11	30	11	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2395	2	30	12	30	12	“When you take a census of the Israelites to number them, each man must pay the LORD a ransom for his life when he is counted. Then no plague will come upon them when they are numbered.
2396	2	30	13	30	13	Everyone who crosses over to those counted must pay a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering to the LORD.
2397	2	30	14	30	14	Everyone twenty years of age or older who crosses over must give this offering to the LORD.
2398	2	30	15	30	15	In making the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives, the rich shall not give more than a half shekel, nor shall the poor give less.
2399	2	30	16	30	16	Take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD to make atonement for your lives.”
2400	2	30	17	30	17	Again, the LORD said to Moses,
2401	2	30	18	30	18	“You are to make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it,
2402	2	30	19	30	19	with which Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet.
2403	2	30	20	30	20	Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister by presenting an offering made by fire to the LORD, they must wash with water so that they will not die.
2404	2	30	21	30	21	Thus they are to wash their hands and feet so that they will not die; this shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”
2405	2	30	22	30	22	Once again, the LORD said to Moses,
2406	2	30	23	30	23	“Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half that amount (250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane,
2407	2	30	24	30	24	500 shekels of cassia—all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil.
2408	2	30	25	30	25	Prepare from these a holy anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer; it will be a holy anointing oil.
2409	2	30	26	30	26	Use this oil to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony,
2410	2	30	27	30	27	the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,
2411	2	30	28	30	28	the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
2412	2	30	29	30	29	You are to consecrate them so that they will be most holy. Whatever touches them will be holy.
2413	2	30	30	30	30	Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them to serve Me as priests.
2414	2	30	31	30	31	And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘This will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.
2415	2	30	32	30	32	It must not be used to anoint an ordinary man, and you must not make anything like it with the same formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to you.
2416	2	30	33	30	33	Anyone who mixes perfume like it or puts it on an outsider shall be cut off from his people.’”
2417	2	30	34	30	34	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense—in equal measures,
2418	2	30	35	30	35	and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
2419	2	30	36	30	36	Grind some of it into fine powder and place it in front of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
2420	2	30	37	30	37	You are never to use this formula to make incense for yourselves; you shall regard it as sacred to the LORD.
2421	2	30	38	30	38	Anyone who makes something like it to enjoy its fragrance shall be cut off from his people.”
2422	2	31	1	31	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2423	2	31	2	31	2	“See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
2424	2	31	3	31	3	And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship,
2425	2	31	4	31	4	to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
2426	2	31	5	31	5	to cut gemstones for settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every craft.
2427	2	31	6	31	6	Moreover, I have selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. I have also given skill to all the craftsmen, that they may fashion all that I have commanded you:
2428	2	31	7	31	7	the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat upon it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—
2429	2	31	8	31	8	the table with its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
2430	2	31	9	31	9	the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand—
2431	2	31	10	31	10	as well as the woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,
2432	2	31	11	31	11	in addition to the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.”
2433	2	31	12	31	12	And the LORD said to Moses,
2434	2	31	13	31	13	“Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep My Sabbaths, for this will be a sign between Me and you for the generations to come, so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
2435	2	31	14	31	14	Keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Whoever profanes it must surely be put to death. Anyone who does work on that day must be cut off from his people.
2436	2	31	15	31	15	Work may be done for six days, but the seventh day must be a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.
2437	2	31	16	31	16	The Israelites must keep the Sabbath, celebrating it as a lasting covenant for the generations to come.
2438	2	31	17	31	17	It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’”
2439	2	31	18	31	18	When the LORD had finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
2440	2	32	1	32	1	Now when the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!”
2441	2	32	2	32	2	So Aaron told them, “Take off the gold earrings that are on your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me.”
2442	2	32	3	32	3	Then all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
2443	2	32	4	32	4	He took the gold from their hands, and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf. And they said, “These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
2444	2	32	5	32	5	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before the calf and proclaimed: “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.”
2445	2	32	6	32	6	So the next day they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to indulge in revelry.
2446	2	32	7	32	7	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
2447	2	32	8	32	8	How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it. They have sacrificed to it and said, ‘These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’”
2448	2	32	9	32	9	The LORD also said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.
2449	2	32	10	32	10	Now leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and consume them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
2450	2	32	11	32	11	But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God, saying, “O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
2451	2	32	12	32	12	Why should the Egyptians declare, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce anger and relent from doing harm to Your people.
2452	2	32	13	32	13	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom You swore by Your very self when You declared, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised, and it shall be their inheritance forever.’”
2453	2	32	14	32	14	So the LORD relented from the calamity He had threatened to bring on His people.
2454	2	32	15	32	15	Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
2455	2	32	16	32	16	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
2456	2	32	17	32	17	When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “The sound of war is in the camp.”
2457	2	32	18	32	18	But Moses replied: “It is neither the cry of victory nor the cry of defeat; I hear the sound of singing!”
2458	2	32	19	32	19	As Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he burned with anger and threw the tablets out of his hands, shattering them at the base of the mountain.
2459	2	32	20	32	20	Then he took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, and scattered the powder over the face of the water. Then he forced the Israelites to drink it.
2460	2	32	21	32	21	“What did this people do to you,” Moses asked Aaron, “that you have led them into so great a sin?”
2461	2	32	22	32	22	“Do not be enraged, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil.
2462	2	32	23	32	23	They told me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!’
2463	2	32	24	32	24	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, let him take it off,’ and they gave it to me. And when I cast it into the fire, out came this calf!”
2464	2	32	25	32	25	Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them run wild and become a laughingstock to their enemies.
2465	2	32	26	32	26	So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” And all the Levites gathered around him.
2466	2	32	27	32	27	He told them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each of you men is to fasten his sword to his side, go back and forth through the camp from gate to gate, and slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’”
2467	2	32	28	32	28	The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people fell dead.
2468	2	32	29	32	29	Afterward, Moses said, “Today you have been ordained for service to the LORD, since each man went against his son and his brother; so the LORD has bestowed a blessing on you this day.”
2469	2	32	30	32	30	The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
2470	2	32	31	32	31	So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made gods of gold for themselves.
2471	2	32	32	32	32	Yet now, if You would only forgive their sin... But if not, please blot me out of the book that You have written.”
2472	2	32	33	32	33	The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book.
2473	2	32	34	32	34	Now go, lead the people to the place I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will punish them for their sin.”
2474	2	32	35	32	35	And the LORD sent a plague on the people because of what they had done with the calf that Aaron had made.
2475	2	33	1	33	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’
2476	2	33	2	33	2	And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2477	2	33	3	33	3	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.”
2478	2	33	4	33	4	When the people heard these bad tidings, they went into mourning, and no one put on any of his jewelry.
2479	2	33	5	33	5	For the LORD had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what to do with you.’”
2480	2	33	6	33	6	So the Israelites stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
2481	2	33	7	33	7	Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it at a distance outside the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting, and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp.
2482	2	33	8	33	8	Then, whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent.
2483	2	33	9	33	9	As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
2484	2	33	10	33	10	When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up and worship, each one at the entrance to his own tent.
2485	2	33	11	33	11	Thus the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent.
2486	2	33	12	33	12	Then Moses said to the LORD, “Look, You have been telling me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have found favor in My sight.’
2487	2	33	13	33	13	Now if indeed I have found favor in Your sight, please let me know Your ways, that I may know You and find favor in Your sight. Remember that this nation is Your people.”
2488	2	33	14	33	14	And the LORD answered, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
2489	2	33	15	33	15	“If Your Presence does not go with us,” Moses replied, “do not lead us up from here.
2490	2	33	16	33	16	For how then can it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight, unless You go with us? How else will we be distinguished from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
2491	2	33	17	33	17	And the LORD said to Moses, “I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight, and I know you by name.”
2492	2	33	18	33	18	Then Moses said, “Please show me Your glory.”
2493	2	33	19	33	19	“I will cause all My goodness to pass before you,” the LORD replied, “and I will proclaim My name—the LORD—in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
2494	2	33	20	33	20	But He added, “You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.”
2495	2	33	21	33	21	The LORD continued, “There is a place near Me where you are to stand upon a rock,
2496	2	33	22	33	22	and when My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.
2497	2	33	23	33	23	Then I will take My hand away, and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.”
2498	2	34	1	34	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
2499	2	34	2	34	2	Be ready in the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me on the mountaintop.
2500	2	34	3	34	3	No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
2501	2	34	4	34	4	So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals. He rose early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hands, he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him.
2502	2	34	5	34	5	And the LORD descended in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name, the LORD.
2503	2	34	6	34	6	Then the LORD passed in front of Moses and called out: “The LORD, the LORD God, is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness,
2504	2	34	7	34	7	maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet He will by no means excuse the guilty; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers on their children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”
2505	2	34	8	34	8	Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
2506	2	34	9	34	9	“O Lord,” he said, “if I have indeed found favor in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our iniquity and sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”
2507	2	34	10	34	10	And the LORD said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among whom you live will see the LORD’s work, for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you.
2508	2	34	11	34	11	Observe what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
2509	2	34	12	34	12	Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a snare in your midst.
2510	2	34	13	34	13	Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles.
2511	2	34	14	34	14	For you must not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
2512	2	34	15	34	15	Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices;
2513	2	34	16	34	16	and when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to do the same.
2514	2	34	17	34	17	You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.
2515	2	34	18	34	18	You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
2516	2	34	19	34	19	The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock, whether cattle or sheep.
2517	2	34	20	34	20	You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed.
2518	2	34	21	34	21	Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and harvesting, you must rest.
2519	2	34	22	34	22	And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
2520	2	34	23	34	23	Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
2521	2	34	24	34	24	For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
2522	2	34	25	34	25	Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
2523	2	34	26	34	26	Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
2524	2	34	27	34	27	The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
2525	2	34	28	34	28	So Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.
2526	2	34	29	34	29	And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant from speaking with the LORD.
2527	2	34	30	34	30	Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was radiant. And they were afraid to approach him.
2528	2	34	31	34	31	But Moses called out to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.
2529	2	34	32	34	32	And after this all the Israelites came near, and Moses commanded them to do everything that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.
2530	2	34	33	34	33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
2531	2	34	34	34	34	But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded,
2532	2	34	35	34	35	and the Israelites would see that the face of Moses was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.
2533	2	35	1	35	1	Then Moses assembled the whole congregation of Israel and said to them, “These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:
2534	2	35	2	35	2	For six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you are to have a holy Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD. Anyone who does work on that day must be put to death.
2535	2	35	3	35	3	Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”
2536	2	35	4	35	4	Moses also told the whole congregation of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded:
2537	2	35	5	35	5	Take from among you an offering to the LORD. Let everyone whose heart is willing bring an offering to the LORD: gold, silver, and bronze;
2538	2	35	6	35	6	blue, purple, and scarlet yarn; fine linen and goat hair;
2539	2	35	7	35	7	ram skins dyed red and fine leather; acacia wood;
2540	2	35	8	35	8	olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
2541	2	35	9	35	9	and onyx stones and gemstones to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
2542	2	35	10	35	10	Let every skilled craftsman among you come and make everything that the LORD has commanded:
2543	2	35	11	35	11	the tabernacle with its tent and covering, its clasps and frames, its crossbars, posts, and bases;
2544	2	35	12	35	12	the ark with its poles and mercy seat, and the veil to shield it;
2545	2	35	13	35	13	the table with its poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;
2546	2	35	14	35	14	the lampstand for light with its accessories and lamps and oil for the light;
2547	2	35	15	35	15	the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;
2548	2	35	16	35	16	the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
2549	2	35	17	35	17	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard;
2550	2	35	18	35	18	the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, along with their ropes;
2551	2	35	19	35	19	and the woven garments for ministering in the holy place—both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.”
2552	2	35	20	35	20	Then the whole congregation of Israel withdrew from the presence of Moses.
2553	2	35	21	35	21	And everyone whose heart stirred him and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its services, and for the sacred garments.
2554	2	35	22	35	22	So all who had willing hearts, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry. And they all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
2555	2	35	23	35	23	Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or articles of fine leather brought them.
2556	2	35	24	35	24	And all who could present an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a contribution to the LORD. Also, everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the service brought it.
2557	2	35	25	35	25	Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun: blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen.
2558	2	35	26	35	26	And all the skilled women whose hearts were stirred spun the goat hair.
2559	2	35	27	35	27	The leaders brought onyx stones and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece,
2560	2	35	28	35	28	as well as spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
2561	2	35	29	35	29	So all the men and women of the Israelites whose hearts prompted them brought a freewill offering to the LORD for all the work that the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.
2562	2	35	30	35	30	Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
2563	2	35	31	35	31	And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship,
2564	2	35	32	35	32	to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,
2565	2	35	33	35	33	to cut gemstones for settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every artistic craft.
2566	2	35	34	35	34	And the LORD has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
2567	2	35	35	35	35	He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and as weavers—as artistic designers of every kind of craft.”
2568	2	36	1	36	1	“So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person are to carry out everything commanded by the LORD, who has given them skill and ability to know how to perform all the work of constructing the sanctuary.”
2569	2	36	2	36	2	Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person whom the LORD had gifted—everyone whose heart stirred him to come and do the work.
2570	2	36	3	36	3	They received from Moses all the contributions that the Israelites had brought to carry out the service of constructing the sanctuary. Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning,
2571	2	36	4	36	4	so that all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work
2572	2	36	5	36	5	and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD has commanded us to do.”
2573	2	36	6	36	6	After Moses had given an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more,
2574	2	36	7	36	7	since what they already had was more than enough to perform all the work.
2575	2	36	8	36	8	All the skilled craftsmen among the workmen made the ten curtains for the tabernacle. They were made of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim skillfully worked into them.
2576	2	36	9	36	9	Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were the same size.
2577	2	36	10	36	10	And he joined five of the curtains together, and the other five he joined as well.
2578	2	36	11	36	11	He made loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and also on the end curtain in the second set.
2579	2	36	12	36	12	He made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops lined up opposite one another.
2580	2	36	13	36	13	He also made fifty gold clasps to join the curtains together, so that the tabernacle was a unit.
2581	2	36	14	36	14	He then made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.
2582	2	36	15	36	15	Each of the eleven curtains was the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
2583	2	36	16	36	16	He joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another.
2584	2	36	17	36	17	He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
2585	2	36	18	36	18	He also made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together as a unit.
2586	2	36	19	36	19	Additionally, he made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.
2587	2	36	20	36	20	Next, he constructed upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
2588	2	36	21	36	21	Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2589	2	36	22	36	22	Two tenons were connected to each other for each frame. He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
2590	2	36	23	36	23	He constructed twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,
2591	2	36	24	36	24	with forty silver bases to put under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.
2592	2	36	25	36	25	For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames
2593	2	36	26	36	26	and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.
2594	2	36	27	36	27	He made six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,
2595	2	36	28	36	28	and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,
2596	2	36	29	36	29	coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. He made both corners in this way.
2597	2	36	30	36	30	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
2598	2	36	31	36	31	He also made five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
2599	2	36	32	36	32	five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.
2600	2	36	33	36	33	He made the central crossbar to run through the center of the frames, from one end to the other.
2601	2	36	34	36	34	And he overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
2602	2	36	35	36	35	Next, he made the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
2603	2	36	36	36	36	He also made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold, along with gold hooks; and he cast four silver bases for the posts.
2604	2	36	37	36	37	For the entrance to the tent, he made a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,
2605	2	36	38	36	38	together with five posts and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, and their five bases were bronze.
2606	2	37	1	37	1	Bezalel went on to construct the ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2607	2	37	2	37	2	He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.
2608	2	37	3	37	3	And he cast four gold rings for its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other.
2609	2	37	4	37	4	Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
2610	2	37	5	37	5	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to carry it.
2611	2	37	6	37	6	He constructed a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
2612	2	37	7	37	7	He made two cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat,
2613	2	37	8	37	8	one cherub on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold.
2614	2	37	9	37	9	And the cherubim had wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat. The cherubim faced one another, looking toward the mercy seat.
2615	2	37	10	37	10	He also made the table of acacia wood two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
2616	2	37	11	37	11	He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
2617	2	37	12	37	12	And he made a rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
2618	2	37	13	37	13	He cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners at its four legs.
2619	2	37	14	37	14	The rings were placed close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles used to carry the table.
2620	2	37	15	37	15	He made the poles of acacia wood for carrying the table and overlaid them with gold.
2621	2	37	16	37	16	He also made the utensils for the table out of pure gold: its plates and dishes, as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings.
2622	2	37	17	37	17	Then he made the lampstand out of pure hammered gold, all of one piece: its base and shaft, its cups, and its buds and petals.
2623	2	37	18	37	18	Six branches extended from the sides, three on one side and three on the other.
2624	2	37	19	37	19	There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extended from the lampstand.
2625	2	37	20	37	20	And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals.
2626	2	37	21	37	21	A bud was under the first pair of branches that extended from the lampstand, a bud under the second pair, and a bud under the third pair.
2627	2	37	22	37	22	The buds and branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
2628	2	37	23	37	23	He also made its seven lamps, its wick trimmers, and trays of pure gold.
2629	2	37	24	37	24	He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
2630	2	37	25	37	25	He made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns were of one piece.
2631	2	37	26	37	26	And he overlaid with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns. Then he made a molding of gold around it.
2632	2	37	27	37	27	He made two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it.
2633	2	37	28	37	28	And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
2634	2	37	29	37	29	He also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.
2635	2	38	1	38	1	Bezalel constructed the altar of burnt offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.
2636	2	38	2	38	2	He made a horn at each of its four corners, so that the horns and altar were of one piece, and he overlaid the altar with bronze.
2637	2	38	3	38	3	He made all the altar’s utensils of bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks, and firepans.
2638	2	38	4	38	4	He made a grate of bronze mesh for the altar under its ledge, halfway up from the bottom.
2639	2	38	5	38	5	At the four corners of the bronze grate he cast four rings as holders for the poles.
2640	2	38	6	38	6	And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
2641	2	38	7	38	7	Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. He made the altar with boards so that it was hollow.
2642	2	38	8	38	8	Next, he made the bronze basin and its stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2643	2	38	9	38	9	Then he constructed the courtyard. The south side of the courtyard was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely spun linen,
2644	2	38	10	38	10	with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
2645	2	38	11	38	11	The north side was also a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.
2646	2	38	12	38	12	The west side was fifty cubits long and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver.
2647	2	38	13	38	13	And the east side, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits long.
2648	2	38	14	38	14	The curtains on one side of the entrance were fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.
2649	2	38	15	38	15	And the curtains on the other side were also fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases as well.
2650	2	38	16	38	16	All the curtains around the courtyard were made of finely spun linen.
2651	2	38	17	38	17	The bases for the posts were bronze, the hooks and bands were silver, and the plating for the tops of the posts was silver. So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with silver.
2652	2	38	18	38	18	The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,
2653	2	38	19	38	19	with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks were silver, as well as the bands and the plating of their tops.
2654	2	38	20	38	20	All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
2655	2	38	21	38	21	This is the inventory for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, as recorded at Moses’ command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
2656	2	38	22	38	22	Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD had commanded Moses.
2657	2	38	23	38	23	With him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.
2658	2	38	24	38	24	All the gold from the wave offering used for the work on the sanctuary totaled 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
2659	2	38	25	38	25	The silver from those numbered among the congregation totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel—
2660	2	38	26	38	26	a beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone twenty years of age or older who had crossed over to be numbered, a total of 603,550 men.
2661	2	38	27	38	27	The hundred talents of silver were used to cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the curtain—100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent per base.
2662	2	38	28	38	28	With the 1,775 shekels of silver he made the hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and supplied bands for them.
2663	2	38	29	38	29	The bronze from the wave offering totaled 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
2664	2	38	30	38	30	He used it to make the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its bronze grating, all the utensils for the altar,
2665	2	38	31	38	31	the bases for the surrounding courtyard and the gate of the courtyard, and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and the surrounding courtyard.
2666	2	39	1	39	1	From the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn they made specially woven garments for ministry in the sanctuary, as well as the holy garments for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2667	2	39	2	39	2	Bezalel made the ephod of finely spun linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
2668	2	39	3	39	3	They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut threads from them to interweave with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen—the work of a skilled craftsman.
2669	2	39	4	39	4	They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached at two of its corners, so it could be fastened.
2670	2	39	5	39	5	And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod was of one piece with the ephod, of the same workmanship—with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2671	2	39	6	39	6	They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraved like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
2672	2	39	7	39	7	Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2673	2	39	8	39	8	He also made the breastpiece with the same workmanship as the ephod, with gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen.
2674	2	39	9	39	9	It was square when folded over double, a span long and a span wide.
2675	2	39	10	39	10	And they mounted on it four rows of gemstones: The first row had a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald;
2676	2	39	11	39	11	the second row had a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
2677	2	39	12	39	12	the third row had a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
2678	2	39	13	39	13	and the fourth row had a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. These stones were mounted in gold filigree settings.
2679	2	39	14	39	14	The twelve stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel. Each stone was engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
2680	2	39	15	39	15	For the breastpiece they made braided chains like cords of pure gold.
2681	2	39	16	39	16	They also made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the two rings to the two corners of the breastpiece.
2682	2	39	17	39	17	Then they fastened the two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
2683	2	39	18	39	18	and they fastened the other ends of the two chains to the two filigree settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
2684	2	39	19	39	19	They made two more gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next to the ephod.
2685	2	39	20	39	20	They made two additional gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its front, near the seam just above its woven waistband.
2686	2	39	21	39	21	Then they tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece was above the waistband of the ephod and would not swing out from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2687	2	39	22	39	22	They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth, the work of a weaver,
2688	2	39	23	39	23	with an opening in the center of the robe like that of a garment, with a collar around the opening so that it would not tear.
2689	2	39	24	39	24	They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely spun linen on the lower hem of the robe.
2690	2	39	25	39	25	They also made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates,
2691	2	39	26	39	26	alternating the bells and pomegranates around the lower hem of the robe to be worn for ministry, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2692	2	39	27	39	27	For Aaron and his sons they made tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver,
2693	2	39	28	39	28	as well as the turban of fine linen, the ornate headbands and undergarments of finely spun linen,
2694	2	39	29	39	29	and the sash of finely spun linen, embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2695	2	39	30	39	30	They also made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and they engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.
2696	2	39	31	39	31	Then they fastened to it a blue cord to mount it on the turban, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2697	2	39	32	39	32	So all the work for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2698	2	39	33	39	33	Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent with all its furnishings, its clasps, its frames, its crossbars, and its posts and bases;
2699	2	39	34	39	34	the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the veil of the covering;
2700	2	39	35	39	35	the ark of the Testimony with its poles and the mercy seat;
2701	2	39	36	39	36	the table with all its utensils and the Bread of the Presence;
2702	2	39	37	39	37	the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its utensils, as well as the oil for the light;
2703	2	39	38	39	38	the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
2704	2	39	39	39	39	the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
2705	2	39	40	39	40	the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases; the curtain for the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and tent pegs, and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
2706	2	39	41	39	41	and the woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests.
2707	2	39	42	39	42	The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2708	2	39	43	39	43	And Moses inspected all the work and saw that they had accomplished it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
2709	2	40	1	40	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2710	2	40	2	40	2	“On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.
2711	2	40	3	40	3	Put the ark of the Testimony in it and screen off the ark with the veil.
2712	2	40	4	40	4	Then bring in the table and set out its arrangement; bring in the lampstand as well, and set up its lamps.
2713	2	40	5	40	5	Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2714	2	40	6	40	6	Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.
2715	2	40	7	40	7	And place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
2716	2	40	8	40	8	Set up the surrounding courtyard and hang the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard.
2717	2	40	9	40	9	Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it along with all its furnishings, and it shall be holy.
2718	2	40	10	40	10	Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it shall be most holy.
2719	2	40	11	40	11	Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
2720	2	40	12	40	12	Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
2721	2	40	13	40	13	And you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments, anoint him, and consecrate him, so that he may serve Me as a priest.
2722	2	40	14	40	14	Bring his sons forward and clothe them with tunics.
2723	2	40	15	40	15	Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”
2724	2	40	16	40	16	Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.
2725	2	40	17	40	17	So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year.
2726	2	40	18	40	18	When Moses set up the tabernacle, he laid its bases, positioned its frames, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts.
2727	2	40	19	40	19	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2728	2	40	20	40	20	Moses took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attaching the poles to the ark; and he set the mercy seat atop the ark.
2729	2	40	21	40	21	Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil for the screen, and shielded off the ark of the Testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2730	2	40	22	40	22	Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
2731	2	40	23	40	23	He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2732	2	40	24	40	24	He also placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
2733	2	40	25	40	25	and set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2734	2	40	26	40	26	Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting, in front of the veil,
2735	2	40	27	40	27	and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2736	2	40	28	40	28	Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
2737	2	40	29	40	29	He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2738	2	40	30	40	30	He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing;
2739	2	40	31	40	31	and from it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet.
2740	2	40	32	40	32	They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2741	2	40	33	40	33	And Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and he hung the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.
2742	2	40	34	40	34	Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
2743	2	40	35	40	35	Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
2744	2	40	36	40	36	Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out through all the stages of their journey.
2745	2	40	37	40	37	If the cloud was not lifted, they would not set out until the day it was taken up.
2746	2	40	38	40	38	For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel through all their journeys.
2747	3	1	1	1	1	Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting, saying,
2748	3	1	2	1	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, you may bring as your offering an animal from the herd or the flock.
2749	3	1	3	1	3	If one’s offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to offer an unblemished male. He must bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for its acceptance before the LORD.
2750	3	1	4	1	4	He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, so it can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
2751	3	1	5	1	5	And he shall slaughter the young bull before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests are to present the blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar that is at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2752	3	1	6	1	6	Next, he is to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces.
2753	3	1	7	1	7	The sons of Aaron the priest shall put a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
2754	3	1	8	1	8	Then Aaron’s sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, atop the burning wood on the altar.
2755	3	1	9	1	9	The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2756	3	1	10	1	10	If, however, one’s offering is a burnt offering from the flock—from the sheep or goats—he is to present an unblemished male.
2757	3	1	11	1	11	He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood against the altar on all sides.
2758	3	1	12	1	12	He is to cut the animal into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and fat, atop the burning wood that is on the altar.
2759	3	1	13	1	13	The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall bring all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2760	3	1	14	1	14	If, instead, one’s offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, he is to offer a turtledove or a young pigeon.
2761	3	1	15	1	15	Then the priest shall bring it to the altar, twist off its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar.
2762	3	1	16	1	16	And he is to remove the crop with its contents and throw it to the east side of the altar, in the place for ashes.
2763	3	1	17	1	17	He shall tear it open by its wings, without dividing the bird completely. And the priest is to burn it on the altar atop the burning wood. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.”
2764	3	2	1	2	1	“When anyone brings a grain offering to the LORD, his offering must consist of fine flour. He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it,
2765	3	2	2	2	2	and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2766	3	2	3	2	3	The remainder of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
2767	3	2	4	2	4	Now if you bring an offering of grain baked in an oven, it must consist of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil.
2768	3	2	5	2	5	If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil.
2769	3	2	6	2	6	Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
2770	3	2	7	2	7	If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan, it must consist of fine flour with oil.
2771	3	2	8	2	8	When you bring to the LORD the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he shall take it to the altar.
2772	3	2	9	2	9	The priest is to remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2773	3	2	10	2	10	But the remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
2774	3	2	11	2	11	No grain offering that you present to the LORD may be made with leaven, for you are not to burn any leaven or honey as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2775	3	2	12	2	12	You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
2776	3	2	13	2	13	And you shall season each of your grain offerings with salt; you must not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering—you are to add salt to each of your offerings.
2777	3	2	14	2	14	If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer crushed heads of new grain roasted on the fire.
2778	3	2	15	2	15	And you are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
2779	3	2	16	2	16	The priest shall then burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all its frankincense, as an offering made by fire to the LORD.”
2780	3	3	1	3	1	“If one’s offering is a peace offering and he offers an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he must present it without blemish before the LORD.
2781	3	3	2	3	2	He is to lay his hand on the head of the offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar.
2782	3	3	3	3	3	From the peace offering he is to bring an offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them,
2783	3	3	4	3	4	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys.
2784	3	3	5	3	5	Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar atop the burnt offering that is on the burning wood, as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2785	3	3	6	3	6	If, however, one’s peace offering to the LORD is from the flock, he must present a male or female without blemish.
2786	3	3	7	3	7	If he is presenting a lamb for his offering, he must present it before the LORD.
2787	3	3	8	3	8	He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
2788	3	3	9	3	9	And from the peace offering he shall bring an offering made by fire to the LORD consisting of its fat: the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them,
2789	3	3	10	3	10	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys.
2790	3	3	11	3	11	Then the priest is to burn them on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2791	3	3	12	3	12	If one’s offering is a goat, he is to present it before the LORD.
2792	3	3	13	3	13	He must lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
2793	3	3	14	3	14	And from his offering he shall present an offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them,
2794	3	3	15	3	15	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys.
2795	3	3	16	3	16	Then the priest is to burn the food on the altar as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma. All the fat is the LORD’s.
2796	3	3	17	3	17	This is a perpetual statute for the generations to come, wherever you live: You must not eat any fat or any blood.”
2797	3	4	1	4	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2798	3	4	2	4	2	“Tell the Israelites to do as follows with one who sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s commandments and does what is forbidden by them:
2799	3	4	3	4	3	If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.
2800	3	4	4	4	4	He must bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter it before the LORD.
2801	3	4	5	4	5	Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting.
2802	3	4	6	4	6	The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
2803	3	4	7	4	7	The priest must then apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. And he is to pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2804	3	4	8	4	8	Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them,
2805	3	4	9	4	9	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys—
2806	3	4	10	4	10	just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace offering. Then the priest shall then burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
2807	3	4	11	4	11	But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and legs and its entrails and dung—
2808	3	4	12	4	12	all the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he must burn it on a wood fire on the ash heap.
2809	3	4	13	4	13	Now if the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly so that they violate any of the LORD’s commandments and incur guilt by doing what is forbidden,
2810	3	4	14	4	14	when they become aware of the sin they have committed, then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting.
2811	3	4	15	4	15	The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the LORD, and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD.
2812	3	4	16	4	16	Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting,
2813	3	4	17	4	17	and he is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
2814	3	4	18	4	18	He is also to apply some of the blood to the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2815	3	4	19	4	19	And he is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.
2816	3	4	20	4	20	He shall offer this bull just as he did the bull for the sin offering; in this way the priest will make atonement on their behalf, and they will be forgiven.
2817	3	4	21	4	21	Then he is to take the bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burned the first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly.
2818	3	4	22	4	22	When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the commandments of the LORD his God, he incurs guilt.
2819	3	4	23	4	23	When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering.
2820	3	4	24	4	24	He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.
2821	3	4	25	4	25	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2822	3	4	26	4	26	He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the peace offerings; thus the priest will make atonement for that man’s sin, and he will be forgiven.
2823	3	4	27	4	27	And if one of the common people sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the LORD’s commandments, he incurs guilt.
2824	3	4	28	4	28	When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he is to bring a female goat without blemish as his offering for that sin.
2825	3	4	29	4	29	He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.
2826	3	4	30	4	30	Then the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger, apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2827	3	4	31	4	31	Then he shall remove all the fat just as it is removed from the peace offering, and the priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
2828	3	4	32	4	32	If, however, he brings a lamb as a sin offering, he is to bring an unblemished female.
2829	3	4	33	4	33	And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.
2830	3	4	34	4	34	Then the priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, apply it to the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
2831	3	4	35	4	35	And he is to remove all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the offerings made by fire to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.”
2832	3	5	1	5	1	“If someone sins by failing to testify when he hears a public charge about something he has witnessed, whether he has seen it or learned of it, he shall bear the iniquity.
2833	3	5	2	5	2	Or if a person touches anything unclean—whether the carcass of any unclean wild animal or livestock or crawling creature—even if he is unaware of it, he is unclean and guilty.
2834	3	5	3	5	3	Or if he touches human uncleanness—anything by which one becomes unclean—even if he is unaware of it, when he realizes it, he is guilty.
2835	3	5	4	5	4	Or if someone swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do anything good or evil—in whatever matter a man may rashly pronounce an oath—even if he is unaware of it, when he realizes it, he is guilty in the matter.
2836	3	5	5	5	5	If someone incurs guilt in one of these ways, he must confess the sin he has committed,
2837	3	5	6	5	6	and he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin he has committed: a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin.
2838	3	5	7	5	7	If, however, he cannot afford a lamb, he may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
2839	3	5	8	5	8	He is to bring them to the priest, who shall first present the one for the sin offering. He is to twist its head at the front of its neck without severing it;
2840	3	5	9	5	9	then he is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood is drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
2841	3	5	10	5	10	And the priest must prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
2842	3	5	11	5	11	But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it, because it is a sin offering.
2843	3	5	12	5	12	He is to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar atop the offerings made by fire to the LORD; it is a sin offering.
2844	3	5	13	5	13	In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed, and he will be forgiven. The remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.”
2845	3	5	14	5	14	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2846	3	5	15	5	15	“If someone acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s holy things, he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram from the flock, of proper value in silver shekels according to the sanctuary shekel; it is a guilt offering.
2847	3	5	16	5	16	Regarding any holy thing he has harmed, he must make restitution by adding a fifth of its value to it and giving it to the priest, who will make atonement on his behalf with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.
2848	3	5	17	5	17	If someone sins and violates any of the LORD’s commandments even though he was unaware, he is still guilty and shall bear his punishment.
2849	3	5	18	5	18	He must bring to the priest an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock as a guilt offering. Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the wrong he has committed in ignorance, and he will be forgiven.
2850	3	5	19	5	19	It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD.”
2851	3	5	20	6	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2852	3	5	21	6	2	“If someone sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him or stolen, or if he extorts his neighbor
2853	3	5	22	6	3	or finds lost property and lies about it and swears falsely, or if he commits any such sin that a man might commit—
2854	3	5	23	6	4	once he has sinned and becomes guilty, he must return what he has stolen or taken by extortion, or the deposit entrusted to him, or the lost property he found,
2855	3	5	24	6	5	or anything else about which he has sworn falsely. He must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the value, and pay it to the owner on the day he acknowledges his guilt.
2856	3	5	25	6	6	Then he must bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram of proper value from the flock.
2857	3	5	26	6	7	In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done to incur guilt.”
2858	3	6	1	6	8	Again the LORD said to Moses,
2859	3	6	2	6	9	“Command Aaron and his sons that this is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night, until morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar.
2860	3	6	3	6	10	And the priest shall put on his linen robe and linen undergarments, and he shall remove from the altar the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed and place them beside it.
2861	3	6	4	6	11	Then he must take off his garments, put on other clothes, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.
2862	3	6	5	6	12	The fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it must not be extinguished. Every morning the priest is to add wood to the fire, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat portions of the peace offerings on it.
2863	3	6	6	6	13	The fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it must not be extinguished.
2864	3	6	7	6	14	Now this is the law of the grain offering: Aaron’s sons shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar.
2865	3	6	8	6	15	The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil, together with all the frankincense from the grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2866	3	6	9	6	16	Aaron and his sons are to eat the remainder. It must be eaten without leaven in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
2867	3	6	10	6	17	It must not be baked with leaven; I have assigned it as their portion of My offerings made by fire. It is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
2868	3	6	11	6	18	Any male among the sons of Aaron may eat it. This is a permanent portion from the offerings made by fire to the LORD for the generations to come. Anything that touches them will become holy.”
2869	3	6	12	6	19	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2870	3	6	13	6	20	“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
2871	3	6	14	6	21	It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle; you are to bring it well-kneaded and present it as a grain offering broken in pieces, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
2872	3	6	15	6	22	The priest, who is one of Aaron’s sons and will be anointed to take his place, is to prepare it. As a permanent portion for the LORD, it must be burned completely.
2873	3	6	16	6	23	Every grain offering for a priest shall be burned completely; it is not to be eaten.”
2874	3	6	17	6	24	And the LORD said to Moses,
2875	3	6	18	6	25	“Tell Aaron and his sons that this is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall be slaughtered before the LORD; it is most holy.
2876	3	6	19	6	26	The priest who offers it shall eat it; it must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
2877	3	6	20	6	27	Anything that touches its flesh will become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in a holy place.
2878	3	6	21	6	28	The clay pot in which the sin offering is boiled must be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured and rinsed with water.
2879	3	6	22	6	29	Any male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy.
2880	3	6	23	6	30	But no sin offering may be eaten if its blood has been brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it must be burned.”
2881	3	7	1	7	1	“Now this is the law of the guilt offering, which is most holy:
2882	3	7	2	7	2	The guilt offering must be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
2883	3	7	3	7	3	And all the fat from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
2884	3	7	4	7	4	both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
2885	3	7	5	7	5	The priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
2886	3	7	6	7	6	Every male among the priests may eat of it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
2887	3	7	7	7	7	The guilt offering is like the sin offering; the same law applies to both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.
2888	3	7	8	7	8	As for the priest who presents a burnt offering for anyone, the hide of that offering belongs to him.
2889	3	7	9	7	9	Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it,
2890	3	7	10	7	10	and every grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.
2891	3	7	11	7	11	Now this is the law of the peace offering that one may present to the LORD:
2892	3	7	12	7	12	If he offers it in thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, he must offer unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.
2893	3	7	13	7	13	Along with his peace offering of thanksgiving, he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened bread.
2894	3	7	14	7	14	From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.
2895	3	7	15	7	15	The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day he offers it; none of it may be left until morning.
2896	3	7	16	7	16	If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, but the remainder may be eaten on the next day.
2897	3	7	17	7	17	But any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day must be burned up.
2898	3	7	18	7	18	If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presented it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
2899	3	7	19	7	19	Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. As for any other meat, anyone who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
2900	3	7	20	7	20	But if anyone who is unclean eats meat from the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.
2901	3	7	21	7	21	If one touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable thing, and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.”
2902	3	7	22	7	22	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2903	3	7	23	7	23	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat.
2904	3	7	24	7	24	The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by wild beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.
2905	3	7	25	7	25	If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which an offering by fire may be presented to the LORD, the one who eats it must be cut off from his people.
2906	3	7	26	7	26	You must not eat the blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings.
2907	3	7	27	7	27	If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’”
2908	3	7	28	7	28	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2909	3	7	29	7	29	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to the LORD must bring it as his sacrifice to the LORD.
2910	3	7	30	7	30	With his own hands he is to bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD; he shall bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast as a wave offering before the LORD.
2911	3	7	31	7	31	The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
2912	3	7	32	7	32	And you are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace offering.
2913	3	7	33	7	33	The son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering shall have the right thigh as a portion.
2914	3	7	34	7	34	I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’”
2915	3	7	35	7	35	This is the portion of the offerings made by fire to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
2916	3	7	36	7	36	On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that this be given them by the sons of Israel. It is a permanent portion for the generations to come.
2917	3	7	37	7	37	This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering,
2918	3	7	38	7	38	which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.
2919	3	8	1	8	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
2920	3	8	2	8	2	“Take Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
2921	3	8	3	8	3	and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.”
2922	3	8	4	8	4	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
2923	3	8	5	8	5	And Moses said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded to be done.”
2924	3	8	6	8	6	Then Moses presented Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
2925	3	8	7	8	7	He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He tied the woven band of the ephod around him and fastened it to him.
2926	3	8	8	8	8	Then he put the breastpiece on him and placed the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
2927	3	8	9	8	9	Moses also put the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban, as the LORD had commanded him.
2928	3	8	10	8	10	Next, Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it; and so he consecrated them.
2929	3	8	11	8	11	He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
2930	3	8	12	8	12	He also poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.
2931	3	8	13	8	13	Then Moses presented Aaron’s sons, put tunics on them, wrapped sashes around them, and tied headbands on them, just as the LORD had commanded him.
2932	3	8	14	8	14	Moses then brought the bull near for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
2933	3	8	15	8	15	Moses slaughtered the bull, took some of the blood, and applied it with his finger to all four horns of the altar, purifying the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it so that atonement could be made on it.
2934	3	8	16	8	16	Moses also took all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it all on the altar.
2935	3	8	17	8	17	But the bull with its hide, flesh, and dung he burned outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded him.
2936	3	8	18	8	18	Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
2937	3	8	19	8	19	Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
2938	3	8	20	8	20	He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.
2939	3	8	21	8	21	He washed the entrails and legs with water and burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2940	3	8	22	8	22	After that, Moses presented the other ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
2941	3	8	23	8	23	Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right earlobe, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
2942	3	8	24	8	24	Moses also presented Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar.
2943	3	8	25	8	25	And Moses took the fat—the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat—as well as the right thigh.
2944	3	8	26	8	26	And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one cake of unleavened bread, one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer, and he placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
2945	3	8	27	8	27	He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering.
2946	3	8	28	8	28	Then Moses took these out of their hands and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
2947	3	8	29	8	29	He also took the breast—Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination—and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD had commanded him.
2948	3	8	30	8	30	Next Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments, as well as Aaron’s sons and their garments.
2949	3	8	31	8	31	And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’
2950	3	8	32	8	32	Then you must burn up the remainder of the meat and bread.
2951	3	8	33	8	33	You must not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are complete; for it will take seven days to ordain you.
2952	3	8	34	8	34	What has been done today has been commanded by the LORD in order to make atonement on your behalf.
2953	3	8	35	8	35	You must remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and keep the LORD’s charge so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded.”
2954	3	8	36	8	36	So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses.
2955	3	9	1	9	1	On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
2956	3	9	2	9	2	He said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before the LORD.
2957	3	9	3	9	3	Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without blemish—for a burnt offering,
2958	3	9	4	9	4	an ox and a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.’”
2959	3	9	5	9	5	So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the whole congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
2960	3	9	6	9	6	And Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”
2961	3	9	7	9	7	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to make atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s offering to make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.”
2962	3	9	8	9	8	So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
2963	3	9	9	9	9	The sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
2964	3	9	10	9	10	On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
2965	3	9	11	9	11	But he burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp.
2966	3	9	12	9	12	Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
2967	3	9	13	9	13	They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
2968	3	9	14	9	14	He washed the entrails and the legs and burned them atop the burnt offering on the altar.
2969	3	9	15	9	15	Aaron then presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin like the first one.
2970	3	9	16	9	16	He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
2971	3	9	17	9	17	Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.
2972	3	9	18	9	18	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
2973	3	9	19	9	19	They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver—
2974	3	9	20	9	20	and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,
2975	3	9	21	9	21	but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses had commanded.
2976	3	9	22	9	22	Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down.
2977	3	9	23	9	23	Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
2978	3	9	24	9	24	Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
2979	3	10	1	10	1	Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense, and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to His command.
2980	3	10	2	10	2	So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died in the presence of the LORD.
2981	3	10	3	10	3	Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD meant when He said: ‘To those who come near Me I will show My holiness, and in the sight of all the people I will reveal My glory.’” But Aaron remained silent.
2982	3	10	4	10	4	Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry the bodies of your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”
2983	3	10	5	10	5	So they came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had directed.
2984	3	10	6	10	6	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become disheveled and do not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will be angry with the whole congregation. But your brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that the LORD has ignited.
2985	3	10	7	10	7	You shall not go outside the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or you will die, for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses instructed.
2986	3	10	8	10	8	Then the LORD said to Aaron,
2987	3	10	9	10	9	“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when you enter the Tent of Meeting, or else you will die; this is a perpetual statute for the generations to come.
2988	3	10	10	10	10	You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean,
2989	3	10	11	10	11	so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given them through Moses.”
2990	3	10	12	10	12	And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings made by fire to the LORD and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is most holy.
2991	3	10	13	10	13	You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the offerings made by fire to the LORD; for this is what I have been commanded.
2992	3	10	14	10	14	And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
2993	3	10	15	10	15	They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD has commanded.”
2994	3	10	16	10	16	Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,
2995	3	10	17	10	17	“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before the LORD.
2996	3	10	18	10	18	Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”
2997	3	10	19	10	19	But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the LORD’s sight?”
2998	3	10	20	10	20	And when Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied.
2999	3	11	1	11	1	The LORD spoke again to Moses and Aaron, telling them,
3000	3	11	2	11	2	“Say to the Israelites, ‘Of all the beasts of the earth, these ones you may eat:
3001	3	11	3	11	3	You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.
3002	3	11	4	11	4	But of those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof, you are not to eat the following: The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.
3003	3	11	5	11	5	The rock badger, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.
3004	3	11	6	11	6	The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean for you.
3005	3	11	7	11	7	And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.
3006	3	11	8	11	8	You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.
3007	3	11	9	11	9	Of all the creatures that live in the water, whether in the seas or in the streams, you may eat anything with fins and scales.
3008	3	11	10	11	10	But the following among all the teeming life and creatures in the water are detestable to you: everything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales.
3009	3	11	11	11	11	They shall be an abomination to you; you must not eat their meat, and you must detest their carcasses.
3010	3	11	12	11	12	Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales shall be detestable to you.
3011	3	11	13	11	13	Additionally, you are to detest the following birds, and they must not be eaten because they are detestable: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
3012	3	11	14	11	14	the kite, any kind of falcon,
3013	3	11	15	11	15	any kind of raven,
3014	3	11	16	11	16	the ostrich, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
3015	3	11	17	11	17	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
3016	3	11	18	11	18	the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
3017	3	11	19	11	19	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
3018	3	11	20	11	20	All flying insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
3019	3	11	21	11	21	However, you may eat the following kinds of winged creatures that walk on all fours: those having jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground.
3020	3	11	22	11	22	Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper.
3021	3	11	23	11	23	All other winged creatures that have four legs are detestable to you.
3022	3	11	24	11	24	These creatures will make you unclean. Whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening,
3023	3	11	25	11	25	and whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening.
3024	3	11	26	11	26	Every animal with hooves not completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you. Whoever touches any of them will be unclean.
3025	3	11	27	11	27	All the four-footed animals that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening,
3026	3	11	28	11	28	and anyone who picks up a carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening. They are unclean for you.
3027	3	11	29	11	29	The following creatures that move along the ground are unclean for you: the mole, the mouse, any kind of great lizard,
3028	3	11	30	11	30	the gecko, the monitor lizard, the common lizard, the skink, and the chameleon.
3029	3	11	31	11	31	These animals are unclean for you among all the crawling creatures. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.
3030	3	11	32	11	32	When one of them dies and falls on something, that article becomes unclean; any article of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth, or any implement used for work must be rinsed with water and will remain unclean until evening; then it will be clean.
3031	3	11	33	11	33	If any of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean; you must break the pot.
3032	3	11	34	11	34	Any food coming into contact with water from that pot will be unclean, and any drink in such a container will be unclean.
3033	3	11	35	11	35	Anything upon which one of their carcasses falls will be unclean. If it is an oven or cooking pot, it must be smashed; it is unclean and will remain unclean for you.
3034	3	11	36	11	36	Nevertheless, a spring or cistern containing water will remain clean, but one who touches a carcass in it will be unclean.
3035	3	11	37	11	37	If a carcass falls on any seed for sowing, the seed is clean;
3036	3	11	38	11	38	but if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you.
3037	3	11	39	11	39	If an animal that you may eat dies, anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean until evening.
3038	3	11	40	11	40	Anyone who eats from the carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening, and anyone who picks up the carcass must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening.
3039	3	11	41	11	41	Every creature that moves along the ground is detestable; it must not be eaten.
3040	3	11	42	11	42	Do not eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it crawls on its belly or walks on four or more feet; for such creatures are detestable.
3041	3	11	43	11	43	Do not defile yourselves by any crawling creature; do not become unclean or defiled by them.
3042	3	11	44	11	44	For I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, because I am holy. You must not defile yourselves by any creature that crawls along the ground.
3043	3	11	45	11	45	For I am the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt so that I would be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy.
3044	3	11	46	11	46	This is the law regarding animals, birds, all living creatures that move in the water, and all creatures that crawl along the ground.
3045	3	11	47	11	47	You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between animals that may be eaten and those that may not.’”
3046	3	12	1	12	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3047	3	12	2	12	2	“Say to the Israelites, ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be unclean for seven days, as she is during the days of her menstruation.
3048	3	12	3	12	3	And on the eighth day the flesh of the boy’s foreskin is to be circumcised.
3049	3	12	4	12	4	The woman shall continue in purification from her bleeding for thirty-three days. She must not touch anything sacred or go into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are complete.
3050	3	12	5	12	5	If, however, she gives birth to a daughter, the woman will be unclean for two weeks as she is during her menstruation. Then she must continue in purification from her bleeding for sixty-six days.
3051	3	12	6	12	6	When the days of her purification are complete, whether for a son or for a daughter, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
3052	3	12	7	12	7	And the priest will present them before the LORD and make atonement for her; and she shall be ceremonially cleansed from her flow of blood. This is the law for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or to a female.
3053	3	12	8	12	8	But if she cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”
3054	3	13	1	13	1	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
3055	3	13	2	13	2	“When someone has a swelling or rash or bright spot on his skin that could become an infectious skin disease, he must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who is a priest.
3056	3	13	3	13	3	The priest is to examine the infection on his skin, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a skin disease. After the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean.
3057	3	13	4	13	4	If, however, the spot on his skin is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.
3058	3	13	5	13	5	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him, and if he sees that the infection is unchanged and has not spread on the skin, the priest must isolate him for another seven days.
3059	3	13	6	13	6	The priest will examine him again on the seventh day, and if the sore has faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a rash. The person must wash his clothes and be clean.
3060	3	13	7	13	7	But if the rash spreads further on his skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he must present himself again to the priest.
3061	3	13	8	13	8	The priest will reexamine him, and if the rash has spread on the skin, then the priest must pronounce him unclean; he has a skin disease.
3062	3	13	9	13	9	When anyone develops a skin disease, he must be brought to the priest.
3063	3	13	10	13	10	The priest will examine him, and if there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
3064	3	13	11	13	11	it is a chronic skin disease and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He need not isolate him, for he is unclean.
3065	3	13	12	13	12	But if the skin disease breaks out all over his skin so that it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to foot, as far as the priest can see,
3066	3	13	13	13	13	the priest shall examine him, and if the disease has covered his entire body, he is to pronounce the infected person clean. Since it has all turned white, he is clean.
3067	3	13	14	13	14	But whenever raw flesh appears on someone, he will be unclean.
3068	3	13	15	13	15	When the priest sees the raw flesh, he must pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is a skin disease.
3069	3	13	16	13	16	But if the raw flesh changes and turns white, he must go to the priest.
3070	3	13	17	13	17	The priest will reexamine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest is to pronounce the infected person clean; then he is clean.
3071	3	13	18	13	18	When a boil appears on someone’s skin and it heals,
3072	3	13	19	13	19	and a white swelling or a reddish-white spot develops where the boil was, he must present himself to the priest.
3073	3	13	20	13	20	The priest shall examine it, and if it appears to be beneath the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection that has broken out in the boil.
3074	3	13	21	13	21	But when the priest examines it, if there is no white hair in it, and it is not beneath the skin and has faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days.
3075	3	13	22	13	22	If it spreads any further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is an infection.
3076	3	13	23	13	23	But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
3077	3	13	24	13	24	When there is a burn on someone’s skin and the raw area of the burn becomes reddish-white or white,
3078	3	13	25	13	25	the priest must examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and the spot appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a disease that has broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection.
3079	3	13	26	13	26	But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the spot, and it is not beneath the skin but has faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days.
3080	3	13	27	13	27	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him, and if it has spread further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection.
3081	3	13	28	13	28	But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread on the skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest is to pronounce him clean; for it is only the scar from the burn.
3082	3	13	29	13	29	If a man or woman has an infection on the head or chin,
3083	3	13	30	13	30	the priest shall examine the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a scaly outbreak, an infectious disease of the head or chin.
3084	3	13	31	13	31	But if the priest examines the scaly infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.
3085	3	13	32	13	32	On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine the infection, and if the scaly outbreak has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
3086	3	13	33	13	33	then the person must shave himself except for the scaly area. Then the priest shall isolate him for another seven days.
3087	3	13	34	13	34	On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scaly outbreak, and if it has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, the priest is to pronounce him clean. He must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.
3088	3	13	35	13	35	If, however, the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing,
3089	3	13	36	13	36	the priest is to examine him, and if the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for yellow hair; the person is unclean.
3090	3	13	37	13	37	But if in his sight the scaly outbreak is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has healed. He is clean, and the priest is to pronounce him clean.
3091	3	13	38	13	38	When a man or a woman has white spots on the skin,
3092	3	13	39	13	39	the priest shall examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; the person is clean.
3093	3	13	40	13	40	Now if a man loses his hair and is bald, he is still clean.
3094	3	13	41	13	41	Or if his hairline recedes and he is bald on his forehead, he is still clean.
3095	3	13	42	13	42	But if there is a reddish-white sore on the bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease breaking out on it.
3096	3	13	43	13	43	The priest is to examine him, and if the swelling of the infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white like a skin disease,
3097	3	13	44	13	44	the man is diseased; he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean because of the infection on his head.
3098	3	13	45	13	45	A diseased person must wear torn clothes and let his hair hang loose, and he must cover his mouth and cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’
3099	3	13	46	13	46	As long as he has the infection, he remains unclean. He must live alone in a place outside the camp.
3100	3	13	47	13	47	If any fabric is contaminated with mildew—any wool or linen garment,
3101	3	13	48	13	48	any weave or knit of linen or wool, or any article of leather—
3102	3	13	49	13	49	and if the mark in the fabric, leather, weave, knit, or leather article is green or red, then it is contaminated with mildew and must be shown to the priest.
3103	3	13	50	13	50	And the priest is to examine the mildew and isolate the contaminated fabric for seven days.
3104	3	13	51	13	51	On the seventh day the priest shall reexamine it, and if the mildew has spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather, then regardless of how it is used, it is a harmful mildew; the article is unclean.
3105	3	13	52	13	52	He is to burn the fabric, weave, or knit, whether the contaminated item is wool or linen or leather. Since the mildew is harmful, the article must be burned up.
3106	3	13	53	13	53	But when the priest reexamines it, if the mildew has not spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather article,
3107	3	13	54	13	54	the priest is to order the contaminated article to be washed and isolated for another seven days.
3108	3	13	55	13	55	After it has been washed, the priest is to reexamine it, and if the mildewed article has not changed in appearance, it is unclean. Even though the mildew has not spread, you must burn it, whether the rot is on the front or back.
3109	3	13	56	13	56	If the priest examines it and the mildew has faded after it has been washed, he must cut the contaminated section out of the fabric, leather, weave, or knit.
3110	3	13	57	13	57	But if it reappears in the fabric, weave or knit, or on any leather article, it is spreading. You must burn the contaminated article.
3111	3	13	58	13	58	If the mildew disappears from the fabric, weave or knit, or any leather article after washing, then it is to be washed again, and it will be clean.
3112	3	13	59	13	59	This is the law concerning a mildew contamination in wool or linen fabric, weave or knit, or any leather article, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.”
3113	3	14	1	14	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3114	3	14	2	14	2	“This is the law of the one afflicted with a skin disease on the day of his cleansing, when he is brought to the priest.
3115	3	14	3	14	3	The priest is to go outside the camp to examine him, and if the skin disease of the afflicted person has healed,
3116	3	14	4	14	4	the priest shall order that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed.
3117	3	14	5	14	5	Then the priest shall command that one of the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in a clay pot.
3118	3	14	6	14	6	And he is to take the live bird together with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the fresh water.
3119	3	14	7	14	7	Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the skin disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and release the live bird into the open field.
3120	3	14	8	14	8	The one being cleansed must wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe with water; then he will be ceremonially clean. Afterward, he may enter the camp, but he must remain outside his tent for seven days.
3121	3	14	9	14	9	On the seventh day he must shave off all his hair—his head, his beard, his eyebrows, and the rest of his hair. He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and he will be clean.
3122	3	14	10	14	10	On the eighth day he is to bring two unblemished male lambs, an unblemished ewe lamb a year old, a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil, and one log of olive oil.
3123	3	14	11	14	11	The priest who performs the cleansing shall present the one to be cleansed, together with these offerings, before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3124	3	14	12	14	12	Then the priest is to take one of the male lambs and present it as a guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil; and he must wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
3125	3	14	13	14	13	Then he is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy.
3126	3	14	14	14	14	The priest is to take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3127	3	14	15	14	15	Then the priest shall take some of the log of olive oil, pour it into his left palm,
3128	3	14	16	14	16	dip his right forefinger into the oil in his left palm, and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.
3129	3	14	17	14	17	And the priest is to put some of the oil remaining in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.
3130	3	14	18	14	18	The rest of the oil in his palm, the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.
3131	3	14	19	14	19	Then the priest is to sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt offering
3132	3	14	20	14	20	and offer it on the altar, with the grain offering, to make atonement for him, and he will be clean.
3133	3	14	21	14	21	If, however, the person is poor and cannot afford these offerings, he is to take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for him, along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a log of olive oil,
3134	3	14	22	14	22	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever he can afford, one to be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
3135	3	14	23	14	23	On the eighth day he is to bring them for his cleansing to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD.
3136	3	14	24	14	24	The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering, along with the log of olive oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD.
3137	3	14	25	14	25	And after he slaughters the lamb for the guilt offering, the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
3138	3	14	26	14	26	Then the priest is to pour some of the oil into his left palm
3139	3	14	27	14	27	and sprinkle with his right forefinger some of the oil in his left palm seven times before the LORD.
3140	3	14	28	14	28	The priest shall also put some of the oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot—on the same places as the blood of the guilt offering.
3141	3	14	29	14	29	The rest of the oil in his palm, the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD.
3142	3	14	30	14	30	Then he must sacrifice one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, whichever he can afford,
3143	3	14	31	14	31	one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. In this way the priest will make atonement before the LORD for the one to be cleansed.
3144	3	14	32	14	32	This is the law for someone who has a skin disease and cannot afford the cost of his cleansing.”
3145	3	14	33	14	33	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
3146	3	14	34	14	34	“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a contamination of mildew into a house in that land,
3147	3	14	35	14	35	the owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘Something like mildew has appeared in my house.’
3148	3	14	36	14	36	The priest must order that the house be cleared before he enters it to examine the mildew, so that nothing in the house will become unclean. After this, the priest shall go in to inspect the house.
3149	3	14	37	14	37	He is to examine the house, and if the mildew on the walls consists of green or red depressions that appear to be beneath the surface of the wall,
3150	3	14	38	14	38	the priest shall go outside the doorway of the house and close it up for seven days.
3151	3	14	39	14	39	On the seventh day the priest is to return and inspect the house. If the mildew has spread on the walls,
3152	3	14	40	14	40	he must order that the contaminated stones be pulled out and thrown into an unclean place outside the city.
3153	3	14	41	14	41	And he shall have the inside of the house scraped completely and the plaster that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the city.
3154	3	14	42	14	42	So different stones must be obtained to replace the contaminated ones, as well as additional mortar to replaster the house.
3155	3	14	43	14	43	If the mildew reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house has been scraped and replastered,
3156	3	14	44	14	44	the priest must come and inspect it. If the mildew has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew; the house is unclean.
3157	3	14	45	14	45	It must be torn down with its stones, its timbers, and all its plaster, and taken outside the city to an unclean place.
3158	3	14	46	14	46	Anyone who enters the house during any of the days that it is closed up will be unclean until evening.
3159	3	14	47	14	47	And anyone who sleeps in the house or eats in it must wash his clothes.
3160	3	14	48	14	48	If, however, the priest comes and inspects it, and the mildew has not spread after the house has been replastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the mildew is gone.
3161	3	14	49	14	49	He is to take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop to purify the house;
3162	3	14	50	14	50	and he shall slaughter one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.
3163	3	14	51	14	51	Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
3164	3	14	52	14	52	And he shall cleanse the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn.
3165	3	14	53	14	53	Finally, he is to release the live bird into the open fields outside the city. In this way he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.
3166	3	14	54	14	54	This is the law for any infectious skin disease, for a scaly outbreak,
3167	3	14	55	14	55	for mildew in clothing or in a house,
3168	3	14	56	14	56	and for a swelling, rash, or spot,
3169	3	14	57	14	57	to determine when something is clean or unclean. This is the law regarding skin diseases and mildew.”
3170	3	15	1	15	1	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
3171	3	15	2	15	2	“Say to the Israelites, ‘When any man has a bodily discharge, the discharge is unclean.
3172	3	15	3	15	3	This uncleanness is from his discharge, whether his body allows the discharge to flow or blocks it. So his discharge will bring about uncleanness.
3173	3	15	4	15	4	Any bed on which the man with the discharge lies will be unclean, and any furniture on which he sits will be unclean.
3174	3	15	5	15	5	Anyone who touches his bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3175	3	15	6	15	6	Whoever sits on furniture on which the man with the discharge was sitting must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3176	3	15	7	15	7	Whoever touches the body of the man with a discharge must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3177	3	15	8	15	8	If the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, that person must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3178	3	15	9	15	9	Any saddle on which the man with the discharge rides will be unclean.
3179	3	15	10	15	10	Whoever touches anything that was under him will be unclean until evening, and whoever carries such things must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3180	3	15	11	15	11	If the man with the discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands with water, the one who was touched must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3181	3	15	12	15	12	Any clay pot that the man with the discharge touches must be broken, and any wooden utensil must be rinsed with water.
3182	3	15	13	15	13	When the man has been cleansed from his discharge, he must count off seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe himself in fresh water, and he shall be clean.
3183	3	15	14	15	14	On the eighth day he is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, come before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and give them to the priest.
3184	3	15	15	15	15	The priest is to sacrifice them, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the man before the LORD because of his discharge.
3185	3	15	16	15	16	When a man has an emission of semen, he must bathe his whole body with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3186	3	15	17	15	17	Any clothing or leather on which there is an emission of semen must be washed with water, and it will remain unclean until evening.
3187	3	15	18	15	18	If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, both must bathe with water, and they will remain unclean until evening.
3188	3	15	19	15	19	When a woman has a discharge consisting of blood from her body, she will be unclean due to her menstruation for seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening.
3189	3	15	20	15	20	Anything on which she lies or sits during her menstruation will be unclean,
3190	3	15	21	15	21	and anyone who touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3191	3	15	22	15	22	Whoever touches any furniture on which she was sitting must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3192	3	15	23	15	23	And whether it is a bed or furniture on which she was sitting, whoever touches it will be unclean until evening.
3193	3	15	24	15	24	If a man lies with her and her menstrual flow touches him, he will be unclean for seven days, and any bed on which he lies will become unclean.
3194	3	15	25	15	25	When a woman has a discharge of her blood for many days at a time other than her menstrual period, or if it continues beyond her period, she will be unclean all the days of her unclean discharge, just as she is during the days of her menstruation.
3195	3	15	26	15	26	Any bed on which she lies or any furniture on which she sits during the days of her discharge will be unclean, like her bed during her menstrual period.
3196	3	15	27	15	27	Anyone who touches these things will be unclean; he must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening.
3197	3	15	28	15	28	When a woman is cleansed of her discharge, she must count off seven days, and after that she will be ceremonially clean.
3198	3	15	29	15	29	On the eighth day she is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3199	3	15	30	15	30	The priest is to sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge.
3200	3	15	31	15	31	You must keep the children of Israel separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not die by defiling My tabernacle, which is among them.
3201	3	15	32	15	32	This is the law of him who has a discharge, of the man who has a seminal emission whereby he is unclean,
3202	3	15	33	15	33	of a woman in her menstrual period, of any male or female who has a discharge, and of a man who lies with an unclean woman.’”
3203	3	16	1	16	1	Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of two of Aaron’s sons when they approached the presence of the LORD.
3204	3	16	2	16	2	And the LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron not to enter freely into the Most Holy Place behind the veil in front of the mercy seat on the ark, or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat.
3205	3	16	3	16	3	This is how Aaron is to enter the Holy Place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
3206	3	16	4	16	4	He is to wear the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments. He must tie a linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are sacred garments, and he must bathe himself with water before he wears them.
3207	3	16	5	16	5	And he shall take from the congregation of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
3208	3	16	6	16	6	Aaron is to present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household.
3209	3	16	7	16	7	Then he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3210	3	16	8	16	8	After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat,
3211	3	16	9	16	9	he shall present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
3212	3	16	10	16	10	But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement by sending it into the wilderness as the scapegoat.
3213	3	16	11	16	11	When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
3214	3	16	12	16	12	Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and take them inside the veil.
3215	3	16	13	16	13	He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the Testimony, so that he will not die.
3216	3	16	14	16	14	And he is to take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the mercy seat.
3217	3	16	15	16	15	Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and bring its blood behind the veil, and with its blood he must do as he did with the bull’s blood: He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it.
3218	3	16	16	16	16	So he shall make atonement for the Most Holy Place because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting which abides among them, because it is surrounded by their impurities.
3219	3	16	17	16	17	No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he leaves, after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel.
3220	3	16	18	16	18	Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
3221	3	16	19	16	19	He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.
3222	3	16	20	16	20	When Aaron has finished purifying the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he is to bring forward the live goat.
3223	3	16	21	16	21	Then he is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task.
3224	3	16	22	16	22	The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place, and the man will release it into the wilderness.
3225	3	16	23	16	23	Then Aaron is to enter the Tent of Meeting, take off the linen garments he put on before entering the Most Holy Place, and leave them there.
3226	3	16	24	16	24	He is to bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his own clothes. Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering to make atonement for himself and for the people.
3227	3	16	25	16	25	He is also to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
3228	3	16	26	16	26	The man who released the goat as the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water; afterward he may reenter the camp.
3229	3	16	27	16	27	The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; and their hides, flesh, and dung must be burned up.
3230	3	16	28	16	28	The one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and afterward he may reenter the camp.
3231	3	16	29	16	29	This is to be a permanent statute for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall humble yourselves and not do any work—whether the native or the foreigner who resides among you—
3232	3	16	30	16	30	because on this day atonement will be made for you to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
3233	3	16	31	16	31	It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble yourselves; it is a permanent statute.
3234	3	16	32	16	32	The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest shall make atonement. He will put on the sacred linen garments
3235	3	16	33	16	33	and make atonement for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, and for the priests and all the people of the assembly.
3236	3	16	34	16	34	This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement once a year for the Israelites because of all their sins.” And all this was done as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3237	3	17	1	17	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3238	3	17	2	17	2	“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and tell them this is what the LORD has commanded:
3239	3	17	3	17	3	‘Anyone from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp or outside of it
3240	3	17	4	17	4	instead of bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD before His tabernacle—that man shall incur bloodguilt. He has shed blood and must be cut off from his people.
3241	3	17	5	17	5	For this reason the Israelites will bring to the LORD the sacrifices they have been offering in the open fields. They are to bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and offer them as sacrifices of peace to the LORD.
3242	3	17	6	17	6	The priest will then sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3243	3	17	7	17	7	They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons to which they have prostituted themselves. This will be a permanent statute for them for the generations to come.’
3244	3	17	8	17	8	Tell them that if anyone from the house of Israel or any foreigner living among them offers a burnt offering or a sacrifice
3245	3	17	9	17	9	but does not bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to the LORD, that man must be cut off from his people.
3246	3	17	10	17	10	If anyone from the house of Israel or a foreigner living among them eats any blood, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from among his people.
3247	3	17	11	17	11	For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls upon the altar; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
3248	3	17	12	17	12	Therefore I say to the Israelites, ‘None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner living among you eat blood.’
3249	3	17	13	17	13	And if any Israelite or foreigner living among them hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten, he must drain its blood and cover it with dirt.
3250	3	17	14	17	14	For the life of all flesh is its blood. Therefore I have told the Israelites, ‘You must not eat the blood of any living thing, because the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off.’
3251	3	17	15	17	15	And any person, whether native or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening; then he will be clean.
3252	3	17	16	17	16	But if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself, then he shall bear his iniquity.”
3253	3	18	1	18	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3254	3	18	2	18	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God.
3255	3	18	3	18	3	You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs.
3256	3	18	4	18	4	You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God.
3257	3	18	5	18	5	Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD.
3258	3	18	6	18	6	None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.
3259	3	18	7	18	7	You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.
3260	3	18	8	18	8	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father.
3261	3	18	9	18	9	You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.
3262	3	18	10	18	10	You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family.
3263	3	18	11	18	11	You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.
3264	3	18	12	18	12	You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.
3265	3	18	13	18	13	You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative.
3266	3	18	14	18	14	You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt.
3267	3	18	15	18	15	You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sexual relations with her.
3268	3	18	16	18	16	You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother.
3269	3	18	17	18	17	You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.
3270	3	18	18	18	18	You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.
3271	3	18	19	18	19	You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period.
3272	3	18	20	18	20	You must not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife and thus defile yourself with her.
3273	3	18	21	18	21	You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
3274	3	18	22	18	22	You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination.
3275	3	18	23	18	23	You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion.
3276	3	18	24	18	24	Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves.
3277	3	18	25	18	25	Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.
3278	3	18	26	18	26	But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you.
3279	3	18	27	18	27	For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled.
3280	3	18	28	18	28	So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you.
3281	3	18	29	18	29	Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people.
3282	3	18	30	18	30	You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.”
3283	3	19	1	19	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3284	3	19	2	19	2	“Speak to the whole congregation of Israel and tell them: Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.
3285	3	19	3	19	3	Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you must keep My Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God.
3286	3	19	4	19	4	Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods. I am the LORD your God.
3287	3	19	5	19	5	When you sacrifice a peace offering to the LORD, you shall offer it for your acceptance.
3288	3	19	6	19	6	It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains on the third day must be burned up.
3289	3	19	7	19	7	If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is tainted and will not be accepted.
3290	3	19	8	19	8	Whoever eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person must be cut off from his people.
3291	3	19	9	19	9	When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
3292	3	19	10	19	10	You must not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the LORD your God.
3293	3	19	11	19	11	You must not steal. You must not lie or deceive one another.
3294	3	19	12	19	12	You must not swear falsely by My name and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
3295	3	19	13	19	13	You must not defraud your neighbor or rob him. You must not withhold until morning the wages due a hired hand.
3296	3	19	14	19	14	You must not curse the deaf or place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the LORD.
3297	3	19	15	19	15	You must not pervert justice; you must not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the rich; you are to judge your neighbor fairly.
3298	3	19	16	19	16	You must not go about spreading slander among your people. You must not endanger the life of your neighbor. I am the LORD.
3299	3	19	17	19	17	You must not harbor hatred against your brother in your heart. Directly rebuke your neighbor, so that you will not incur guilt on account of him.
3300	3	19	18	19	18	Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against any of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.
3301	3	19	19	19	19	You are to keep My statutes. You shall not crossbreed two different kinds of livestock; you shall not sow your fields with two kinds of seed; and you shall not wear clothing made of two kinds of material.
3302	3	19	20	19	20	If a man lies carnally with a slave girl promised to another man but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. But they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.
3303	3	19	21	19	21	The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting as his guilt offering to the LORD.
3304	3	19	22	19	22	The priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven the sin he has committed.
3305	3	19	23	19	23	When you enter the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you shall regard the fruit as forbidden. For three years it will be forbidden to you and must not be eaten.
3306	3	19	24	19	24	In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD.
3307	3	19	25	19	25	But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit; thus your harvest will be increased. I am the LORD your God.
3308	3	19	26	19	26	You must not eat anything with blood still in it. You must not practice divination or sorcery.
3309	3	19	27	19	27	You must not cut off the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.
3310	3	19	28	19	28	You must not make any cuts in your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD.
3311	3	19	29	19	29	You must not defile your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will be prostituted and filled with depravity.
3312	3	19	30	19	30	You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD.
3313	3	19	31	19	31	You must not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out, or you will be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.
3314	3	19	32	19	32	You are to rise in the presence of the elderly, honor the aged, and fear your God. I am the LORD.
3315	3	19	33	19	33	When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him.
3316	3	19	34	19	34	You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
3317	3	19	35	19	35	You must not use dishonest measures of length, weight, or volume.
3318	3	19	36	19	36	You shall maintain honest scales and weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
3319	3	19	37	19	37	You must keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and follow them. I am the LORD.”
3320	3	20	1	20	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3321	3	20	2	20	2	“Tell the Israelites, ‘Any Israelite or foreigner living in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech must be put to death. The people of the land are to stone him.
3322	3	20	3	20	3	And I will set My face against that man and cut him off from his people, because by giving his offspring to Molech, he has defiled My sanctuary and profaned My holy name.
3323	3	20	4	20	4	And if the people of the land ever hide their eyes and fail to put to death the man who gives one of his children to Molech,
3324	3	20	5	20	5	then I will set My face against that man and his family and cut off from their people both him and all who follow him in prostituting themselves with Molech.
3325	3	20	6	20	6	Whoever turns to mediums or spiritists to prostitute himself with them, I will also set My face against that person and cut him off from his people.
3326	3	20	7	20	7	Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, because I am the LORD your God.
3327	3	20	8	20	8	And you shall keep My statutes and practice them. I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
3328	3	20	9	20	9	If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has cursed his father or mother; his blood shall be upon him.
3329	3	20	10	20	10	If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must surely be put to death.
3330	3	20	11	20	11	If a man lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
3331	3	20	12	20	12	If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both must surely be put to death. They have acted perversely; their blood is upon them.
3332	3	20	13	20	13	If a man lies with a man as with a woman, they have both committed an abomination. They must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
3333	3	20	14	20	14	If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is depraved. Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that there will be no depravity among you.
3334	3	20	15	20	15	If a man lies carnally with an animal, he must be put to death. And you are also to kill the animal.
3335	3	20	16	20	16	If a woman approaches any animal to mate with it, you must kill both the woman and the animal. They must surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
3336	3	20	17	20	17	If a man marries his sister, whether the daughter of his father or of his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They must be cut off in the sight of their people. He has uncovered the nakedness of his sister; he shall bear his iniquity.
3337	3	20	18	20	18	If a man lies with a menstruating woman and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has uncovered the source of her blood. Both of them must be cut off from their people.
3338	3	20	19	20	19	You must not have sexual relations with the sister of your mother or your father, for it is exposing one’s own kin; both shall bear their iniquity.
3339	3	20	20	20	20	If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered the nakedness of his uncle. They will bear their sin; they shall die childless.
3340	3	20	21	20	21	If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is an act of impurity. He has uncovered the nakedness of his brother; they shall be childless.
3341	3	20	22	20	22	You are therefore to keep all My statutes and ordinances, so that the land where I am bringing you to live will not vomit you out.
3342	3	20	23	20	23	You must not follow the statutes of the nations I am driving out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.
3343	3	20	24	20	24	But I have told you that you will inherit their land, since I will give it to you as an inheritance—a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the LORD your God, who has set you apart from the peoples.
3344	3	20	25	20	25	You are therefore to distinguish between clean and unclean animals and birds. Do not become contaminated by any animal or bird, or by anything that crawls on the ground; I have set these apart as unclean for you.
3345	3	20	26	20	26	You are to be holy to Me because I, the LORD, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be My own.
3346	3	20	27	20	27	A man or a woman who is a medium or spiritist must surely be put to death. They shall be stoned; their blood is upon them.’”
3347	3	21	1	21	1	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to Aaron’s sons, the priests, and tell them: ‘A priest is not to defile himself for a dead person among his people,
3348	3	21	2	21	2	except for his immediate family—his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother,
3349	3	21	3	21	3	or his unmarried sister who is near to him, since she has no husband.
3350	3	21	4	21	4	He is not to defile himself for those related to him by marriage, and so profane himself.
3351	3	21	5	21	5	Priests must not make bald spots on their heads, shave off the edges of their beards, or make cuts in their bodies.
3352	3	21	6	21	6	They must be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God. For they present the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the food of their God. So they must be holy.
3353	3	21	7	21	7	A priest must not marry a woman defiled by prostitution or divorced by her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
3354	3	21	8	21	8	You are to regard him as holy, since he presents the food of your God. He shall be holy to you, because I the LORD am holy—I who set you apart.
3355	3	21	9	21	9	If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by prostituting herself, she profanes her father; she must be burned in the fire.
3356	3	21	10	21	10	The priest who is highest among his brothers, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair hang loose or tear his garments.
3357	3	21	11	21	11	He must not go near any dead body; he must not defile himself, even for his father or mother.
3358	3	21	12	21	12	He must not leave or desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the LORD.
3359	3	21	13	21	13	The woman he marries must be a virgin.
3360	3	21	14	21	14	He is not to marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by prostitution. He is to marry a virgin from his own people,
3361	3	21	15	21	15	so that he does not defile his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who sanctifies him.’”
3362	3	21	16	21	16	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3363	3	21	17	21	17	“Say to Aaron, ‘For the generations to come, none of your descendants who has a physical defect may approach to offer the food of his God.
3364	3	21	18	21	18	No man who has any defect may approach—no man who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed;
3365	3	21	19	21	19	no man who has a broken foot or hand,
3366	3	21	20	21	20	or who is a hunchback or dwarf, or who has an eye defect, a festering rash, scabs, or a crushed testicle.
3367	3	21	21	21	21	No descendant of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall approach to present the offerings made by fire to the LORD. Since he has a defect, he is not to come near to offer the food of his God.
3368	3	21	22	21	22	He may eat the most holy food of his God as well as the holy food,
3369	3	21	23	21	23	but because he has a defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, so as not to desecrate My sanctuaries. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’”
3370	3	21	24	21	24	Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
3371	3	22	1	22	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3372	3	22	2	22	2	“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings that the Israelites have consecrated to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name. I am the LORD.
3373	3	22	3	22	3	Say to them: ‘For the generations to come, if any of your descendants in a state of uncleanness approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off from My presence. I am the LORD.
3374	3	22	4	22	4	If a descendant of Aaron has a skin disease or a discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse or by a man who has an emission of semen,
3375	3	22	5	22	5	or whoever touches a crawling creature or a person that makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be—
3376	3	22	6	22	6	the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening. He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
3377	3	22	7	22	7	When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are his food.
3378	3	22	8	22	8	He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD.
3379	3	22	9	22	9	The priests must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
3380	3	22	10	22	10	No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired hand eat it.
3381	3	22	11	22	11	But if a priest buys a slave with his own money, or if a slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food.
3382	3	22	12	22	12	If the priest’s daughter is married to a man other than a priest, she is not to eat of the sacred contributions.
3383	3	22	13	22	13	But if a priest’s daughter with no children becomes widowed or divorced and returns to her father’s house, she may share her father’s food as in her youth. But no outsider may share it.
3384	3	22	14	22	14	If anyone eats a sacred offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the sacred offering to the priest.
3385	3	22	15	22	15	The priests must not profane the sacred offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD
3386	3	22	16	22	16	by allowing the people to eat the sacred offerings and thus to bear the punishment for guilt. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’”
3387	3	22	17	22	17	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3388	3	22	18	22	18	“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or any foreign resident who presents a gift for a burnt offering to the LORD, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,
3389	3	22	19	22	19	must offer an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf.
3390	3	22	20	22	20	You must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be accepted on your behalf.
3391	3	22	21	22	21	When a man presents a peace offering to the LORD from the herd or flock to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without blemish or defect to be acceptable.
3392	3	22	22	22	22	You are not to present to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, or maimed, or anything with a running sore, a festering rash, or a scab; you must not put any of these on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3393	3	22	23	22	23	You may present as a freewill offering an ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb, but it is not acceptable in fulfillment of a vow.
3394	3	22	24	22	24	You are not to present to the LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut; you are not to sacrifice them in your land.
3395	3	22	25	22	25	Neither you nor a foreigner shall present food to your God from any such animal. They will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and flawed.’”
3396	3	22	26	22	26	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3397	3	22	27	22	27	“When an ox, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3398	3	22	28	22	28	But you must not slaughter an ox or a sheep on the same day as its young.
3399	3	22	29	22	29	When you sacrifice a thank offering to the LORD, offer it so that it may be acceptable on your behalf.
3400	3	22	30	22	30	It must be eaten that same day. Do not leave any of it until morning. I am the LORD.
3401	3	22	31	22	31	You are to keep My commandments and practice them. I am the LORD.
3402	3	22	32	22	32	You must not profane My holy name. I must be acknowledged as holy among the Israelites. I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
3403	3	22	33	22	33	who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD.”
3404	3	23	1	23	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3405	3	23	2	23	2	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘These are My appointed feasts, the feasts of the LORD that you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.
3406	3	23	3	23	3	Work may be done for six days, but the seventh day is to be a Sabbath of complete rest, a day of sacred assembly. You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a Sabbath to the LORD.
3407	3	23	4	23	4	These are the LORD’s appointed feasts, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
3408	3	23	5	23	5	The Passover to the LORD begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.
3409	3	23	6	23	6	On the fifteenth day of the same month begins the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD. For seven days you must eat unleavened bread.
3410	3	23	7	23	7	On the first day you shall hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any ordinary work.
3411	3	23	8	23	8	For seven days you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day there shall be a sacred assembly; you must not do any ordinary work.’”
3412	3	23	9	23	9	And the LORD said to Moses,
3413	3	23	10	23	10	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you are to bring to the priest a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest.
3414	3	23	11	23	11	And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that it may be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
3415	3	23	12	23	12	On the day you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD,
3416	3	23	13	23	13	along with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil—an offering made by fire to the LORD, a pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter hin of wine.
3417	3	23	14	23	14	You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain until the very day you have brought this offering to your God. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live.
3418	3	23	15	23	15	From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you are to count off seven full weeks.
3419	3	23	16	23	16	You shall count off fifty days until the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
3420	3	23	17	23	17	Bring two loaves of bread from your dwellings as a wave offering, each made from two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with leaven, as the firstfruits to the LORD.
3421	3	23	18	23	18	Along with the bread you are to present seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
3422	3	23	19	23	19	You shall also prepare one male goat as a sin offering and two male lambs a year old as a peace offering.
3423	3	23	20	23	20	The priest is to wave the lambs as a wave offering before the LORD, together with the bread of the firstfruits. The bread and the two lambs are to be sacred to the LORD for the priest.
3424	3	23	21	23	21	On that same day you are to proclaim a sacred assembly, and you are not to do any regular work. This is to be a permanent statute wherever you live for the generations to come.
3425	3	23	22	23	22	When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap all the way to the edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident. I am the LORD your God.’”
3426	3	23	23	23	23	The LORD also said to Moses,
3427	3	23	24	23	24	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘On the first day of the seventh month you are to have a day of rest, a sacred assembly announced by trumpet blasts.
3428	3	23	25	23	25	You must not do any ordinary work, but you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD.’”
3429	3	23	26	23	26	Again the LORD said to Moses,
3430	3	23	27	23	27	“The tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You shall hold a sacred assembly and humble yourselves, and present an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3431	3	23	28	23	28	On this day you are not to do any work, for it is the Day of Atonement, when atonement is made for you before the LORD your God.
3432	3	23	29	23	29	If anyone does not humble himself on this day, he must be cut off from his people.
3433	3	23	30	23	30	I will destroy from among his people anyone who does any work on this day.
3434	3	23	31	23	31	You are not to do any work at all. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come, wherever you live.
3435	3	23	32	23	32	It will be a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall humble your souls. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you are to keep your Sabbath.”
3436	3	23	33	23	33	And the LORD said to Moses,
3437	3	23	34	23	34	“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month the Feast of Tabernacles to the LORD begins, and it continues for seven days.
3438	3	23	35	23	35	On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly. You are not to do any regular work.
3439	3	23	36	23	36	For seven days you are to present an offering made by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you are to hold a sacred assembly and present an offering made by fire to the LORD. It is a solemn assembly; you are not to do any regular work.
3440	3	23	37	23	37	These are the LORD’s appointed feasts, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for presenting offerings by fire to the LORD—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its designated day.
3441	3	23	38	23	38	These offerings are in addition to the offerings for the LORD’s Sabbaths, and in addition to your gifts, to all your vow offerings, and to all the freewill offerings you give to the LORD.
3442	3	23	39	23	39	On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the produce of the land, you are to celebrate a feast to the LORD for seven days. There shall be complete rest on the first day and also on the eighth day.
3443	3	23	40	23	40	On the first day you are to gather the fruit of majestic trees, the branches of palm trees, and the boughs of leafy trees and of willows of the brook, and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
3444	3	23	41	23	41	You are to celebrate this as a feast to the LORD for seven days each year. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come; you are to celebrate it in the seventh month.
3445	3	23	42	23	42	You are to live in booths for seven days. All the native-born of Israel must live in booths,
3446	3	23	43	23	43	so that your descendants may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’”
3447	3	23	44	23	44	So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed feasts of the LORD.
3448	3	24	1	24	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3449	3	24	2	24	2	“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.
3450	3	24	3	24	3	Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a perpetual statute for the generations to come.
3451	3	24	4	24	4	He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.
3452	3	24	5	24	5	You are also to take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf,
3453	3	24	6	24	6	and set them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
3454	3	24	7	24	7	And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
3455	3	24	8	24	8	Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a perpetual covenant.
3456	3	24	9	24	9	It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD—his portion forever.”
3457	3	24	10	24	10	Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.
3458	3	24	11	24	11	The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
3459	3	24	12	24	12	They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.
3460	3	24	13	24	13	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3461	3	24	14	24	14	“Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him.
3462	3	24	15	24	15	And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.
3463	3	24	16	24	16	Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must to be put to death; the whole assembly surely must stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.
3464	3	24	17	24	17	And if a man takes the life of anyone else, he must surely be put to death.
3465	3	24	18	24	18	Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life.
3466	3	24	19	24	19	If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:
3467	3	24	20	24	20	fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him.
3468	3	24	21	24	21	Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.
3469	3	24	22	24	22	You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’”
3470	3	24	23	24	23	Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3471	3	25	1	25	1	Then the LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai,
3472	3	25	2	25	2	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the LORD.
3473	3	25	3	25	3	For six years you may sow your field and prune your vineyard and gather its crops.
3474	3	25	4	25	4	But in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land—a Sabbath to the LORD. You are not to sow your field or prune your vineyard.
3475	3	25	5	25	5	You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land must have a year of complete rest.
3476	3	25	6	25	6	Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you—for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you,
3477	3	25	7	25	7	and for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its growth may serve as food.
3478	3	25	8	25	8	And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of years—seven times seven years—so that the seven Sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years.
3479	3	25	9	25	9	Then you are to sound the horn far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement. You shall sound it throughout your land.
3480	3	25	10	25	10	So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and to his clan.
3481	3	25	11	25	11	The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you; you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest the untended vines.
3482	3	25	12	25	12	For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field.
3483	3	25	13	25	13	In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his own property.
3484	3	25	14	25	14	If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, you must not take advantage of one another.
3485	3	25	15	25	15	You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee; he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining.
3486	3	25	16	25	16	You shall increase the price in proportion to a greater number of years, or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years; for he is selling you a given number of harvests.
3487	3	25	17	25	17	Do not take advantage of one another, but fear your God; for I am the LORD your God.
3488	3	25	18	25	18	You are to keep My statutes and carefully observe My judgments, so that you may dwell securely in the land.
3489	3	25	19	25	19	Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat your fill and dwell in safety in the land.
3490	3	25	20	25	20	Now you may wonder, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?’
3491	3	25	21	25	21	But I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year, so that the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years.
3492	3	25	22	25	22	While you are sowing in the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest, until the ninth year’s harvest comes in.
3493	3	25	23	25	23	The land must not be sold permanently, because it is Mine, and you are but foreigners and residents with Me.
3494	3	25	24	25	24	Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
3495	3	25	25	25	25	If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold.
3496	3	25	26	25	26	Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land,
3497	3	25	27	25	27	he shall calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his property.
3498	3	25	28	25	28	But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released, so that he may return to his property.
3499	3	25	29	25	29	If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale; during that year it may be redeemed.
3500	3	25	30	25	30	If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be released in the Jubilee.
3501	3	25	31	25	31	But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
3502	3	25	32	25	32	As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess.
3503	3	25	33	25	33	So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—a house sold in a city they possess—and must be released in the Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites.
3504	3	25	34	25	34	But the open fields around their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession.
3505	3	25	35	25	35	Now if your countryman becomes destitute and cannot support himself among you, then you are to help him as you would a foreigner or stranger, so that he can continue to live among you.
3506	3	25	36	25	36	Do not take any interest or profit from him, but fear your God, that your countryman may live among you.
3507	3	25	37	25	37	You must not lend him your silver with interest or sell him your food for profit.
3508	3	25	38	25	38	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
3509	3	25	39	25	39	If a countryman among you becomes destitute and sells himself to you, then you must not force him into slave labor.
3510	3	25	40	25	40	Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
3511	3	25	41	25	41	Then he and his children are to be released, and he may return to his clan and to the property of his fathers.
3512	3	25	42	25	42	Because the Israelites are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as slaves.
3513	3	25	43	25	43	You are not to rule over them harshly, but you shall fear your God.
3514	3	25	44	25	44	Your menservants and maidservants shall come from the nations around you, from whom you may purchase them.
3515	3	25	45	25	45	You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or their clans living among you who are born in your land. These may become your property.
3516	3	25	46	25	46	You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But as for your brothers, the Israelites, no man may rule harshly over his brother.
3517	3	25	47	25	47	If a foreigner residing among you prospers, but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan,
3518	3	25	48	25	48	he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may redeem him:
3519	3	25	49	25	49	either his uncle or cousin or any close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
3520	3	25	50	25	50	He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on the daily wages of a hired hand.
3521	3	25	51	25	51	If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price.
3522	3	25	52	25	52	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years.
3523	3	25	53	25	53	Like a man hired from year to year, he will stay with him, but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight.
3524	3	25	54	25	54	Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee.
3525	3	25	55	25	55	For the Israelites are My servants. They are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.”
3526	3	26	1	26	1	“You must not make idols for yourselves or set up a carved image or sacred pillar; you must not place a sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it. For I am the LORD your God.
3527	3	26	2	26	2	You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD.
3528	3	26	3	26	3	If you follow My statutes and carefully keep My commandments,
3529	3	26	4	26	4	I will give you rains in their season, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear their fruit.
3530	3	26	5	26	5	Your threshing will continue until the grape harvest, and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time; you will have your fill of food to eat and will dwell securely in your land.
3531	3	26	6	26	6	And I will give peace to the land, and you will lie down with nothing to fear. I will rid the land of dangerous animals, and no sword will pass through your land.
3532	3	26	7	26	7	You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.
3533	3	26	8	26	8	Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
3534	3	26	9	26	9	I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you.
3535	3	26	10	26	10	You will still be eating the old supply of grain when you need to clear it out to make room for the new.
3536	3	26	11	26	11	And I will make My dwelling place among you, and My soul will not despise you.
3537	3	26	12	26	12	I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people.
3538	3	26	13	26	13	I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk in uprightness.
3539	3	26	14	26	14	If, however, you fail to obey Me and to carry out all these commandments,
3540	3	26	15	26	15	and if you reject My statutes, despise My ordinances, and neglect to carry out all My commandments, and so break My covenant,
3541	3	26	16	26	16	then this is what I will do to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting disease, and fever that will destroy your sight and drain your life. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it.
3542	3	26	17	26	17	And I will set My face against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you.
3543	3	26	18	26	18	And if after all this you will not obey Me, I will proceed to punish you sevenfold for your sins.
3544	3	26	19	26	19	I will break down your stubborn pride and make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,
3545	3	26	20	26	20	and your strength will be spent in vain. For your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not bear their fruit.
3546	3	26	21	26	21	If you walk in hostility toward Me and refuse to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times, according to your sins.
3547	3	26	22	26	22	I will send wild animals against you to rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your numbers, until your roads lie desolate.
3548	3	26	23	26	23	And if in spite of these things you do not accept My discipline, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me,
3549	3	26	24	26	24	then I will act with hostility toward you, and I will strike you sevenfold for your sins.
3550	3	26	25	26	25	And I will bring a sword against you to execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
3551	3	26	26	26	26	When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out your bread by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied.
3552	3	26	27	26	27	But if in spite of all this you do not obey Me, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me,
3553	3	26	28	26	28	then I will act with furious rage against you, and I Myself will punish you sevenfold for your sins.
3554	3	26	29	26	29	You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters.
3555	3	26	30	26	30	I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and heap your lifeless bodies on the lifeless remains of your idols; and My soul will despise you.
3556	3	26	31	26	31	I will reduce your cities to rubble and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will refuse to smell the pleasing aroma of your sacrifices.
3557	3	26	32	26	32	And I will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who dwell in it will be appalled.
3558	3	26	33	26	33	But I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out a sword after you as your land becomes desolate and your cities are laid waste.
3559	3	26	34	26	34	Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.
3560	3	26	35	26	35	As long as it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not receive during the Sabbaths when you lived in it.
3561	3	26	36	26	36	As for those of you who survive, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, so that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. And they will flee as one flees the sword, and fall when no one pursues them.
3562	3	26	37	26	37	They will stumble over one another as before the sword, though no one is behind them. So you will not be able to stand against your enemies.
3563	3	26	38	26	38	You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.
3564	3	26	39	26	39	Those of you who survive in the lands of your enemies will waste away in their iniquity and will decay in the sins of their fathers.
3565	3	26	40	26	40	But if they will confess their iniquity and that of their fathers in the unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me, by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me—
3566	3	26	41	26	41	and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies—and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled and they will make amends for their iniquity,
3567	3	26	42	26	42	then I will remember My covenant with Jacob and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
3568	3	26	43	26	43	For the land will be abandoned by them, and it will enjoy its Sabbaths by lying desolate without them. And they will pay the penalty for their iniquity, because they rejected My ordinances and abhorred My statutes.
3569	3	26	44	26	44	Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject or despise them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.
3570	3	26	45	26	45	But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their fathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.”
3571	3	26	46	26	46	These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws that the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses on Mount Sinai.
3572	3	27	1	27	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3573	3	27	2	27	2	“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When someone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the value of persons,
3574	3	27	3	27	3	if the valuation concerns a male from twenty to sixty years of age, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3575	3	27	4	27	4	Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.
3576	3	27	5	27	5	And if the person is from five to twenty years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
3577	3	27	6	27	6	Now if the person is from one month to five years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female three shekels of silver.
3578	3	27	7	27	7	And if the person is sixty years of age or older, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female.
3579	3	27	8	27	8	But if the one making the vow is too poor to pay the valuation, he is to present the person before the priest, who shall set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford.
3580	3	27	9	27	9	If he vows an animal that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any such animal given to the LORD shall be holy.
3581	3	27	10	27	10	He must not replace it or exchange it, either good for bad or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy.
3582	3	27	11	27	11	But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest.
3583	3	27	12	27	12	The priest shall set its value, whether high or low; as the priest values it, the price will be set.
3584	3	27	13	27	13	If, however, the owner decides to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value.
3585	3	27	14	27	14	Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it either as good or bad. The price will stand just as the priest values it.
3586	3	27	15	27	15	But if he who consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it will belong to him.
3587	3	27	16	27	16	If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed.
3588	3	27	17	27	17	If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation.
3589	3	27	18	27	18	But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced.
3590	3	27	19	27	19	And if the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it shall belong to him.
3591	3	27	20	27	20	If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed.
3592	3	27	21	27	21	When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it becomes the property of the priests.
3593	3	27	22	27	22	Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased, which is not a part of his own property,
3594	3	27	23	27	23	then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a sacred offering to the LORD.
3595	3	27	24	27	24	In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought—the original owner of the land.
3596	3	27	25	27	25	Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
3597	3	27	26	27	26	But no one may consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, because a firstborn belongs to the LORD. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD’s.
3598	3	27	27	27	27	But if it is among the unclean animals, then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a fifth of its value. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
3599	3	27	28	27	28	Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD from all he owns—whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land—can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.
3600	3	27	29	27	29	No person set apart for destruction may be ransomed; he must surely be put to death.
3601	3	27	30	27	30	Thus any tithe from the land, whether from the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
3602	3	27	31	27	31	If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value.
3603	3	27	32	27	32	Every tenth animal from the herd or flock that passes under the shepherd’s rod will be holy to the LORD.
3604	3	27	33	27	33	He must not inspect whether it is good or bad, and he shall not make any substitution. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute shall become holy; they cannot be redeemed.’”
3605	3	27	34	27	34	These are the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
3606	4	1	1	1	1	On the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Wilderness of Sinai. He said:
3607	4	1	2	1	2	“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one.
3608	4	1	3	1	3	You and Aaron are to register those who are twenty years of age or older by their divisions—everyone who can serve in Israel’s army.
3609	4	1	4	1	4	And one man from each tribe, the head of each family, must be there with you.
3610	4	1	5	1	5	These are the names of the men who are to assist you: From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;
3611	4	1	6	1	6	from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;
3612	4	1	7	1	7	from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab;
3613	4	1	8	1	8	from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar;
3614	4	1	9	1	9	from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon;
3615	4	1	10	1	10	from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur;
3616	4	1	11	1	11	from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni;
3617	4	1	12	1	12	from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai;
3618	4	1	13	1	13	from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran;
3619	4	1	14	1	14	from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel;
3620	4	1	15	1	15	and from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.”
3621	4	1	16	1	16	These men were appointed from the congregation; they were the leaders of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the clans of Israel.
3622	4	1	17	1	17	So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
3623	4	1	18	1	18	and on the first day of the second month they assembled the whole congregation and recorded their ancestry by clans and families, counting one by one the names of those twenty years of age or older,
3624	4	1	19	1	19	just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So Moses numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai:
3625	4	1	20	1	20	From the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older, everyone who could serve in the army,
3626	4	1	21	1	21	those registered to the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500.
3627	4	1	22	1	22	From the sons of Simeon, according to the records of their clans and families, counting one by one the names of every male twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3628	4	1	23	1	23	those registered to the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300.
3629	4	1	24	1	24	From the sons of Gad, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3630	4	1	25	1	25	those registered to the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650.
3631	4	1	26	1	26	From the sons of Judah, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3632	4	1	27	1	27	those registered to the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600.
3633	4	1	28	1	28	From the sons of Issachar, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3634	4	1	29	1	29	those registered to the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400.
3635	4	1	30	1	30	From the sons of Zebulun, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3636	4	1	31	1	31	those registered to the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400.
3637	4	1	32	1	32	From the sons of Joseph: From the sons of Ephraim, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3638	4	1	33	1	33	those registered to the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500.
3639	4	1	34	1	34	And from the sons of Manasseh, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3640	4	1	35	1	35	those registered to the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200.
3641	4	1	36	1	36	From the sons of Benjamin, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3642	4	1	37	1	37	those registered to the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400.
3643	4	1	38	1	38	From the sons of Dan, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3644	4	1	39	1	39	those registered to the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700.
3645	4	1	40	1	40	From the sons of Asher, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3646	4	1	41	1	41	those registered to the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500.
3647	4	1	42	1	42	From the sons of Naphtali, according to the records of their clans and families, counting the names of those twenty years of age or older who could serve in the army,
3648	4	1	43	1	43	those registered to the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400.
3649	4	1	44	1	44	These were the men numbered by Moses and Aaron, with the assistance of the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family.
3650	4	1	45	1	45	So all the Israelites twenty years of age or older who could serve in Israel’s army were registered according to their families.
3651	4	1	46	1	46	And the total of those registered numbered 603,550.
3652	4	1	47	1	47	The Levites, however, were not listed along with them by the tribe of their fathers.
3653	4	1	48	1	48	For the LORD had said to Moses:
3654	4	1	49	1	49	“Do not register the tribe of Levi in the census with the other Israelites.
3655	4	1	50	1	50	Instead, you are to appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles, care for it, and camp around it.
3656	4	1	51	1	51	Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to be pitched, the Levites are to set it up. Any outsider who goes near it must be put to death.
3657	4	1	52	1	52	The Israelites are to camp by their divisions, each man in his own camp and under his own standard.
3658	4	1	53	1	53	But the Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony and watch over it, so that no wrath will fall on the congregation of Israel. So the Levites are responsible for the tabernacle of the Testimony.”
3659	4	1	54	1	54	Thus the Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3660	4	2	1	2	1	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron:
3661	4	2	2	2	2	“The Israelites are to camp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance from it, each man under his standard, with the banners of his family.
3662	4	2	3	2	3	On the east side, toward the sunrise, the divisions of Judah are to camp under their standard: The leader of the descendants of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab,
3663	4	2	4	2	4	and his division numbers 74,600.
3664	4	2	5	2	5	The tribe of Issachar will camp next to it. The leader of the Issacharites is Nethanel son of Zuar,
3665	4	2	6	2	6	and his division numbers 54,400.
3666	4	2	7	2	7	Next will be the tribe of Zebulun. The leader of the Zebulunites is Eliab son of Helon,
3667	4	2	8	2	8	and his division numbers 57,400.
3668	4	2	9	2	9	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Judah is 186,400; they shall set out first.
3669	4	2	10	2	10	On the south side, the divisions of Reuben are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Reubenites is Elizur son of Shedeur,
3670	4	2	11	2	11	and his division numbers 46,500.
3671	4	2	12	2	12	The tribe of Simeon will camp next to it. The leader of the Simeonites is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
3672	4	2	13	2	13	and his division numbers 59,300.
3673	4	2	14	2	14	Next will be the tribe of Gad. The leader of the Gadites is Eliasaph son of Deuel,
3674	4	2	15	2	15	and his division numbers 45,650.
3675	4	2	16	2	16	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Reuben is 151,450; they shall set out second.
3676	4	2	17	2	17	In the middle of the camps, the Tent of Meeting is to travel with the camp of the Levites. They are to set out in the order they encamped, each in his own place under his standard.
3677	4	2	18	2	18	On the west side, the divisions of Ephraim are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Ephraimites is Elishama son of Ammihud,
3678	4	2	19	2	19	and his division numbers 40,500.
3679	4	2	20	2	20	The tribe of Manasseh will be next to it. The leader of the Manassites is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
3680	4	2	21	2	21	and his division numbers 32,200.
3681	4	2	22	2	22	Next will be the tribe of Benjamin. The leader of the Benjamites is Abidan son of Gideoni,
3682	4	2	23	2	23	and his division numbers 35,400.
3683	4	2	24	2	24	The total number of men in the divisions of the camp of Ephraim is 108,100; they shall set out third.
3684	4	2	25	2	25	On the north side, the divisions of Dan are to camp under their standard: The leader of the Danites is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai,
3685	4	2	26	2	26	and his division numbers 62,700.
3686	4	2	27	2	27	The tribe of Asher will camp next to it. The leader of the Asherites is Pagiel son of Ocran,
3687	4	2	28	2	28	and his division numbers 41,500.
3688	4	2	29	2	29	Next will be the tribe of Naphtali. The leader of the Naphtalites is Ahira son of Enan,
3689	4	2	30	2	30	and his division numbers 53,400.
3690	4	2	31	2	31	The total number of men in the camp of Dan is 157,600; they shall set out last, under their standards.”
3691	4	2	32	2	32	These are the Israelites, registered according to their families. The total of those numbered in the camps, by their divisions, was 603,550.
3692	4	2	33	2	33	But the Levites were not counted among the other Israelites, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3693	4	2	34	2	34	So the Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; they camped under their standards in this way and set out in the same way, each man with his clan and his family.
3694	4	3	1	3	1	This is the account of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
3695	4	3	2	3	2	These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3696	4	3	3	3	3	These were Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
3697	4	3	4	3	4	Nadab and Abihu, however, died in the presence of the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. And since they had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
3698	4	3	5	3	5	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3699	4	3	6	3	6	“Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
3700	4	3	7	3	7	They are to perform duties for him and for the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, attending to the service of the tabernacle.
3701	4	3	8	3	8	They shall take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and fulfill obligations for the Israelites by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
3702	4	3	9	3	9	Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they have been given exclusively to him from among the Israelites.
3703	4	3	10	3	10	So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; but any outsider who approaches the tabernacle must be put to death.”
3704	4	3	11	3	11	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3705	4	3	12	3	12	“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites belong to Me,
3706	4	3	13	3	13	for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine; I am the LORD.”
3707	4	3	14	3	14	Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying,
3708	4	3	15	3	15	“Register the Levites by their families and clans. You are to count every male a month old or more.”
3709	4	3	16	3	16	So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he had been commanded.
3710	4	3	17	3	17	These were the sons of Levi by name: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
3711	4	3	18	3	18	These were the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
3712	4	3	19	3	19	The sons of Kohath by their clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
3713	4	3	20	3	20	And the sons of Merari by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites, according to their families.
3714	4	3	21	3	21	From Gershon came the Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan; these were the Gershonite clans.
3715	4	3	22	3	22	The number of all the males a month old or more was 7,500.
3716	4	3	23	3	23	The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle,
3717	4	3	24	3	24	and the leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
3718	4	3	25	3	25	The duties of the Gershonites at the Tent of Meeting were the tabernacle and tent, its covering, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
3719	4	3	26	3	26	the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, and the cords—all the service for these items.
3720	4	3	27	3	27	From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites.
3721	4	3	28	3	28	The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. They were responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
3722	4	3	29	3	29	The clans of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
3723	4	3	30	3	30	and the leader of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
3724	4	3	31	3	31	Their duties were the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used with them, and the curtain—all the service for these items.
3725	4	3	32	3	32	The chief of the leaders of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he oversaw those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
3726	4	3	33	3	33	From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
3727	4	3	34	3	34	The number of all the males one month old or more was 6,200.
3728	4	3	35	3	35	The leader of the families of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
3729	4	3	36	3	36	The duties assigned to the sons of Merari were the tabernacle’s frames, crossbars, posts, bases, and all its equipment—all the service for these items,
3730	4	3	37	3	37	as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes.
3731	4	3	38	3	38	Moses, Aaron, and Aaron’s sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, before the Tent of Meeting. They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites; but any outsider who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
3732	4	3	39	3	39	The total number of Levites that Moses and Aaron registered by their clans at the LORD’s command, including all the males a month old or more, was 22,000.
3733	4	3	40	3	40	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the Israelites a month old or more, and list their names.
3734	4	3	41	3	41	You are to take the Levites for Me—I am the LORD—in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.”
3735	4	3	42	3	42	So Moses numbered all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him.
3736	4	3	43	3	43	The total number of the firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
3737	4	3	44	3	44	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3738	4	3	45	3	45	“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites belong to Me; I am the LORD.
3739	4	3	46	3	46	To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites,
3740	4	3	47	3	47	you are to collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel of twenty gerahs.
3741	4	3	48	3	48	Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the excess among the Israelites.”
3742	4	3	49	3	49	So Moses collected the redemption money from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites.
3743	4	3	50	3	50	He collected the money from the firstborn of the Israelites: 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3744	4	3	51	3	51	And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the word of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
3745	4	4	1	4	1	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
3746	4	4	2	4	2	“Take a census of the Kohathites among the Levites by their clans and families,
3747	4	4	3	4	3	men from thirty to fifty years old—everyone who is qualified to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3748	4	4	4	4	4	This service of the Kohathites at the Tent of Meeting regards the most holy things.
3749	4	4	5	4	5	Whenever the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons are to go in, take down the veil of the curtain, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.
3750	4	4	6	4	6	They are to place over this a covering of fine leather, spread a solid blue cloth over it, and insert its poles.
3751	4	4	7	4	7	Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and place the plates and cups on it, along with the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering. The regular bread offering is to remain on it.
3752	4	4	8	4	8	And they shall spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover them with fine leather, and insert the poles.
3753	4	4	9	4	9	They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand used for light, together with its lamps, wick trimmers, and trays, as well as the jars of oil with which to supply it.
3754	4	4	10	4	10	Then they shall wrap it and all its utensils inside a covering of fine leather and put it on the carrying frame.
3755	4	4	11	4	11	Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth, cover it with fine leather, and insert the poles.
3756	4	4	12	4	12	They are to take all the utensils for serving in the sanctuary, place them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine leather, and put them on the carrying frame.
3757	4	4	13	4	13	Then they shall remove the ashes from the bronze altar, spread a purple cloth over it,
3758	4	4	14	4	14	and place on it all the vessels used to serve there: the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and sprinkling bowls—all the equipment of the altar. They are to spread over it a covering of fine leather and insert the poles.
3759	4	4	15	4	15	When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all their equipment, as soon as the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites shall come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy objects, or they will die. These are the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of Meeting.
3760	4	4	16	4	16	Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall oversee the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including the holy objects and their utensils.”
3761	4	4	17	4	17	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
3762	4	4	18	4	18	“Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be cut off from among the Levites.
3763	4	4	19	4	19	In order that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go in and assign each man his task and what he is to carry.
3764	4	4	20	4	20	But the Kohathites are not to go in and look at the holy objects, even for a moment, or they will die.”
3765	4	4	21	4	21	And the LORD said to Moses,
3766	4	4	22	4	22	“Take a census of the Gershonites as well, by their families and clans,
3767	4	4	23	4	23	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone who comes to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3768	4	4	24	4	24	This is the service of the Gershonite clans regarding work and transport:
3769	4	4	25	4	25	They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with the covering of fine leather over it, the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
3770	4	4	26	4	26	the curtains of the courtyard, and the curtains for the entrance at the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, along with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. The Gershonites will do all that needs to be done with these items.
3771	4	4	27	4	27	All the service of the Gershonites—all their transport duties and other work—is to be done at the direction of Aaron and his sons; you are to assign to them all that they are responsible to carry.
3772	4	4	28	4	28	This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
3773	4	4	29	4	29	As for the sons of Merari, you are to register them by their clans and families,
3774	4	4	30	4	30	from thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone who comes to serve in the work of the Tent of Meeting.
3775	4	4	31	4	31	This is the duty for all their service at the Tent of Meeting: to carry the frames of the tabernacle with its crossbars, posts, and bases,
3776	4	4	32	4	32	the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their equipment and everything related to their use. You shall assign by name the items that they are responsible to carry.
3777	4	4	33	4	33	This is the service of the Merarite clans according to all their work at the Tent of Meeting, under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.”
3778	4	4	34	4	34	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the Kohathites by their clans and families,
3779	4	4	35	4	35	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3780	4	4	36	4	36	And those numbered by their clans totaled 2,750.
3781	4	4	37	4	37	These were counted from the Kohathite clans, everyone who could serve at the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron numbered them according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
3782	4	4	38	4	38	Then the Gershonites were numbered by their clans and families,
3783	4	4	39	4	39	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3784	4	4	40	4	40	And those numbered by their clans and families totaled 2,630.
3785	4	4	41	4	41	These were counted from the Gershonite clans who served at the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted at the LORD’s command.
3786	4	4	42	4	42	And the Merarites were counted by their clans and their families,
3787	4	4	43	4	43	everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3788	4	4	44	4	44	The men registered by their clans numbered 3,200.
3789	4	4	45	4	45	These were counted from the Merarite clans, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the LORD’s command through Moses.
3790	4	4	46	4	46	So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted by their clans and families all the Levites
3791	4	4	47	4	47	from thirty to fifty years old who came to do the work of serving and carrying the Tent of Meeting.
3792	4	4	48	4	48	And the number of men was 8,580.
3793	4	4	49	4	49	At the LORD’s command they were registered through Moses and each one was assigned his work and burden, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3794	4	5	1	5	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3795	4	5	2	5	2	“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone with a skin disease, anyone who has a bodily discharge, and anyone who is defiled by a dead body.
3796	4	5	3	5	3	You must send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.”
3797	4	5	4	5	4	So the Israelites did this, sending such people outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
3798	4	5	5	5	5	And the LORD said to Moses,
3799	4	5	6	5	6	“Tell the Israelites that when a man or woman acts unfaithfully against the LORD by committing any sin against another, that person is guilty
3800	4	5	7	5	7	and must confess the sin he has committed. He must make full restitution, add a fifth to its value, and give all this to the one he has wronged.
3801	4	5	8	5	8	But if the man has no relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest along with the ram of atonement, by which the atonement is made for him.
3802	4	5	9	5	9	Every sacred contribution the Israelites bring to the priest shall belong to him.
3803	4	5	10	5	10	Each man’s sacred gifts are his own, but whatever he gives to the priest will belong to the priest.”
3804	4	5	11	5	11	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3805	4	5	12	5	12	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that if any man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
3806	4	5	13	5	13	by sleeping with another man, and it is concealed from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she was not caught in the act),
3807	4	5	14	5	14	and if a feeling of jealousy comes over her husband and he suspects his wife who has defiled herself—or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him and he suspects her even though she has not defiled herself—
3808	4	5	15	5	15	then he is to bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring for her an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He is not to pour oil over it or put frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, an offering of memorial as a reminder of iniquity.
3809	4	5	16	5	16	The priest is to bring the wife forward and have her stand before the LORD.
3810	4	5	17	5	17	Then he is to take some holy water in a clay jar and put some of the dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
3811	4	5	18	5	18	After the priest has the woman stand before the LORD, he is to let down her hair and place in her hands the grain offering of memorial, which is the grain offering for jealousy. The priest is to hold the bitter water that brings a curse.
3812	4	5	19	5	19	And he is to put the woman under oath and say to her, ‘If no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become defiled while under your husband’s authority, may you be immune to this bitter water that brings a curse.
3813	4	5	20	5	20	But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority and have defiled yourself and lain carnally with a man other than your husband’—
3814	4	5	21	5	21	and the priest shall have the woman swear under the oath of the curse—‘then may the LORD make you an attested curse among your people by making your thigh shrivel and your belly swell.
3815	4	5	22	5	22	May this water that brings a curse enter your stomach and cause your belly to swell and your thigh to shrivel.’ Then the woman is to say, ‘Amen, Amen.’
3816	4	5	23	5	23	And the priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.
3817	4	5	24	5	24	He is to have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and it will enter her and cause her bitter suffering.
3818	4	5	25	5	25	The priest shall take from her hand the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD, and bring it to the altar.
3819	4	5	26	5	26	The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar; after that he is to have the woman drink the water.
3820	4	5	27	5	27	When he has made her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, then the water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitter suffering; her belly will swell, her thigh will shrivel, and she will become accursed among her people.
3821	4	5	28	5	28	But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will be unaffected and able to conceive children.
3822	4	5	29	5	29	This is the law of jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband’s authority,
3823	4	5	30	5	30	or when a feeling of jealousy comes over a husband and he suspects his wife. He is to have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest is to apply to her this entire law.
3824	4	5	31	5	31	The husband will be free from guilt, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.”
3825	4	6	1	6	1	Again the LORD said to Moses,
3826	4	6	2	6	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: If a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD,
3827	4	6	3	6	3	he is to abstain from wine and strong drink. He must not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink, and he must not drink any grape juice or eat fresh grapes or raisins.
3828	4	6	4	6	4	All the days of his separation, he is not to eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
3829	4	6	5	6	5	For the entire period of his vow of separation, no razor shall pass over his head. He must be holy until the time of his separation to the LORD is complete; he must let the hair of his head grow long.
3830	4	6	6	6	6	Throughout the days of his separation to the LORD, he must not go near a dead body.
3831	4	6	7	6	7	Even if his father or mother or brother or sister should die, he is not to defile himself, because the crown of consecration to his God is upon his head.
3832	4	6	8	6	8	Throughout the time of his separation, he is holy to the LORD.
3833	4	6	9	6	9	If someone suddenly dies in his presence and defiles his consecrated head of hair, he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing—the seventh day.
3834	4	6	10	6	10	On the eighth day he must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3835	4	6	11	6	11	And the priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him, because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. On that day he must consecrate his head again.
3836	4	6	12	6	12	He must rededicate his time of separation to the LORD and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. But the preceding days shall not be counted, because his separation was defiled.
3837	4	6	13	6	13	Now this is the law of the Nazirite when his time of separation is complete: He must be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
3838	4	6	14	6	14	and he is to present an offering to the LORD of an unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, an unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, and an unblemished ram as a peace offering—
3839	4	6	15	6	15	together with their grain offerings and drink offerings—and a basket of unleavened cakes made from fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers coated with oil.
3840	4	6	16	6	16	The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
3841	4	6	17	6	17	He shall also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread. And the priest is to offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering.
3842	4	6	18	6	18	Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head, take the hair, and put it on the fire under the peace offering.
3843	4	6	19	6	19	And the priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration.
3844	4	6	20	6	20	The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. This is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the wave offering and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
3845	4	6	21	6	21	This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD for his separation, in addition to whatever else he can afford; he must fulfill whatever vow he makes, according to the law of his separation.”
3846	4	6	22	6	22	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3847	4	6	23	6	23	“Tell Aaron and his sons: This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:
3848	4	6	24	6	24	‘May the LORD bless you and keep you;
3849	4	6	25	6	25	may the LORD cause His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
3850	4	6	26	6	26	may the LORD lift up His countenance toward you and give you peace.’
3851	4	6	27	6	27	So they shall put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
3852	4	7	1	7	1	On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils.
3853	4	7	2	7	2	And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, presented an offering. These men were the tribal leaders who had supervised the registration.
3854	4	7	3	7	3	They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two leaders—and presented them before the tabernacle.
3855	4	7	4	7	4	And the LORD said to Moses,
3856	4	7	5	7	5	“Accept these gifts from them, that they may be used in the work of the Tent of Meeting. And give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”
3857	4	7	6	7	6	So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
3858	4	7	7	7	7	He gave the Gershonites two carts and four oxen, as their service required,
3859	4	7	8	7	8	and he gave the Merarites four carts and eight oxen, as their service required, all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
3860	4	7	9	7	9	But he did not give any to the Kohathites, since they were to carry on their shoulders the holy objects for which they were responsible.
3861	4	7	10	7	10	When the altar was anointed, the leaders approached with their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.
3862	4	7	11	7	11	And the LORD said to Moses, “Each day one leader is to present his offering for the dedication of the altar.”
3863	4	7	12	7	12	On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah drew near with his offering.
3864	4	7	13	7	13	His offering was one silver platter weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, both according to the sanctuary shekel and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering;
3865	4	7	14	7	14	one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense;
3866	4	7	15	7	15	one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb a year old for a burnt offering;
3867	4	7	16	7	16	one male goat for a sin offering;
3868	4	7	17	7	17	and a peace offering of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old. This was the offering of Nahshon son of Amminadab.
3869	4	7	18	7	18	On the second day Nethanel son of Zuar, the leader of Issachar, drew near.

3881	4	7	30	7	30	On the fourth day Elizur son of Shedeur, the leader of the Reubenites, drew near.

3915	4	7	64	7	64	one male goat for a sin offering;
3916	4	7	65	7	65	and a peace offering of two oxen, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old. This was the offering of Abidan son of Gideoni.

3936	4	7	85	7	85	Each silver platter weighed a hundred and thirty shekels, and each bowl seventy shekels. The total weight of the silver articles was two thousand four hundred shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
3937	4	7	86	7	86	The twelve gold dishes filled with incense weighed ten shekels each, according to the sanctuary shekel. The total weight of the gold dishes was a hundred and twenty shekels.
3938	4	7	87	7	87	All the livestock for the burnt offering totaled twelve bulls, twelve rams, and twelve male lambs a year old—together with their grain offerings—and twelve male goats for the sin offering.
3939	4	7	88	7	88	All the livestock sacrificed for the peace offering totaled twenty-four bulls, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty male lambs a year old. This was the dedication offering for the altar after it was anointed.
3940	4	7	89	7	89	When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony. Thus the LORD spoke to him.
3941	4	8	1	8	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3942	4	8	2	8	2	“Speak to Aaron and tell him: ‘When you set up the seven lamps, they are to light the area in front of the lampstand.’”
3943	4	8	3	8	3	And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps facing toward the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3944	4	8	4	8	4	This is how the lampstand was constructed: it was made of hammered gold from its base to its blossoms, fashioned according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses.
3945	4	8	5	8	5	Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
3946	4	8	6	8	6	“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.
3947	4	8	7	8	7	This is what you must do to cleanse them: Sprinkle them with the water of purification. Have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
3948	4	8	8	8	8	Then have them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
3949	4	8	9	8	9	Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole congregation of Israel.
3950	4	8	10	8	10	You are to present the Levites before the LORD and have the Israelites lay their hands upon them.
3951	4	8	11	8	11	Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may perform the service of the LORD.
3952	4	8	12	8	12	And the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and offer to the LORD one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.
3953	4	8	13	8	13	You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and then present them before the LORD as a wave offering.
3954	4	8	14	8	14	In this way you shall separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites, and the Levites will belong to Me.
3955	4	8	15	8	15	After you have cleansed them and presented them as a wave offering, they may come to serve at the Tent of Meeting.
3956	4	8	16	8	16	For the Levites have been wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.
3957	4	8	17	8	17	For every firstborn male in Israel is Mine, both man and beast. I set them apart for Myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt.
3958	4	8	18	8	18	But I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.
3959	4	8	19	8	19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”
3960	4	8	20	8	20	So Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel did with the Levites everything that the LORD had commanded Moses they should do.
3961	4	8	21	8	21	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them.
3962	4	8	22	8	22	After that, the Levites came to perform their service at the Tent of Meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. Thus they did with the Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3963	4	8	23	8	23	And the LORD said to Moses,
3964	4	8	24	8	24	“This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years of age or older shall enter to perform the service in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
3965	4	8	25	8	25	But at the age of fifty, they must retire from performing the work and no longer serve.
3966	4	8	26	8	26	After that, they may assist their brothers in fulfilling their duties at the Tent of Meeting, but they themselves are not to do the work. This is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites.”
3967	4	9	1	9	1	In the first month of the second year after Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
3968	4	9	2	9	2	“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time.
3969	4	9	3	9	3	You are to observe it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with its statutes and ordinances.”
3970	4	9	4	9	4	So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover,
3971	4	9	5	9	5	and they did so in the Wilderness of Sinai, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
3972	4	9	6	9	6	But there were some men who were unclean due to a dead body, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day
3973	4	9	7	9	7	and said to Moses, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?”
3974	4	9	8	9	8	“Wait here until I hear what the LORD commands concerning you,” Moses replied.
3975	4	9	9	9	9	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3976	4	9	10	9	10	“Tell the Israelites: ‘When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a dead body, or is away on a journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD.
3977	4	9	11	9	11	Such people are to observe it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;
3978	4	9	12	9	12	they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes.
3979	4	9	13	9	13	But if a man who is ceremonially clean and is not on a journey still fails to observe the Passover, he must be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’s offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.
3980	4	9	14	9	14	If a foreigner dwelling among you wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.’”
3981	4	9	15	9	15	On the day that the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it and appeared like fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning.
3982	4	9	16	9	16	It remained that way continually; the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day, and at night it would appear like fire.
3983	4	9	17	9	17	Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the Tent, the Israelites would set out, and wherever the cloud settled, there the Israelites would camp.
3984	4	9	18	9	18	At the LORD’s command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD’s command they camped. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they remained encamped.
3985	4	9	19	9	19	Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites kept the LORD’s charge and did not set out.
3986	4	9	20	9	20	Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for only a few days, and they would camp at the LORD’s command and set out at the LORD’s command.
3987	4	9	21	9	21	Sometimes the cloud remained only from evening until morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they would set out. Whether it was by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up, they would set out.
3988	4	9	22	9	22	Whether the cloud lingered for two days, a month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle; but when it was lifted, they would set out.
3989	4	9	23	9	23	They camped at the LORD’s command, and they set out at the LORD’s command; they carried out the LORD’s charge according to His command through Moses.
3990	4	10	1	10	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
3991	4	10	2	10	2	“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation and for having the camps set out.
3992	4	10	3	10	3	When both are sounded, the whole congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
3993	4	10	4	10	4	But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, are to gather before you.
3994	4	10	5	10	5	When you sound short blasts, the camps that lie on the east side are to set out.
3995	4	10	6	10	6	When you sound the short blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set out. The blasts are to signal them to set out.
3996	4	10	7	10	7	To convene the assembly, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones.
3997	4	10	8	10	8	The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. This shall be a perpetual statute for you and the generations to come.
3998	4	10	9	10	9	When you enter into battle in your land against an adversary who attacks you, sound short blasts on the trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God and saved from your enemies.
3999	4	10	10	10	10	And on your joyous occasions, your appointed feasts, and the beginning of each month, you are to blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”
4000	4	10	11	10	11	On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony,
4001	4	10	12	10	12	and the Israelites set out from the Wilderness of Sinai, traveling from place to place until the cloud settled in the Wilderness of Paran.
4002	4	10	13	10	13	They set out this first time according to the LORD’s command through Moses.
4003	4	10	14	10	14	First, the divisions of the camp of Judah set out under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.
4004	4	10	15	10	15	Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
4005	4	10	16	10	16	and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
4006	4	10	17	10	17	Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting it.
4007	4	10	18	10	18	Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben set out under their standard, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
4008	4	10	19	10	19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
4009	4	10	20	10	20	and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
4010	4	10	21	10	21	Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival.
4011	4	10	22	10	22	Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim set out under their standard, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.
4012	4	10	23	10	23	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
4013	4	10	24	10	24	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
4014	4	10	25	10	25	Finally, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard, serving as the rear guard for all units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command.
4015	4	10	26	10	26	Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
4016	4	10	27	10	27	and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
4017	4	10	28	10	28	This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
4018	4	10	29	10	29	Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of Moses’ father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said: ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”
4019	4	10	30	10	30	“I will not go,” Hobab replied. “Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
4020	4	10	31	10	31	“Please do not leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes.
4021	4	10	32	10	32	If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.”
4022	4	10	33	10	33	So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of the LORD, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them.
4023	4	10	34	10	34	And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
4024	4	10	35	10	35	Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, “Rise up, O LORD! May Your enemies be scattered; may those who hate You flee before You.”
4025	4	10	36	10	36	And when it came to rest, he would say: “Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.”
4026	4	11	1	11	1	Soon the people began to complain about their hardship in the hearing of the LORD, and when He heard them, His anger was kindled, and fire from the LORD blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp.
4027	4	11	2	11	2	And the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down.
4028	4	11	3	11	3	So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the LORD had burned among them.
4029	4	11	4	11	4	Meanwhile, the rabble among them had a strong craving for other food, and again the Israelites wept and said, “Who will feed us meat?
4030	4	11	5	11	5	We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
4031	4	11	6	11	6	But now our appetite is gone; there is nothing to see but this manna!”
4032	4	11	7	11	7	Now the manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of gum resin.
4033	4	11	8	11	8	The people walked around and gathered it, ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes. It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil.
4034	4	11	9	11	9	When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
4035	4	11	10	11	10	Then Moses heard the people of family after family weeping at the entrances to their tents, and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly, and Moses was also displeased.
4036	4	11	11	11	11	So Moses asked the LORD, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? Why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people?
4037	4	11	12	11	12	Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers?
4038	4	11	13	11	13	Where can I get meat for all these people? For they keep crying out to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’
4039	4	11	14	11	14	I cannot carry all these people by myself; it is too burdensome for me.
4040	4	11	15	11	15	If this is how You are going to treat me, please kill me right now—if I have found favor in Your eyes—and let me not see my own wretchedness.”
4041	4	11	16	11	16	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel known to you as leaders and officers of the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting and have them stand there with you.
4042	4	11	17	11	17	And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit that is upon you and put that Spirit upon them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself.
4043	4	11	18	11	18	And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, because you have cried out in the hearing of the LORD, saying: ‘Who will feed us meat? For we were better off in Egypt!’ Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat.
4044	4	11	19	11	19	You will eat it not for one or two days, nor for five or ten or twenty days,
4045	4	11	20	11	20	but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and makes you nauseous—because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have cried out before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”
4046	4	11	21	11	21	But Moses replied, “Here I am among 600,000 men on foot, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.’
4047	4	11	22	11	22	If all our flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”
4048	4	11	23	11	23	The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come to pass.”
4049	4	11	24	11	24	So Moses went out and relayed to the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.
4050	4	11	25	11	25	Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but they never did so again.
4051	4	11	26	11	26	Two men, however, had remained in the camp—one named Eldad and the other Medad—and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp.
4052	4	11	27	11	27	A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
4053	4	11	28	11	28	Joshua son of Nun, the attendant to Moses since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”
4054	4	11	29	11	29	But Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? I wish that all the LORD’s people were prophets and that the LORD would place His Spirit on them!”
4055	4	11	30	11	30	Then Moses returned to the camp, along with the elders of Israel.
4056	4	11	31	11	31	Now a wind sent by the LORD came up, drove in quail from the sea, and brought them near the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground, for a day’s journey in every direction around the camp.
4057	4	11	32	11	32	All that day and night, and all the next day, the people stayed up gathering the quail. No one gathered less than ten homers, and they spread them out all around the camp.
4058	4	11	33	11	33	But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the LORD’s anger burned against the people, and the LORD struck them with a severe plague.
4059	4	11	34	11	34	So they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
4060	4	11	35	11	35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth, where they remained for some time.
4061	4	12	1	12	1	Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife.
4062	4	12	2	12	2	“Does the LORD speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard this.
4063	4	12	3	12	3	Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth.
4064	4	12	4	12	4	And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three went out,
4065	4	12	5	12	5	and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the Tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward,
4066	4	12	6	12	6	He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision; I will speak to him in a dream.
4067	4	12	7	12	7	But this is not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house.
4068	4	12	8	12	8	I speak with him face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you unafraid to speak against My servant Moses?”
4069	4	12	9	12	9	So the anger of the LORD burned against them, and He departed.
4070	4	12	10	12	10	As the cloud lifted from above the Tent, suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous,
4071	4	12	11	12	11	and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed.
4072	4	12	12	12	12	Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
4073	4	12	13	12	13	So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!”
4074	4	12	14	12	14	But the LORD answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.”
4075	4	12	15	12	15	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again.
4076	4	12	16	12	16	After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
4077	4	13	1	13	1	And the LORD said to Moses,
4078	4	13	2	13	2	“Send out for yourself men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each of their fathers’ tribes send one man who is a leader among them.”
4079	4	13	3	13	3	So at the consent of the LORD, Moses sent them out from the Wilderness of Paran. All the men were leaders of the Israelites,
4080	4	13	4	13	4	and these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
4081	4	13	5	13	5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
4082	4	13	6	13	6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
4083	4	13	7	13	7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
4084	4	13	8	13	8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
4085	4	13	9	13	9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
4086	4	13	10	13	10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
4087	4	13	11	13	11	from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
4088	4	13	12	13	12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
4089	4	13	13	13	13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
4090	4	13	14	13	14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
4091	4	13	15	13	15	and from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi.
4092	4	13	16	13	16	These were the names of the men Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.
4093	4	13	17	13	17	When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill country.
4094	4	13	18	13	18	See what the land is like and whether its people are strong or weak, few or many.
4095	4	13	19	13	19	Is the land where they live good or bad? Are the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications?
4096	4	13	20	13	20	Is the soil fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous, and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
4097	4	13	21	13	21	So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo-hamath.
4098	4	13	22	13	22	They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled. It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
4099	4	13	23	13	23	When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men. They also took some pomegranates and figs.
4100	4	13	24	13	24	Because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there, that place was called the Valley of Eshcol.
4101	4	13	25	13	25	After forty days the men returned from spying out the land,
4102	4	13	26	13	26	and they went back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for the whole congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
4103	4	13	27	13	27	And they gave this account to Moses: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit!
4104	4	13	28	13	28	Nevertheless, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified. We even saw the descendants of Anak there.
4105	4	13	29	13	29	The Amalekites live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and along the Jordan.”
4106	4	13	30	13	30	Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We must go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly conquer it!”
4107	4	13	31	13	31	But the men who had gone up with him replied, “We cannot go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are!”
4108	4	13	32	13	32	So they gave the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out: “The land we explored devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw there are great in stature.
4109	4	13	33	13	33	We even saw the Nephilim there—the descendants of Anak that come from the Nephilim! We seemed like grasshoppers in our own sight, and we must have seemed the same to them!”
4110	4	14	1	14	1	Then the whole congregation lifted up their voices and cried out, and that night the people wept.
4111	4	14	2	14	2	All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!
4112	4	14	3	14	3	Why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
4113	4	14	4	14	4	So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”
4114	4	14	5	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel.
4115	4	14	6	14	6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
4116	4	14	7	14	7	and said to the whole congregation of Israel, “The land we passed through and explored is an exceedingly good land.
4117	4	14	8	14	8	If the LORD delights in us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us.
4118	4	14	9	14	9	Only do not rebel against the LORD, and do not be afraid of the people of the land, for they will be like bread for us. Their protection has been removed, and the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them!”
4119	4	14	10	14	10	But the whole congregation threatened to stone Joshua and Caleb. Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting.
4120	4	14	11	14	11	And the LORD said to Moses, “How long will this people treat Me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them?
4121	4	14	12	14	12	I will strike them with a plague and destroy them—and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.”
4122	4	14	13	14	13	But Moses said to the LORD, “The Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought this people from among them.
4123	4	14	14	14	14	And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have already heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst of this people, that You, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
4124	4	14	15	14	15	If You kill this people as one man, the nations who have heard of Your fame will say,
4125	4	14	16	14	16	‘Because the LORD was unable to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’
4126	4	14	17	14	17	So now I pray, may the power of the Lord be magnified, just as You have declared:
4127	4	14	18	14	18	‘The LORD is slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion, forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion. But He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He visits the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation.’
4128	4	14	19	14	19	Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion, just as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.”
4129	4	14	20	14	20	“I have pardoned them as you requested,” the LORD replied.
4130	4	14	21	14	21	“Yet as surely as I live and as surely as the whole earth is filled with the glory of the LORD,
4131	4	14	22	14	22	not one of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet have tested Me and disobeyed Me these ten times—
4132	4	14	23	14	23	not one will ever see the land that I swore to give their fathers. None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it.
4133	4	14	24	14	24	But because My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he has entered, and his descendants will inherit it.
4134	4	14	25	14	25	Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.”
4135	4	14	26	14	26	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4136	4	14	27	14	27	“How long will this wicked congregation grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints that the Israelites are making against Me.
4137	4	14	28	14	28	So tell them: As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you exactly as I heard you say.
4138	4	14	29	14	29	Your bodies will fall in this wilderness—all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty years of age or older—because you have grumbled against Me.
4139	4	14	30	14	30	Surely none of you will enter the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4140	4	14	31	14	31	But I will bring your children, whom you said would become plunder, into the land you have rejected—and they will enjoy it.
4141	4	14	32	14	32	As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
4142	4	14	33	14	33	Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lie scattered in the wilderness.
4143	4	14	34	14	34	In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear your guilt forty years—a year for each day—and you will experience My alienation.
4144	4	14	35	14	35	I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation, which has conspired against Me. They will meet their end in the wilderness, and there they will die.”
4145	4	14	36	14	36	So the men Moses had sent to spy out the land, who had returned and made the whole congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report about the land—
4146	4	14	37	14	37	those men who had brought out the bad report about the land—were struck down by a plague before the LORD.
4147	4	14	38	14	38	Of those men who had gone to spy out the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive.
4148	4	14	39	14	39	And when Moses relayed these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly.
4149	4	14	40	14	40	Early the next morning they got up and went up toward the ridge of the hill country. “We have indeed sinned,” they said, “but we will go to the place the LORD has promised.”
4150	4	14	41	14	41	But Moses said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD? This will not succeed!
4151	4	14	42	14	42	Do not go up, lest you be struck down by your enemies, because the LORD is not among you.
4152	4	14	43	14	43	For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, He will not be with you.”
4153	4	14	44	14	44	But they dared to go up to the ridge of the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the covenant of the LORD moved from the camp.
4154	4	14	45	14	45	Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them all the way to Hormah.
4155	4	15	1	15	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4156	4	15	2	15	2	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land that I am giving you to settle
4157	4	15	3	15	3	and you present an offering made by fire to the LORD from the herd or flock to produce a pleasing aroma to the LORD—either a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a freewill or festival offering—
4158	4	15	4	15	4	then the one presenting his offering to the LORD shall also present a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter hin of olive oil.
4159	4	15	5	15	5	With the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb, prepare a quarter hin of wine as a drink offering.
4160	4	15	6	15	6	With a ram you are to prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of olive oil,
4161	4	15	7	15	7	and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4162	4	15	8	15	8	When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the LORD,
4163	4	15	9	15	9	present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil.
4164	4	15	10	15	10	Also present half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4165	4	15	11	15	11	This is to be done for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat.
4166	4	15	12	15	12	This is how you must prepare each one, no matter how many.
4167	4	15	13	15	13	Everyone who is native-born shall prepare these things in this way when he presents an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4168	4	15	14	15	14	And for the generations to come, if a foreigner residing with you or someone else among you wants to prepare an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he is to do exactly as you do.
4169	4	15	15	15	15	The assembly is to have the same statute both for you and for the foreign resident; it is a permanent statute for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same before the LORD.
4170	4	15	16	15	16	The same law and the same ordinance will apply both to you and the foreigner residing with you.”
4171	4	15	17	15	17	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4172	4	15	18	15	18	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land to which I am bringing you
4173	4	15	19	15	19	and you eat the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering to the LORD.
4174	4	15	20	15	20	From the first of your dough, you are to lift up a cake as a contribution; offer it just like an offering from the threshing floor.
4175	4	15	21	15	21	Throughout your generations, you are to give the LORD an offering from the first of your dough.
4176	4	15	22	15	22	Now if you stray unintentionally and do not obey all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses—
4177	4	15	23	15	23	all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come—
4178	4	15	24	15	24	and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, then the whole congregation is to prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and one male goat as a sin offering.
4179	4	15	25	15	25	The priest is to make atonement for the whole congregation of Israel, so that they may be forgiven; for the sin was unintentional and they have brought to the LORD an offering made by fire and a sin offering, presented before the LORD for their unintentional sin.
4180	4	15	26	15	26	Then the whole congregation of Israel and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, since it happened to all the people unintentionally.
4181	4	15	27	15	27	Also, if one person sins unintentionally, he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering.
4182	4	15	28	15	28	And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person who erred by sinning unintentionally; and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven.
4183	4	15	29	15	29	You shall have the same law for the one who acts in error, whether he is a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you.
4184	4	15	30	15	30	But the person who sins defiantly, whether a native or foreigner, blasphemes the LORD. That person shall be cut off from his people.
4185	4	15	31	15	31	He shall certainly be cut off, because he has despised the word of the LORD and broken His commandment; his guilt remains on him.”
4186	4	15	32	15	32	While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
4187	4	15	33	15	33	Those who found the man gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole congregation,
4188	4	15	34	15	34	and because it had not been declared what should be done to him, they placed him in custody.
4189	4	15	35	15	35	And the LORD said to Moses, “The man must surely be put to death. The whole congregation is to stone him outside the camp.”
4190	4	15	36	15	36	So the whole congregation took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
4191	4	15	37	15	37	Later, the LORD said to Moses,
4192	4	15	38	15	38	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them that throughout the generations to come they are to make for themselves tassels for the corners of their garments, with a blue cord on each tassel.
4193	4	15	39	15	39	These will serve as tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by following your own heart and your own eyes.
4194	4	15	40	15	40	Then you will remember and obey all My commandments, and you will be holy to your God.
4195	4	15	41	15	41	I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.”
4196	4	16	1	16	1	Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath son of Levi, along with some Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—conducted
4197	4	16	2	16	2	a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation and representatives in the assembly.
4198	4	16	3	16	3	They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves! For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and the LORD is in their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”
4199	4	16	4	16	4	When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
4200	4	16	5	16	5	Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself.
4201	4	16	6	16	6	You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as follows: Take censers,
4202	4	16	7	16	7	and tomorrow you are to place fire and incense in them in the presence of the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!”
4203	4	16	8	16	8	Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you sons of Levi!
4204	4	16	9	16	9	Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to Himself to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
4205	4	16	10	16	10	He has brought you near, you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood as well.
4206	4	16	11	16	11	Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?”
4207	4	16	12	16	12	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!
4208	4	16	13	16	13	Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us?
4209	4	16	14	16	14	Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!”
4210	4	16	15	16	15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.”
4211	4	16	16	16	16	So Moses told Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.
4212	4	16	17	16	17	Each man is to take his censer, place incense in it, and present it before the LORD—250 censers. You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.”
4213	4	16	18	16	18	So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
4214	4	16	19	16	19	When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole congregation.
4215	4	16	20	16	20	And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4216	4	16	21	16	21	“Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.”
4217	4	16	22	16	22	But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the whole congregation?”
4218	4	16	23	16	23	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4219	4	16	24	16	24	“Tell the congregation to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
4220	4	16	25	16	25	So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
4221	4	16	26	16	26	And he warned the congregation, “Move away now from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”
4222	4	16	27	16	27	So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and stood at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children and infants.
4223	4	16	28	16	28	Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things, for it was not my own doing:
4224	4	16	29	16	29	If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me.
4225	4	16	30	16	30	But if the LORD brings about something unprecedented, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.”
4226	4	16	31	16	31	As soon as Moses had finished saying all this, the ground beneath them split open,
4227	4	16	32	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households—all Korah’s men and all their possessions.
4228	4	16	33	16	33	They went down alive into Sheol with all they owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly.
4229	4	16	34	16	34	At their cries, all the people of Israel who were around them fled, saying, “The earth may swallow us too!”
4230	4	16	35	16	35	And fire came forth from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
4231	4	17	1	16	36	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4232	4	17	2	16	37	“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the censers from the flames, because they are holy, and to scatter the coals far away.
4233	4	17	3	16	38	As for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for these were presented before the LORD, and so have become holy. They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.”
4234	4	17	4	16	39	So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
4235	4	17	5	16	40	just as the LORD commanded him through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his followers.
4236	4	17	6	16	41	The next day the whole congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the LORD’s people!”
4237	4	17	7	16	42	But when the congregation gathered against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
4238	4	17	8	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
4239	4	17	9	16	44	and the LORD said to Moses,
4240	4	17	10	16	45	“Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” And Moses and Aaron fell facedown.
4241	4	17	11	16	46	Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has begun.”
4242	4	17	12	16	47	So Aaron took the censer as Moses had ordered and ran into the midst of the assembly. And seeing that the plague had begun among the people, he offered the incense and made atonement for the people.
4243	4	17	13	16	48	He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was halted.
4244	4	17	14	16	49	But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah.
4245	4	17	15	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, since the plague had been halted.
4246	4	17	16	17	1	And the LORD said to Moses,
4247	4	17	17	17	2	“Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff,
4248	4	17	18	17	3	and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.
4249	4	17	19	17	4	Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you.
4250	4	17	20	17	5	The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.”
4251	4	17	21	17	6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them.
4252	4	17	22	17	7	Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.
4253	4	17	23	17	8	The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds.
4254	4	17	24	17	9	Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff.
4255	4	17	25	17	10	The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.”
4256	4	17	26	17	11	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him.
4257	4	17	27	17	12	Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost!
4258	4	17	28	17	13	Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to perish?”
4259	4	18	1	18	1	So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s house must bear the iniquity involving the sanctuary. And you and your sons alone must bear the iniquity involving your priesthood.
4260	4	18	2	18	2	But bring with you also your brothers from the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you and assist you and your sons before the Tent of the Testimony.
4261	4	18	3	18	3	And they shall attend to your duties and to all the duties of the Tent; but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die.
4262	4	18	4	18	4	They are to join you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at the Tent; but no outsider may come near you.
4263	4	18	5	18	5	And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and of the altar, so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again.
4264	4	18	6	18	6	Behold, I Myself have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to perform the service for the Tent of Meeting.
4265	4	18	7	18	7	But only you and your sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and what is inside the veil, and you are to perform that service. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but any outsider who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.”
4266	4	18	8	18	8	Then the LORD said to Aaron, “Behold, I have put you in charge of My offerings. As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a permanent statute.
4267	4	18	9	18	9	A portion of the most holy offerings reserved from the fire will be yours. From all the offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings, whether grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.
4268	4	18	10	18	10	You are to eat it as a most holy offering. Every male may eat it; it shall be holy to you.
4269	4	18	11	18	11	And this is yours as well: the offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given this to you and your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat it.
4270	4	18	12	18	12	I give you all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain that the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits.
4271	4	18	13	18	13	The firstfruits of everything in their land that they bring to the LORD will belong to you. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them.
4272	4	18	14	18	14	Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to you.
4273	4	18	15	18	15	The firstborn of every womb, whether man or beast, that is offered to the LORD belongs to you. But you must surely redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
4274	4	18	16	18	16	You are to pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs.
4275	4	18	17	18	17	But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4276	4	18	18	18	18	And their meat belongs to you, just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you.
4277	4	18	19	18	19	All the holy offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD for you and your offspring.”
4278	4	18	20	18	20	Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
4279	4	18	21	18	21	Behold, I have given to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the service of the Tent of Meeting.
4280	4	18	22	18	22	No longer may the Israelites come near to the Tent of Meeting, or they will incur guilt and die.
4281	4	18	23	18	23	The Levites are to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting, and they must bear their iniquity. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.
4282	4	18	24	18	24	For I have given to the Levites as their inheritance the tithe that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution. That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.”
4283	4	18	25	18	25	And the LORD instructed Moses,
4284	4	18	26	18	26	“Speak to the Levites and tell them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD—a tithe of the tithe.
4285	4	18	27	18	27	Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
4286	4	18	28	18	28	So you are to present an offering to the LORD from every tithe you receive from the Israelites, and from it give the LORD’s offering to Aaron the priest.
4287	4	18	29	18	29	You must present the offering due the LORD from all the best of every gift, the holiest part of it.’
4288	4	18	30	18	30	Therefore say to the Levites, ‘When you have presented the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the produce of the threshing floor or the winepress.
4289	4	18	31	18	31	And you and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere; it is the compensation for your work at the Tent of Meeting.
4290	4	18	32	18	32	Once you have presented the best part of it, you will not incur guilt because of it. But you must not defile the sacred offerings of the Israelites, or else you will die.’”
4291	4	19	1	19	1	Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4292	4	19	2	19	2	“This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded: Instruct the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red heifer that has no defect and has never been placed under a yoke.
4293	4	19	3	19	3	Give it to Eleazar the priest, and he will have it brought outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
4294	4	19	4	19	4	Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.
4295	4	19	5	19	5	Then the heifer must be burned in his sight. Its hide, its flesh, and its blood are to be burned, along with its dung.
4296	4	19	6	19	6	The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
4297	4	19	7	19	7	Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean until evening.
4298	4	19	8	19	8	The one who burned the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he too will be ceremonially unclean until evening.
4299	4	19	9	19	9	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to gather up the ashes of the heifer and store them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They must be kept by the congregation of Israel for preparing the water of purification; this is for purification from sin.
4300	4	19	10	19	10	The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner residing among them.
4301	4	19	11	19	11	Whoever touches any dead body will be unclean for seven days.
4302	4	19	12	19	12	He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.
4303	4	19	13	19	13	Anyone who touches a human corpse and fails to purify himself defiles the tabernacle of the LORD. That person must be cut off from Israel. He remains unclean, because the water of purification has not been sprinkled on him, and his uncleanness is still on him.
4304	4	19	14	19	14	This is the law when a person dies in a tent: Everyone who enters the tent and everyone already in the tent will be unclean for seven days,
4305	4	19	15	19	15	and any open container without a lid fastened on it is unclean.
4306	4	19	16	19	16	Anyone in the open field who touches someone who has been killed by the sword or has died of natural causes, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
4307	4	19	17	19	17	For the purification of the unclean person, take some of the ashes of the burnt purification offering, put them in a jar, and pour fresh running water over them.
4308	4	19	18	19	18	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He is also to sprinkle the one who touched a bone, grave, or person who has died or been slain.
4309	4	19	19	19	19	The man who is ceremonially clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day. After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day, the one being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and that evening he will be clean.
4310	4	19	20	19	20	But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself, he will be cut off from the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
4311	4	19	21	19	21	This is a permanent statute for the people: The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening.
4312	4	19	22	19	22	Anything the unclean person touches will become unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.”
4313	4	20	1	20	1	In the first month, the whole congregation of Israel entered the Wilderness of Zin and stayed in Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
4314	4	20	2	20	2	Now there was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron.
4315	4	20	3	20	3	The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished with our brothers before the LORD!
4316	4	20	4	20	4	Why have you brought the LORD’s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
4317	4	20	5	20	5	Why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates—and there is no water to drink!”
4318	4	20	6	20	6	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
4319	4	20	7	20	7	And the LORD said to Moses,
4320	4	20	8	20	8	“Take the staff and assemble the congregation. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will pour out its water. You will bring out water from the rock and provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.”
4321	4	20	9	20	9	So Moses took the staff from the LORD’s presence, just as he had been commanded.
4322	4	20	10	20	10	Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen now, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”
4323	4	20	11	20	11	Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink.
4324	4	20	12	20	12	But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.”
4325	4	20	13	20	13	These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD, and He showed His holiness among them.
4326	4	20	14	20	14	From Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to tell the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardship that has befallen us,
4327	4	20	15	20	15	how our fathers went down to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,
4328	4	20	16	20	16	and when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.
4329	4	20	17	20	17	Please let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway; we will not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”
4330	4	20	18	20	18	But Edom answered, “You may not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.”
4331	4	20	19	20	19	“We will stay on the main road,” the Israelites replied, “and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay for it. There will be no problem; only let us pass through on foot.”
4332	4	20	20	20	20	But Edom insisted, “You may not pass through.” And they came out to confront the Israelites with a large army and a strong hand.
4333	4	20	21	20	21	So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their territory, and Israel turned away from them.
4334	4	20	22	20	22	After they had set out from Kadesh, the whole congregation of Israel came to Mount Hor.
4335	4	20	23	20	23	And at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
4336	4	20	24	20	24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land that I have given the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.
4337	4	20	25	20	25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.
4338	4	20	26	20	26	Remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”
4339	4	20	27	20	27	So Moses did as the LORD had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole congregation.
4340	4	20	28	20	28	After Moses had removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
4341	4	20	29	20	29	When the whole congregation saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.
4342	4	21	1	21	1	When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners.
4343	4	21	2	21	2	So Israel made a vow to the LORD: “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we will devote their cities to destruction.”
4344	4	21	3	21	3	And the LORD heard Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. Israel devoted them and their cities to destruction; so they named the place Hormah.
4345	4	21	4	21	4	Then they set out from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient on the journey
4346	4	21	5	21	5	and spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!”
4347	4	21	6	21	6	So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died.
4348	4	21	7	21	7	Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD to take the snakes away from us.” So Moses interceded for the people.
4349	4	21	8	21	8	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.”
4350	4	21	9	21	9	So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he would live.
4351	4	21	10	21	10	Then the Israelites set out and camped at Oboth.
4352	4	21	11	21	11	They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness opposite Moab to the east.
4353	4	21	12	21	12	From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered.
4354	4	21	13	21	13	From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the Amorite territory. Now the Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.
4355	4	21	14	21	14	Therefore it is stated in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: “Waheb in Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon,
4356	4	21	15	21	15	even the slopes of the wadis that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.”
4357	4	21	16	21	16	From there they went on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people so that I may give them water.”
4358	4	21	17	21	17	Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well, all of you sing to it!
4359	4	21	18	21	18	The princes dug the well; the nobles of the people hollowed it out with their scepters and with their staffs.” From the wilderness the Israelites went on to Mattanah,
4360	4	21	19	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
4361	4	21	20	21	20	and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
4362	4	21	21	21	21	Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
4363	4	21	22	21	22	“Let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
4364	4	21	23	21	23	But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he fought against Israel.
4365	4	21	24	21	24	And Israel put him to the sword and took possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified.
4366	4	21	25	21	25	Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its villages.
4367	4	21	26	21	26	Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the Arnon.
4368	4	21	27	21	27	That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be restored.
4369	4	21	28	21	28	For a fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the rulers of Arnon’s heights.
4370	4	21	29	21	29	Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He gave up his sons as refugees, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
4371	4	21	30	21	30	But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. We demolished them as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.”
4372	4	21	31	21	31	So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
4373	4	21	32	21	32	After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
4374	4	21	33	21	33	Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan marched out against them with his whole army to do battle at Edrei.
4375	4	21	34	21	34	But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hands, with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
4376	4	21	35	21	35	So they struck down Og, along with his sons and his whole army, until no remnant was left. And they took possession of his land.
4377	4	22	1	22	1	Then the Israelites traveled on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan, across from Jericho.
4378	4	22	2	22	2	Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
4379	4	22	3	22	3	and Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous. Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites.
4380	4	22	4	22	4	So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time,
4381	4	22	5	22	5	he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people. “Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,” said Balak. “They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
4382	4	22	6	22	6	So please come now and put a curse on these people, because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land; for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.”
4383	4	22	7	22	7	The elders of Moab and Midian departed with the fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak.
4384	4	22	8	22	8	“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and I will give you the answer that the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
4385	4	22	9	22	9	Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
4386	4	22	10	22	10	And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
4387	4	22	11	22	11	‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.’”
4388	4	22	12	22	12	But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.”
4389	4	22	13	22	13	So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s princes, “Go back to your homeland, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”
4390	4	22	14	22	14	And the princes of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
4391	4	22	15	22	15	Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first messengers.
4392	4	22	16	22	16	They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
4393	4	22	17	22	17	for I will honor you richly and do whatever you say. So please come and put a curse on these people for me!’”
4394	4	22	18	22	18	But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything small or great to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.
4395	4	22	19	22	19	So now, please stay here overnight as the others did, that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.”
4396	4	22	20	22	20	That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.”
4397	4	22	21	22	21	So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
4398	4	22	22	22	22	Then God’s anger was kindled because Balaam was going along, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
4399	4	22	23	22	23	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the path and went into a field. So Balaam beat her to return her to the path.
4400	4	22	24	22	24	Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between two vineyards, with walls on either side.
4401	4	22	25	22	25	And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD and pressed herself against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat her once again.
4402	4	22	26	22	26	And the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or left.
4403	4	22	27	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he became furious and beat her with his staff.
4404	4	22	28	22	28	Then the LORD opened the donkey’s mouth, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?”
4405	4	22	29	22	29	Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!”
4406	4	22	30	22	30	But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” “No,” he replied.
4407	4	22	31	22	31	Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown.
4408	4	22	32	22	32	The angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you, because your way is perverse before me.
4409	4	22	33	22	33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, then by now I would surely have killed you and let her live.”
4410	4	22	34	22	34	“I have sinned,” Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “for I did not realize that you were standing in the road to confront me. And now, if this is displeasing in your sight, I will go back home.”
4411	4	22	35	22	35	But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
4412	4	22	36	22	36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
4413	4	22	37	22	37	And he said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to richly reward you?”
4414	4	22	38	22	38	“See, I have come to you,” Balaam replied, “but can I say just anything? I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.”
4415	4	22	39	22	39	So Balaam accompanied Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
4416	4	22	40	22	40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he gave portions to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
4417	4	22	41	22	41	The next morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people.
4418	4	23	1	23	1	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me seven altars here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”
4419	4	23	2	23	2	So Balak did as Balaam had instructed, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4420	4	23	3	23	3	“Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone,” Balaam said to Balak. “Perhaps the LORD will meet with me. And whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you.” So Balaam went off to a barren height,
4421	4	23	4	23	4	and God met with him. “I have set up seven altars,” Balaam said, “and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.”
4422	4	23	5	23	5	Then the LORD put a message in Balaam’s mouth, saying, “Return to Balak and give him this message.”
4423	4	23	6	23	6	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there beside his burnt offering, with all the princes of Moab.
4424	4	23	7	23	7	And Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the mountains of the east. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘put a curse on Jacob for me; come and denounce Israel!’
4425	4	23	8	23	8	How can I curse what God has not cursed? How can I denounce what the LORD has not denounced?
4426	4	23	9	23	9	For I see them from atop the rocky cliffs, and I watch them from the hills. Behold, a people dwelling apart, not reckoning themselves among the nations.
4427	4	23	10	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous; let my end be like theirs!”
4428	4	23	11	23	11	Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, and behold, you have only blessed them!”
4429	4	23	12	23	12	But Balaam replied, “Should I not speak exactly what the LORD puts in my mouth?”
4430	4	23	13	23	13	Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place where you can see them. You will only see the outskirts of their camp—not all of them. And from there, curse them for me.”
4431	4	23	14	23	14	So Balak took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4432	4	23	15	23	15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your burnt offering while I meet the LORD over there.”
4433	4	23	16	23	16	And the LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth, saying, “Return to Balak and speak what I tell you.”
4434	4	23	17	23	17	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the princes of Moab. “What did the LORD say?” Balak asked.
4435	4	23	18	23	18	Then Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Arise, O Balak, and listen; give ear to me, O son of Zippor.
4436	4	23	19	23	19	God is not a man, that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and not act? Does He promise and not fulfill?
4437	4	23	20	23	20	I have indeed received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot change it.
4438	4	23	21	23	21	He considers no disaster for Jacob; He sees no trouble for Israel. The LORD their God is with them, and the shout of the King is among them.
4439	4	23	22	23	22	God brought them out of Egypt with strength like a wild ox.
4440	4	23	23	23	23	For there is no spell against Jacob and no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘What great things God has done!’
4441	4	23	24	23	24	Behold, the people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion, not resting until they devour their prey and drink the blood of the slain.”
4442	4	23	25	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!”
4443	4	23	26	23	26	But Balaam replied, “Did I not tell you that whatever the LORD says, I must do?”
4444	4	23	27	23	27	“Please come,” said Balak, “I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you curse them for me from there.”
4445	4	23	28	23	28	And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.
4446	4	23	29	23	29	Then Balaam said, “Build for me seven altars here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams.”
4447	4	23	30	23	30	So Balak did as Balaam had instructed, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
4448	4	24	1	24	1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as on previous occasions, but he turned his face toward the wilderness.
4449	4	24	2	24	2	When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him,
4450	4	24	3	24	3	and he lifted up an oracle, saying: “This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,
4451	4	24	4	24	4	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open:
4452	4	24	5	24	5	How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!
4453	4	24	6	24	6	They spread out like palm groves, like gardens beside a stream, like aloes the LORD has planted, like cedars beside the waters.
4454	4	24	7	24	7	Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will have abundant water. His king will be greater than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted.
4455	4	24	8	24	8	God brought him out of Egypt with strength like a wild ox, to devour hostile nations and crush their bones, to pierce them with arrows.
4456	4	24	9	24	9	He crouches, he lies down like a lion; like a lioness, who dares to rouse him? Blessed are those who bless you and cursed are those who curse you.”
4457	4	24	10	24	10	Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together and said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times.
4458	4	24	11	24	11	Therefore, flee at once to your home! I said I would richly reward you, but instead the LORD has denied your reward.”
4459	4	24	12	24	12	Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not already tell the messengers you sent me
4460	4	24	13	24	13	that even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD? I will speak whatever the LORD says.
4461	4	24	14	24	14	Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.”
4462	4	24	15	24	15	Then Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying, “This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,
4463	4	24	16	24	16	the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open:
4464	4	24	17	24	17	I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come forth from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the skulls of Moab and strike down all the sons of Sheth.
4465	4	24	18	24	18	Edom will become a possession, as will Seir, his enemy; but Israel will perform with valor.
4466	4	24	19	24	19	A ruler will come from Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.”
4467	4	24	20	24	20	Then Balaam saw Amalek and lifted up an oracle, saying: “Amalek was first among the nations, but his end is destruction.”
4468	4	24	21	24	21	Next he saw the Kenites and lifted up an oracle, saying: “Your dwelling place is secure, and your nest is set in a cliff.
4469	4	24	22	24	22	Yet Kain will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.”
4470	4	24	23	24	23	Once more Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying: “Ah, who can live unless God has ordained it?
4471	4	24	24	24	24	Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will perish forever.”
4472	4	24	25	24	25	Then Balaam arose and returned to his homeland, and Balak also went on his way.
4473	4	25	1	25	1	While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab,
4474	4	25	2	25	2	who also invited them to the sacrifices for their gods. And the people ate and bowed down to these gods.
4475	4	25	3	25	3	So Israel joined in worshiping Baal of Peor, and the LORD’s anger burned against them.
4476	4	25	4	25	4	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”
4477	4	25	5	25	5	So Moses told the judges of Israel, “Each of you must kill all of his men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.”
4478	4	25	6	25	6	Just then, an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
4479	4	25	7	25	7	On seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
4480	4	25	8	25	8	followed the Israelite into his tent, and drove the spear through both of them—through the Israelite and on through the belly of the woman. So the plague against the Israelites was halted,
4481	4	25	9	25	9	but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
4482	4	25	10	25	10	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4483	4	25	11	25	11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the Israelites; for he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal.
4484	4	25	12	25	12	Declare, therefore, that I grant him My covenant of peace.
4485	4	25	13	25	13	It will be a covenant of permanent priesthood for him and his descendants, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”
4486	4	25	14	25	14	The name of the Israelite who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.
4487	4	25	15	25	15	And the name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
4488	4	25	16	25	16	And the LORD said to Moses,
4489	4	25	17	25	17	“Attack the Midianites and strike them dead.
4490	4	25	18	25	18	For they assailed you deceitfully when they seduced you in the matter of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of the Midianite leader, the woman who was killed on the day the plague came because of Peor.”
4491	4	25	19	26	1	After the plague had ended,
4492	4	26	1	26	1	the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
4493	4	26	2	26	2	“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by the houses of their fathers—all those twenty years of age or older who can serve in the army of Israel.”
4494	4	26	3	26	3	So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued the instruction,
4495	4	26	4	26	4	“Take a census of the men twenty years of age or older, as the LORD has commanded Moses.” And these were the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt:
4496	4	26	5	26	5	Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. These were the descendants of Reuben: The Hanochite clan from Hanoch, the Palluite clan from Pallu,
4497	4	26	6	26	6	the Hezronite clan from Hezron, and the Carmite clan from Carmi.
4498	4	26	7	26	7	These were the clans of Reuben, and their registration numbered 43,730.
4499	4	26	8	26	8	Now the son of Pallu was Eliab,
4500	4	26	9	26	9	and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. It was Dathan and Abiram, chosen by the congregation, who fought against Moses and Aaron with the followers of Korah who rebelled against the LORD.
4501	4	26	10	26	10	And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire consumed 250 men. They serve as a warning sign.
4502	4	26	11	26	11	However, the line of Korah did not die out.
4503	4	26	12	26	12	These were the descendants of Simeon by their clans: The Nemuelite clan from Nemuel, the Jaminite clan from Jamin, the Jachinite clan from Jachin,
4504	4	26	13	26	13	the Zerahite clan from Zerah, and the Shaulite clan from Shaul.
4505	4	26	14	26	14	These were the clans of Simeon, and there were 22,200 men.
4506	4	26	15	26	15	These were the descendants of Gad by their clans: The Zephonite clan from Zephon, the Haggite clan from Haggi, the Shunite clan from Shuni,
4507	4	26	16	26	16	the Oznite clan from Ozni, the Erite clan from Eri,
4508	4	26	17	26	17	the Arodite clan from Arod, and the Arelite clan from Areli.
4509	4	26	18	26	18	These were the clans of Gad, and their registration numbered 40,500.
4510	4	26	19	26	19	The sons of Judah were Er and Onan, but they died in the land of Canaan.
4511	4	26	20	26	20	These were the descendants of Judah by their clans: The Shelanite clan from Shelah, the Perezite clan from Perez, and the Zerahite clan from Zerah.
4512	4	26	21	26	21	And these were the descendants of Perez: the Hezronite clan from Hezron and the Hamulite clan from Hamul.
4513	4	26	22	26	22	These were the clans of Judah, and their registration numbered 76,500.
4514	4	26	23	26	23	These were the descendants of Issachar by their clans: The Tolaite clan from Tola, the Punite clan from Puvah,
4515	4	26	24	26	24	the Jashubite clan from Jashub, and the Shimronite clan from Shimron.
4516	4	26	25	26	25	These were the clans of Issachar, and their registration numbered 64,300.
4517	4	26	26	26	26	These were the descendants of Zebulun by their clans: The Seredite clan from Sered, the Elonite clan from Elon, and the Jahleelite clan from Jahleel.
4518	4	26	27	26	27	These were the clans of Zebulun, and their registration numbered 60,500.
4519	4	26	28	26	28	The descendants of Joseph included the clans of Manasseh and Ephraim.
4520	4	26	29	26	29	These were the descendants of Manasseh: The Machirite clan from Machir, the father of Gilead, and the Gileadite clan from Gilead.
4521	4	26	30	26	30	These were the descendants of Gilead: the Iezerite clan from Iezer, the Helekite clan from Helek,
4522	4	26	31	26	31	the Asrielite clan from Asriel, the Shechemite clan from Shechem,
4523	4	26	32	26	32	the Shemidaite clan from Shemida, and the Hepherite clan from Hepher.
4524	4	26	33	26	33	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons—only daughters. The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
4525	4	26	34	26	34	These were the clans of Manasseh, and their registration numbered 52,700.
4526	4	26	35	26	35	These were the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: The Shuthelahite clan from Shuthelah, the Becherite clan from Becher, and the Tahanite clan from Tahan.
4527	4	26	36	26	36	And the descendants of Shuthelah were the Eranite clan from Eran.
4528	4	26	37	26	37	These were the clans of Ephraim, and their registration numbered 32,500. These clans were the descendants of Joseph.
4529	4	26	38	26	38	These were the descendants of Benjamin by their clans: The Belaite clan from Bela, the Ashbelite clan from Ashbel, the Ahiramite clan from Ahiram,
4530	4	26	39	26	39	the Shuphamite clan from Shupham, and the Huphamite clan from Hupham.
4531	4	26	40	26	40	And the descendants of Bela from Ard and Naaman were the Ardite clan from Ard and the Naamite clan from Naaman.
4532	4	26	41	26	41	These were the clans of Benjamin, and their registration numbered 45,600.
4533	4	26	42	26	42	These were the descendants of Dan by their clans: The Shuhamite clan from Shuham. These were the clans of Dan.
4534	4	26	43	26	43	All of them were Shuhamite clans, and their registration numbered 64,400.
4535	4	26	44	26	44	These were the descendants of Asher by their clans: The Imnite clan from Imnah, the Ishvite clan from Ishvi, and the Beriite clan from Beriah.
4536	4	26	45	26	45	And these were the descendants of Beriah: the Heberite clan from Heber and the Malchielite clan from Malchiel.
4537	4	26	46	26	46	And the name of Asher’s daughter was Serah.
4538	4	26	47	26	47	These were the clans of Asher, and their registration numbered 53,400.
4539	4	26	48	26	48	These were the descendants of Naphtali by their clans: The Jahzeelite clan from Jahzeel, the Gunite clan from Guni,
4540	4	26	49	26	49	the Jezerite clan from Jezer, and the Shillemite clan from Shillem.
4541	4	26	50	26	50	These were the clans of Naphtali, and their registration numbered 45,400.
4542	4	26	51	26	51	These men of Israel numbered 601,730 in all.
4543	4	26	52	26	52	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4544	4	26	53	26	53	“The land is to be divided among the tribes as an inheritance, according to the number of names.
4545	4	26	54	26	54	Increase the inheritance for a large tribe and decrease it for a small one; each tribe is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those registered.
4546	4	26	55	26	55	Indeed, the land must be divided by lot; they shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
4547	4	26	56	26	56	Each inheritance is to be divided by lot among the larger and smaller tribes.”
4548	4	26	57	26	57	Now these were the Levites registered by their clans: The Gershonite clan from Gershon, the Kohathite clan from Kohath, and the Merarite clan from Merari.
4549	4	26	58	26	58	These were the families of the Levites: The Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, and the Korahite clan. Now Kohath was the father of Amram,
4550	4	26	59	26	59	and Amram’s wife was named Jochebed. She was also a daughter of Levi, born to Levi in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.
4551	4	26	60	26	60	Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar were born to Aaron,
4552	4	26	61	26	61	but Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD.
4553	4	26	62	26	62	The registration of the Levites totaled 23,000, every male one month old or more; they were not registered among the other Israelites, because no inheritance was given to them among the Israelites.
4554	4	26	63	26	63	These were the ones registered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they numbered the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
4555	4	26	64	26	64	Among all these, however, there was not one who had been registered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai.
4556	4	26	65	26	65	For the LORD had told them that they would surely die in the wilderness. Not one was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
4557	4	27	1	27	1	Now the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They approached
4558	4	27	2	27	2	the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole congregation, and said,
4559	4	27	3	27	3	“Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the followers of Korah who gathered together against the LORD. Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons.
4560	4	27	4	27	4	Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan because he had no sons? Give us property among our father’s brothers.”
4561	4	27	5	27	5	So Moses brought their case before the LORD,
4562	4	27	6	27	6	and the LORD answered him,
4563	4	27	7	27	7	“The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly. You certainly must give them property as an inheritance among their father’s brothers, and transfer their father’s inheritance to them.
4564	4	27	8	27	8	Furthermore, you shall say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
4565	4	27	9	27	9	If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
4566	4	27	10	27	10	If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
4567	4	27	11	27	11	And if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the next of kin from his clan, that he may take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites, as the LORD has commanded Moses.’”
4568	4	27	12	27	12	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up this mountain of the Abarim range and see the land that I have given the Israelites.
4569	4	27	13	27	13	After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was;
4570	4	27	14	27	14	for when the congregation contended in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My command to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.” Those were the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin.
4571	4	27	15	27	15	So Moses appealed to the LORD,
4572	4	27	16	27	16	“May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
4573	4	27	17	27	17	who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”
4574	4	27	18	27	18	And the LORD replied to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man with the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him.
4575	4	27	19	27	19	Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation, and commission him in their sight.
4576	4	27	20	27	20	Confer on him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.
4577	4	27	21	27	21	He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel for him before the LORD by the judgment of the Urim. At his command he and all the Israelites with him, the entire congregation, will go out and come in.”
4578	4	27	22	27	22	Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. He took Joshua, had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
4579	4	27	23	27	23	and laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the LORD had instructed through Moses.
4580	4	28	1	28	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4581	4	28	2	28	2	“Command the Israelites and say to them: See that you present to Me at its appointed time the food for My offerings by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Me.
4582	4	28	3	28	3	And tell them that this is the offering by fire you are to present to the LORD as a regular burnt offering each day: two unblemished year-old male lambs.
4583	4	28	4	28	4	You are to offer one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight,
4584	4	28	5	28	5	along with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from pressed olives.
4585	4	28	6	28	6	This is a regular burnt offering established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
4586	4	28	7	28	7	And the drink offering accompanying each lamb shall be a quarter hin. Pour out the offering of fermented drink to the LORD in the sanctuary area.
4587	4	28	8	28	8	You are to offer the second lamb at twilight, with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering as in the morning. It is an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
4588	4	28	9	28	9	On the Sabbath day, present two unblemished year-old male lambs, accompanied by a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as well as a drink offering.
4589	4	28	10	28	10	This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
4590	4	28	11	28	11	At the beginning of every month, you are to present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished,
4591	4	28	12	28	12	along with three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each bull, two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for the ram,
4592	4	28	13	28	13	and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb. This is a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
4593	4	28	14	28	14	Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine with each bull, a third of a hin with the ram, and a quarter hin with each lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon throughout the year.
4594	4	28	15	28	15	In addition to the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering.
4595	4	28	16	28	16	The fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD’s Passover.
4596	4	28	17	28	17	On the fifteenth day of this month, there shall be a feast; for seven days unleavened bread is to be eaten.
4597	4	28	18	28	18	On the first day there is to be a sacred assembly; you are not to do any regular work.
4598	4	28	19	28	19	Present to the LORD an offering made by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old, all unblemished.
4599	4	28	20	28	20	The grain offering shall consist of fine flour mixed with oil; offer three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram,
4600	4	28	21	28	21	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs.
4601	4	28	22	28	22	Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you.
4602	4	28	23	28	23	You are to present these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering.
4603	4	28	24	28	24	Offer the same food each day for seven days as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It is to be offered with its drink offering and the regular burnt offering.
4604	4	28	25	28	25	On the seventh day you shall hold a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work.
4605	4	28	26	28	26	On the day of firstfruits, when you present an offering of new grain to the LORD during the Feast of Weeks, you are to hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any regular work.
4606	4	28	27	28	27	Present a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old as a pleasing aroma to the LORD,
4607	4	28	28	28	28	together with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil—three-tenths of an ephah with each bull, two-tenths of an ephah with the ram,
4608	4	28	29	28	29	and a tenth of an ephah with each of the seven lambs.
4609	4	28	30	28	30	Include one male goat to make atonement for you.
4610	4	28	31	28	31	Offer them with their drink offerings in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering. The animals must be unblemished.”

4650	4	30	1	29	40	So Moses spoke all this to the Israelites just as the LORD had commanded him.
4651	4	30	2	30	1	Then Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded:
4652	4	30	3	30	2	If a man makes a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word; he must do everything he has promised.
4653	4	30	4	30	3	And if a woman in her father’s house during her youth makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge,
4654	4	30	5	30	4	and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, all the vows and pledges with which she has bound herself shall stand.
4655	4	30	6	30	5	But if her father prohibits her on the day he hears about it, none of the vows or pledges with which she has bound herself are binding. The LORD will absolve her because her father has prohibited her.
4656	4	30	7	30	6	If a woman marries while under a vow or rash promise by which she has bound herself,
4657	4	30	8	30	7	and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her on that day, then the vows and pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand.
4658	4	30	9	30	8	But if her husband prohibits her when he hears of it, he nullifies the vow that binds her or the rash promise she has made, and the LORD will absolve her.
4659	4	30	10	30	9	Every vow a widow or divorced woman pledges to fulfill is binding on her.
4660	4	30	11	30	10	If a woman in her husband’s house has made a vow or put herself under an obligation with an oath,
4661	4	30	12	30	11	and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her and does not prohibit her, then all the vows and obligations with which she has bound herself shall stand.
4662	4	30	13	30	12	But if her husband nullifies them on the day he hears of them, then nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or her obligations, shall stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will absolve her.
4663	4	30	14	30	13	Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow or any sworn pledge to deny herself.
4664	4	30	15	30	14	But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he confirms all the vows and pledges that bind her. He has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her on the day he heard about them.
4665	4	30	16	30	15	But if he nullifies them after he hears of them, then he will bear her iniquity.”
4666	4	30	17	30	16	These are the statutes that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the relationship between a man and his wife, and between a father and a young daughter still in his home.
4667	4	31	1	31	1	And the LORD said to Moses,
4668	4	31	2	31	2	“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”
4669	4	31	3	31	3	So Moses told the people, “Arm some of your men for war, that they may go against the Midianites and execute the LORD’s vengeance on them.
4670	4	31	4	31	4	Send into battle a thousand men from each tribe of Israel.”
4671	4	31	5	31	5	So a thousand men were recruited from each tribe of Israel—twelve thousand armed for war.
4672	4	31	6	31	6	And Moses sent the thousand from each tribe into battle, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
4673	4	31	7	31	7	Then they waged war against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male.
4674	4	31	8	31	8	Among the slain were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
4675	4	31	9	31	9	The Israelites captured the Midianite women and their children, and they plundered all their herds, flocks, and goods.
4676	4	31	10	31	10	Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites had lived, as well as all their encampments,
4677	4	31	11	31	11	and carried away all the plunder and spoils, both people and animals.
4678	4	31	12	31	12	They brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
4679	4	31	13	31	13	And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
4680	4	31	14	31	14	But Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who were returning from the battle.
4681	4	31	15	31	15	“Have you spared all the women?” he asked them.
4682	4	31	16	31	16	“Look, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD.
4683	4	31	17	31	17	So now, kill all the boys, as well as every woman who has had relations with a man,
4684	4	31	18	31	18	but spare for yourselves every girl who has never had relations with a man.
4685	4	31	19	31	19	All of you who have killed a person or touched the dead are to remain outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and the seventh day you are to purify both yourselves and your captives.
4686	4	31	20	31	20	And purify every garment and leather good, everything made of goat’s hair, and every article of wood.”
4687	4	31	21	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses:
4688	4	31	22	31	22	Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead—
4689	4	31	23	31	23	everything that can withstand the fire—must be put through the fire, and it will be clean. But it must still be purified with the water of purification. And everything that cannot withstand the fire must pass through the water.
4690	4	31	24	31	24	On the seventh day you are to wash your clothes, and you will be clean. After that you may enter the camp.”
4691	4	31	25	31	25	The LORD said to Moses,
4692	4	31	26	31	26	“You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the congregation are to take a count of what was captured, both of man and beast.
4693	4	31	27	31	27	Then divide the captives between the troops who went out to battle and the rest of the congregation.
4694	4	31	28	31	28	Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what belongs to the soldiers who went into battle: one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, or sheep.
4695	4	31	29	31	29	Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
4696	4	31	30	31	30	From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or other animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.”
4697	4	31	31	31	31	So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD had commanded Moses,
4698	4	31	32	31	32	and this plunder remained from the spoils the soldiers had taken: 675,000 sheep,
4699	4	31	33	31	33	72,000 cattle,
4700	4	31	34	31	34	61,000 donkeys,
4701	4	31	35	31	35	and 32,000 women who had not slept with a man.
4702	4	31	36	31	36	This was the half portion for those who had gone to war: 337,500 sheep,
4703	4	31	37	31	37	including a tribute to the LORD of 675,
4704	4	31	38	31	38	36,000 cattle, including a tribute to the LORD of 72,
4705	4	31	39	31	39	30,500 donkeys, including a tribute to the LORD of 61,
4706	4	31	40	31	40	and 16,000 people, including a tribute to the LORD of 32.
4707	4	31	41	31	41	Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as an offering for the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
4708	4	31	42	31	42	From the Israelites’ half, which Moses had set apart from the men who had gone to war,
4709	4	31	43	31	43	this half belonged to the congregation: 337,500 sheep,
4710	4	31	44	31	44	36,000 cattle,
4711	4	31	45	31	45	30,500 donkeys,
4712	4	31	46	31	46	and 16,000 people.
4713	4	31	47	31	47	From the Israelites’ half, Moses took one out of every fifty persons and animals and gave them to the Levites who kept charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD had commanded him.
4714	4	31	48	31	48	Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and of hundreds—approached Moses
4715	4	31	49	31	49	and said, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one of us is missing.
4716	4	31	50	31	50	So we have brought to the LORD an offering of the gold articles each man acquired—armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”
4717	4	31	51	31	51	So Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them all the articles made out of gold.
4718	4	31	52	31	52	All the gold that the commanders of thousands and of hundreds presented as an offering to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels.
4719	4	31	53	31	53	Each of the soldiers had taken plunder for himself.
4720	4	31	54	31	54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
4721	4	32	1	32	1	Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock.
4722	4	32	2	32	2	So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, and said,
4723	4	32	3	32	3	“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,
4724	4	32	4	32	4	which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, are suitable for livestock—and your servants have livestock.”
4725	4	32	5	32	5	“If we have found favor in your sight,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
4726	4	32	6	32	6	But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?
4727	4	32	7	32	7	Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land that the LORD has given them?
4728	4	32	8	32	8	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land.
4729	4	32	9	32	9	For when your fathers went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land that the LORD had given them.
4730	4	32	10	32	10	So the LORD’s anger was kindled that day, and He swore an oath, saying,
4731	4	32	11	32	11	‘Because they did not follow Me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years of age or older who came out of Egypt will see the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—
4732	4	32	12	32	12	not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun—because they did follow the LORD wholeheartedly.’
4733	4	32	13	32	13	The LORD’s anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation who had done evil in His sight was gone.
4734	4	32	14	32	14	Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have risen up in place of your fathers to further stoke the burning anger of the LORD against Israel.
4735	4	32	15	32	15	For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”
4736	4	32	16	32	16	Then the Gadites and Reubenites approached Moses and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones.
4737	4	32	17	32	17	But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
4738	4	32	18	32	18	We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance.
4739	4	32	19	32	19	Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”
4740	4	32	20	32	20	Moses replied, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,
4741	4	32	21	32	21	and if every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD, until He has driven His enemies out before Him,
4742	4	32	22	32	22	then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD.
4743	4	32	23	32	23	But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD—and be assured that your sin will find you out.
4744	4	32	24	32	24	Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”
4745	4	32	25	32	25	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as our lord commands.
4746	4	32	26	32	26	Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead.
4747	4	32	27	32	27	But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord says.”
4748	4	32	28	32	28	So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel.
4749	4	32	29	32	29	And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession.
4750	4	32	30	32	30	But if they do not arm themselves and go across with you, they must accept their possession among you in the land of Canaan.”
4751	4	32	31	32	31	The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do.
4752	4	32	32	32	32	We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.”
4753	4	32	33	32	33	So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them.
4754	4	32	34	32	34	And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
4755	4	32	35	32	35	Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
4756	4	32	36	32	36	Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks.
4757	4	32	37	32	37	The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
4758	4	32	38	32	38	as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt.
4759	4	32	39	32	39	The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there.
4760	4	32	40	32	40	So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled there.
4761	4	32	41	32	41	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair.
4762	4	32	42	32	42	And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name.
4763	4	33	1	33	1	These are the journeys of the Israelites as they came out of the land of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
4764	4	33	2	33	2	At the LORD’s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey. These are the stages listed by their starting points:
4765	4	33	3	33	3	On the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the Passover, the Israelites set out from Rameses. They marched out triumphantly in full view of all the Egyptians,
4766	4	33	4	33	4	who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods.
4767	4	33	5	33	5	The Israelites set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
4768	4	33	6	33	6	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
4769	4	33	7	33	7	They set out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon, and they camped near Migdol.
4770	4	33	8	33	8	They set out from Pi-hahiroth and crossed through the sea, into the wilderness, and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
4771	4	33	9	33	9	They set out from Marah and came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
4772	4	33	10	33	10	They set out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
4773	4	33	11	33	11	They set out from the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
4774	4	33	12	33	12	They set out from the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
4775	4	33	13	33	13	They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
4776	4	33	14	33	14	They set out from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
4777	4	33	15	33	15	They set out from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.
4778	4	33	16	33	16	They set out from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
4779	4	33	17	33	17	They set out from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
4780	4	33	18	33	18	They set out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
4781	4	33	19	33	19	They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
4782	4	33	20	33	20	They set out from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
4783	4	33	21	33	21	They set out from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
4784	4	33	22	33	22	They set out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
4785	4	33	23	33	23	They set out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
4786	4	33	24	33	24	They set out from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
4787	4	33	25	33	25	They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
4788	4	33	26	33	26	They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
4789	4	33	27	33	27	They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah.
4790	4	33	28	33	28	They set out from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
4791	4	33	29	33	29	They set out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
4792	4	33	30	33	30	They set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
4793	4	33	31	33	31	They set out from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
4794	4	33	32	33	32	They set out from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
4795	4	33	33	33	33	They set out from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
4796	4	33	34	33	34	They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
4797	4	33	35	33	35	They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
4798	4	33	36	33	36	They set out from Ezion-geber and camped at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.
4799	4	33	37	33	37	They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom.
4800	4	33	38	33	38	At the LORD’s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first day of the fifth month, in the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt.
4801	4	33	39	33	39	Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
4802	4	33	40	33	40	Now the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.
4803	4	33	41	33	41	And the Israelites set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
4804	4	33	42	33	42	They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
4805	4	33	43	33	43	They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth.
4806	4	33	44	33	44	They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab.
4807	4	33	45	33	45	They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
4808	4	33	46	33	46	They set out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
4809	4	33	47	33	47	They set out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim facing Nebo.
4810	4	33	48	33	48	They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
4811	4	33	49	33	49	And there on the plains of Moab they camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim.
4812	4	33	50	33	50	On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
4813	4	33	51	33	51	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
4814	4	33	52	33	52	you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high places.
4815	4	33	53	33	53	You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
4816	4	33	54	33	54	And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.
4817	4	33	55	33	55	But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle.
4818	4	33	56	33	56	And then I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.”
4819	4	34	1	34	1	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4820	4	34	2	34	2	“Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, it will be allotted to you as an inheritance with these boundaries:
4821	4	34	3	34	3	Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea,
4822	4	34	4	34	4	cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon,
4823	4	34	5	34	5	where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea.
4824	4	34	6	34	6	Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west.
4825	4	34	7	34	7	Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor,
4826	4	34	8	34	8	and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad,
4827	4	34	9	34	9	continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
4828	4	34	10	34	10	And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham,
4829	4	34	11	34	11	then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth.
4830	4	34	12	34	12	Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”
4831	4	34	13	34	13	So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes.
4832	4	34	14	34	14	For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance.
4833	4	34	15	34	15	These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
4834	4	34	16	34	16	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4835	4	34	17	34	17	“These are the names of the men who are to assign the land as an inheritance for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
4836	4	34	18	34	18	Appoint one leader from each tribe to distribute the land.
4837	4	34	19	34	19	These are their names: Caleb son of Jephunneh from the tribe of Judah;
4838	4	34	20	34	20	Shemuel son of Ammihud from the tribe of Simeon;
4839	4	34	21	34	21	Elidad son of Chislon from the tribe of Benjamin;
4840	4	34	22	34	22	Bukki son of Jogli, a leader from the tribe of Dan;
4841	4	34	23	34	23	Hanniel son of Ephod, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;
4842	4	34	24	34	24	Kemuel son of Shiphtan, a leader from the tribe of Ephraim;
4843	4	34	25	34	25	Eli-zaphan son of Parnach, a leader from the tribe of Zebulun;
4844	4	34	26	34	26	Paltiel son of Azzan, a leader from the tribe of Issachar;
4845	4	34	27	34	27	Ahihud son of Shelomi, a leader from the tribe of Asher;
4846	4	34	28	34	28	and Pedahel son of Ammihud, a leader from the tribe of Naphtali.”
4847	4	34	29	34	29	These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to apportion the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
4848	4	35	1	35	1	Again the LORD spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho:
4849	4	35	2	35	2	“Command the Israelites to give, from the inheritance they will possess, cities for the Levites to live in and pasturelands around the cities.
4850	4	35	3	35	3	The cities will be for them to live in, and the pasturelands will be for their herds, their flocks, and all their other livestock.
4851	4	35	4	35	4	The pasturelands around the cities you are to give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits from the wall on every side.
4852	4	35	5	35	5	You are also to measure two thousand cubits outside the city on the east, two thousand on the south, two thousand on the west, and two thousand on the north, with the city in the center. These areas will serve as larger pasturelands for the cities.
4853	4	35	6	35	6	Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be appointed as cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. In addition to these, give the Levites forty-two other cities.
4854	4	35	7	35	7	The total number of cities you give the Levites will be forty-eight, with their corresponding pasturelands.
4855	4	35	8	35	8	The cities that you apportion from the territory of the Israelites should be given to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: more from a larger tribe and less from a smaller one.”
4856	4	35	9	35	9	Then the LORD said to Moses,
4857	4	35	10	35	10	“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
4858	4	35	11	35	11	designate cities to serve as your cities of refuge, so that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there.
4859	4	35	12	35	12	You are to have these cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly.
4860	4	35	13	35	13	The cities you select will be your six cities of refuge.
4861	4	35	14	35	14	Select three cities across the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge.
4862	4	35	15	35	15	These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or stranger among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.
4863	4	35	16	35	16	If, however, anyone strikes a person with an iron object and kills him, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death.
4864	4	35	17	35	17	Or if anyone has in his hand a stone of deadly size, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death.
4865	4	35	18	35	18	If anyone has in his hand a deadly object of wood, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death.
4866	4	35	19	35	19	The avenger of blood is to put the murderer to death; when he finds him, he is to kill him.
4867	4	35	20	35	20	Likewise, if anyone maliciously pushes another or intentionally throws an object at him and kills him,
4868	4	35	21	35	21	or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must surely be put to death; he is a murderer. When the avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him.
4869	4	35	22	35	22	But if anyone pushes a person suddenly, without hostility, or throws an object at him unintentionally,
4870	4	35	23	35	23	or without looking drops a heavy stone that kills him, but he was not an enemy and did not intend to harm him,
4871	4	35	24	35	24	then the congregation must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.
4872	4	35	25	35	25	The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
4873	4	35	26	35	26	But if the manslayer ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he fled
4874	4	35	27	35	27	and the avenger of blood finds him outside of his city of refuge and kills him, then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed
4875	4	35	28	35	28	because the manslayer must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns.
4876	4	35	29	35	29	This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to come, wherever you live.
4877	4	35	30	35	30	If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death on the testimony of the witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of a lone witness.
4878	4	35	31	35	31	You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die; he must surely be put to death.
4879	4	35	32	35	32	Nor should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to a city of refuge and allow him to return and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.
4880	4	35	33	35	33	Do not pollute the land where you live, for bloodshed pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which the blood is shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
4881	4	35	34	35	34	Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell. For I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.”
4882	4	36	1	36	1	Now the family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, one of the clans of Joseph, approached and addressed Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families,
4883	4	36	2	36	2	saying, “When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, He also commanded him to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
4884	4	36	3	36	3	But if they marry any of the men from the other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of our fathers and added to the tribe into which they marry. So our allotted inheritance would be taken away.
4885	4	36	4	36	4	And when the Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry and taken away from the tribe of our fathers.”
4886	4	36	5	36	5	So at the word of the LORD, Moses commanded the Israelites: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly.
4887	4	36	6	36	6	This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please, provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father.
4888	4	36	7	36	7	No inheritance in Israel may be transferred from tribe to tribe, because each of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
4889	4	36	8	36	8	Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from any Israelite tribe must marry within a clan of the tribe of her father, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
4890	4	36	9	36	9	No inheritance may be transferred from one tribe to another, for each tribe of Israel must retain its inheritance.”
4891	4	36	10	36	10	So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
4892	4	36	11	36	11	Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to cousins on their father’s side.
4893	4	36	12	36	12	They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father’s clan.
4894	4	36	13	36	13	These are the commandments and ordinances that the LORD gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
4895	5	1	1	1	1	These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—in the Arabah opposite Suph—between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
4896	5	1	2	1	2	It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
4897	5	1	3	1	3	In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites everything that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.
4898	5	1	4	1	4	This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
4899	5	1	5	1	5	On the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:
4900	5	1	6	1	6	The LORD our God said to us at Horeb: “You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
4901	5	1	7	1	7	Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills, in the Negev, and along the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.
4902	5	1	8	1	8	See, I have placed the land before you. Enter and possess the land that the LORD swore He would give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.”
4903	5	1	9	1	9	At that time I said to you, “I cannot carry the burden for you alone.
4904	5	1	10	1	10	The LORD your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
4905	5	1	11	1	11	May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over and bless you as He has promised.
4906	5	1	12	1	12	But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself?
4907	5	1	13	1	13	Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.”
4908	5	1	14	1	14	And you answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.”
4909	5	1	15	1	15	So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for your tribes.
4910	5	1	16	1	16	At that time I charged your judges: “Hear the disputes between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident.
4911	5	1	17	1	17	Show no partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.”
4912	5	1	18	1	18	And at that time I commanded you all the things you were to do.
4913	5	1	19	1	19	And just as the LORD our God had commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness you have seen. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,
4914	5	1	20	1	20	I said: “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
4915	5	1	21	1	21	See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”
4916	5	1	22	1	22	Then all of you approached me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land and bring us word of what route to follow and which cities to enter.”
4917	5	1	23	1	23	The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.
4918	5	1	24	1	24	They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied out the land.
4919	5	1	25	1	25	They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us word: “It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.”
4920	5	1	26	1	26	But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
4921	5	1	27	1	27	You grumbled in your tents and said, “Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be annihilated.
4922	5	1	28	1	28	Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying: ‘The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the heavens. We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’”
4923	5	1	29	1	29	So I said to you: “Do not be terrified or afraid of them!
4924	5	1	30	1	30	The LORD your God, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt
4925	5	1	31	1	31	and in the wilderness, where the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way by which you traveled until you reached this place.”
4926	5	1	32	1	32	But in spite of all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,
4927	5	1	33	1	33	who went before you on the journey, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, to seek out a place for you to camp and to show you the road to travel.
4928	5	1	34	1	34	When the LORD heard your words, He grew angry and swore an oath, saying,
4929	5	1	35	1	35	“Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your fathers,
4930	5	1	36	1	36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.”
4931	5	1	37	1	37	The LORD was also angry with me on your account, and He said, “Not even you shall enter the land.
4932	5	1	38	1	38	Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit the land.
4933	5	1	39	1	39	And the little ones you said would become captives—your children who on that day did not know good from evil—will enter the land that I will give them, and they will possess it.
4934	5	1	40	1	40	But you are to turn back and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.”
4935	5	1	41	1	41	“We have sinned against the LORD,” you replied. “We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God has commanded us.” Then each of you put on his weapons of war, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.
4936	5	1	42	1	42	But the LORD said to me, “Tell them not to go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from defeat by your enemies.”
4937	5	1	43	1	43	So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
4938	5	1	44	1	44	Then the Amorites who lived in the hills came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir all the way to Hormah.
4939	5	1	45	1	45	And you returned and wept before the LORD, but He would not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
4940	5	1	46	1	46	For this reason you stayed in Kadesh for a long time—a very long time.
4941	5	2	1	2	1	Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had instructed me, and for many days we wandered around Mount Seir.
4942	5	2	2	2	2	At this time the LORD said to me,
4943	5	2	3	2	3	“You have been wandering around this hill country long enough; turn to the north
4944	5	2	4	2	4	and command the people: ‘You will pass through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful.
4945	5	2	5	2	5	Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession.
4946	5	2	6	2	6	You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.’”
4947	5	2	7	2	7	Indeed, the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you these forty years, and you have lacked nothing.
4948	5	2	8	2	8	So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber, and traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab.
4949	5	2	9	2	9	Then the LORD said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.”
4950	5	2	10	2	10	(The Emites used to live there, a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites.
4951	5	2	11	2	11	Like the Anakites, they were also regarded as Rephaim, though the Moabites called them Emites.
4952	5	2	12	2	12	The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as their possession.)
4953	5	2	13	2	13	“Now arise and cross over the Brook of Zered.” So we crossed over the Brook of Zered.
4954	5	2	14	2	14	The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Brook of Zered was thirty-eight years, until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
4955	5	2	15	2	15	Indeed, the LORD’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp, until they had all perished.
4956	5	2	16	2	16	Now when all the fighting men among the people had died,
4957	5	2	17	2	17	the LORD said to me,
4958	5	2	18	2	18	“Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
4959	5	2	19	2	19	But when you get close to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites. I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.”
4960	5	2	20	2	20	(That too was regarded as the land of the Rephaim, who used to live there, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
4961	5	2	21	2	21	They were a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites. But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place,
4962	5	2	22	2	22	just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
4963	5	2	23	2	23	And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor and settled in their place.)
4964	5	2	24	2	24	“Arise, set out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.
4965	5	2	25	2	25	This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon all the nations under heaven. They will hear the reports of you and tremble in anguish because of you.”
4966	5	2	26	2	26	So from the Wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon, saying,
4967	5	2	27	2	27	“Let us pass through your land; we will stay on the main road. We will not turn to the right or to the left.
4968	5	2	28	2	28	You can sell us food to eat and water to drink in exchange for silver. Only let us pass through on foot,
4969	5	2	29	2	29	just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.”
4970	5	2	30	2	30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate, that He might give him into your hands, as is the case this day.
4971	5	2	31	2	31	Then the LORD said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”
4972	5	2	32	2	32	So Sihon and his whole army came out for battle against us at Jahaz.
4973	5	2	33	2	33	And the LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army.
4974	5	2	34	2	34	At that time we captured all his cities and devoted to destruction the people of every city, including women and children. We left no survivors.
4975	5	2	35	2	35	We carried off for ourselves only the livestock and the plunder from the cities we captured.
4976	5	2	36	2	36	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead, not one city had walls too high for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.
4977	5	2	37	2	37	But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or the land along the banks of the Jabbok River, or the cities of the hill country, or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden.
4978	5	3	1	3	1	Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
4979	5	3	2	3	2	But the LORD said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
4980	5	3	3	3	3	So the LORD our God also delivered Og king of Bashan and his whole army into our hands. We struck them down until no survivor was left.
4981	5	3	4	3	4	At that time we captured all sixty of his cities. There was not a single city we failed to take—the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
4982	5	3	5	3	5	All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages.
4983	5	3	6	3	6	We devoted them to destruction, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
4984	5	3	7	3	7	But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves.
4985	5	3	8	3	8	At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon—
4986	5	3	9	3	9	which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites call Senir—
4987	5	3	10	3	10	all the cities of the plateau, all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og.
4988	5	3	11	3	11	(For only Og king of Bashan had remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed of iron, nine cubits long and four cubits wide, is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
4989	5	3	12	3	12	So at that time we took possession of this land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer along the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities.
4990	5	3	13	3	13	To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.)
4991	5	3	14	3	14	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, by which it is called to this day.
4992	5	3	15	3	15	To Machir I gave Gilead,
4993	5	3	16	3	16	and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.
4994	5	3	17	3	17	The Jordan River in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
4995	5	3	18	3	18	At that time I commanded you: “The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of your brothers, the Israelites.
4996	5	3	19	3	19	But your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—may remain in the cities I have given you,
4997	5	3	20	3	20	until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the possession I have given you.”
4998	5	3	21	3	21	And at that time I commanded Joshua: “Your own eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
4999	5	3	22	3	22	Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God Himself will fight for you.”
5000	5	3	23	3	23	At that time I also pleaded with the LORD:
5001	5	3	24	3	24	“O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to Your servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can perform such works and mighty acts as Yours?
5002	5	3	25	3	25	Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that pleasant hill country as well as Lebanon!”
5003	5	3	26	3	26	But the LORD was angry with me on account of you, and He would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the LORD said to me. “Do not speak to Me again about this matter.
5004	5	3	27	3	27	Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west and north and south and east. See the land with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.
5005	5	3	28	3	28	But commission Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.”
5006	5	3	29	3	29	So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
5007	5	4	1	4	1	Hear now, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances I am teaching you to follow, so that you may live and may enter and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
5008	5	4	2	4	2	You must not add to or subtract from what I command you, so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you.
5009	5	4	3	4	3	Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all who followed Baal of Peor.
5010	5	4	4	4	4	But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive to this day, every one of you.
5011	5	4	5	4	5	See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
5012	5	4	6	4	6	Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the peoples, who will hear of all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”
5013	5	4	7	4	7	For what nation is so great as to have a god as near to them as the LORD our God is to us whenever we call on Him?
5014	5	4	8	4	8	And what nation is so great as to have righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today?
5015	5	4	9	4	9	Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen, and so that they do not slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren.
5016	5	4	10	4	10	The day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, “Gather the people before Me to hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach them to their children.”
5017	5	4	11	4	11	You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire to the heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.
5018	5	4	12	4	12	And the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; there was only a voice.
5019	5	4	13	4	13	He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to follow—the Ten Commandments that He wrote on two tablets of stone.
5020	5	4	14	4	14	At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you the statutes and ordinances you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
5021	5	4	15	4	15	So since you saw no form of any kind on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb, be careful
5022	5	4	16	4	16	that you do not act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves of any form or shape, whether in the likeness of a male or female,
5023	5	4	17	4	17	of any beast on the earth or bird that flies in the air,
5024	5	4	18	4	18	or of any creature that crawls on the ground or fish in the waters below.
5025	5	4	19	4	19	When you look to the heavens and see the sun and moon and stars—all the host of heaven—do not be enticed to bow down and worship what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.
5026	5	4	20	4	20	Yet the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of His inheritance, as you are today.
5027	5	4	21	4	21	The LORD, however, was angry with me on account of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan to enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5028	5	4	22	4	22	For I will not be crossing the Jordan, because I must die in this land. But you shall cross over and take possession of that good land.
5029	5	4	23	4	23	Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you; do not make an idol for yourselves in the form of anything He has forbidden you.
5030	5	4	24	4	24	For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
5031	5	4	25	4	25	After you have children and grandchildren and you have been in the land a long time, if you then act corruptly and make an idol of any form—doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God and provoking Him to anger—
5032	5	4	26	4	26	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed.
5033	5	4	27	4	27	Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.
5034	5	4	28	4	28	And there you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
5035	5	4	29	4	29	But if from there you will seek the LORD your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
5036	5	4	30	4	30	When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice.
5037	5	4	31	4	31	For the LORD your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers, which He swore to them by oath.
5038	5	4	32	4	32	Indeed, ask now from one end of the heavens to the other about the days that long preceded you, from the day that God created man on earth: Has anything as great as this ever happened or been reported?
5039	5	4	33	4	33	Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and lived?
5040	5	4	34	4	34	Or has any god tried to take as his own a nation out of another nation—by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors—as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, before your eyes?
5041	5	4	35	4	35	You were shown these things so that you would know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him.
5042	5	4	36	4	36	He let you hear His voice from heaven to discipline you, and on earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words out of the fire.
5043	5	4	37	4	37	Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power,
5044	5	4	38	4	38	to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, and to bring you into their land and give it as your inheritance, as it is today.
5045	5	4	39	4	39	Know therefore this day and take to heart that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.
5046	5	4	40	4	40	Keep His statutes and commandments, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper, and that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time.
5047	5	4	41	4	41	Then Moses set aside three cities across the Jordan to the east
5048	5	4	42	4	42	to which a manslayer could flee after killing his neighbor unintentionally without prior malice. To save one‘s own life, he could flee to one of these cities:
5049	5	4	43	4	43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau belonging to the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead belonging to the Gadites, or Golan in Bashan belonging to the Manassites.
5050	5	4	44	4	44	This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.
5051	5	4	45	4	45	These are the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they had come out of Egypt,
5052	5	4	46	4	46	while they were in the valley across the Jordan facing Beth-peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt.
5053	5	4	47	4	47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan—the two Amorite kings across the Jordan to the east—
5054	5	4	48	4	48	extending from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Siyon (that is, Hermon),
5055	5	4	49	4	49	including all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
5056	5	5	1	5	1	Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances that I declare in your hearing this day. Learn them and observe them carefully.
5057	5	5	2	5	2	The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
5058	5	5	3	5	3	He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with all of us who are alive here today.
5059	5	5	4	5	4	The LORD spoke with you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
5060	5	5	5	5	5	At that time I was standing between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain. And He said:
5061	5	5	6	5	6	“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
5062	5	5	7	5	7	You shall have no other gods before Me.
5063	5	5	8	5	8	You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.
5064	5	5	9	5	9	You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
5065	5	5	10	5	10	but showing loving devotion to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
5066	5	5	11	5	11	You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who takes His name in vain.
5067	5	5	12	5	12	Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
5068	5	5	13	5	13	Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
5069	5	5	14	5	14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox or donkey or any of your livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do.
5070	5	5	15	5	15	Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
5071	5	5	16	5	16	Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
5072	5	5	17	5	17	You shall not murder.
5073	5	5	18	5	18	You shall not commit adultery.
5074	5	5	19	5	19	You shall not steal.
5075	5	5	20	5	20	You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
5076	5	5	21	5	21	You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house or field, or his manservant or maidservant, or his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
5077	5	5	22	5	22	The LORD spoke these commandments in a loud voice to your whole assembly out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness on the mountain; He added nothing more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
5078	5	5	23	5	23	And when you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was blazing with fire, all the heads of your tribes and your elders approached me,
5079	5	5	24	5	24	and you said, “Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him.
5080	5	5	25	5	25	But now, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us, and we will die, if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer.
5081	5	5	26	5	26	For who of all flesh has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire, as we have, and survived?
5082	5	5	27	5	27	Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen and obey.”
5083	5	5	28	5	28	And the LORD heard the words you spoke to me, and He said to me, “I have heard the words that these people have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
5084	5	5	29	5	29	If only they had such a heart to fear Me and keep all My commandments always, so that it might be well with them and with their children forever.
5085	5	5	30	5	30	Go and tell them: ‘Return to your tents.’
5086	5	5	31	5	31	But you stand here with Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and statutes and ordinances you are to teach them to follow in the land that I am giving them to possess.”
5087	5	5	32	5	32	So be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or to the left.
5088	5	5	33	5	33	You must walk in all the ways that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
5089	5	6	1	6	1	These are the commandments and statutes and ordinances that the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you to follow in the land that you are about to enter and possess,
5090	5	6	2	6	2	so that you and your children and grandchildren may fear the LORD your God all the days of your lives by keeping all His statutes and commandments that I give you, and so that your days may be prolonged.
5091	5	6	3	6	3	Hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe them, so that you may prosper and multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
5092	5	6	4	6	4	Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One.
5093	5	6	5	6	5	And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
5094	5	6	6	6	6	These words I am commanding you today are to be upon your hearts.
5095	5	6	7	6	7	And you shall teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
5096	5	6	8	6	8	Tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
5097	5	6	9	6	9	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.
5098	5	6	10	6	10	And when the LORD your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that He would give you—a land with great and splendid cities that you did not build,
5099	5	6	11	6	11	with houses full of every good thing with which you did not fill them, with wells that you did not dig, and with vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and when you eat and are satisfied,
5100	5	6	12	6	12	be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
5101	5	6	13	6	13	Fear the LORD your God, serve Him only, and take your oaths in His name.
5102	5	6	14	6	14	Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you.
5103	5	6	15	6	15	For the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God. Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.
5104	5	6	16	6	16	Do not test the LORD your God as you tested Him at Massah.
5105	5	6	17	6	17	You are to diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God and the testimonies and statutes He has given you.
5106	5	6	18	6	18	Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, so that it may be well with you and that you may enter and possess the good land that the LORD your God swore to give your fathers,
5107	5	6	19	6	19	driving out all your enemies before you, as the LORD has said.
5108	5	6	20	6	20	In the future, when your son asks, “What is the meaning of the decrees and statutes and ordinances that the LORD our God has commanded you?”
5109	5	6	21	6	21	then you are to tell him, “We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
5110	5	6	22	6	22	Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his household.
5111	5	6	23	6	23	But He brought us out from there to lead us in and give us the land that He had sworn to our fathers.
5112	5	6	24	6	24	And the LORD commanded us to observe all these statutes and to fear the LORD our God, that we may always be prosperous and preserved, as we are to this day.
5113	5	6	25	6	25	And if we are careful to observe every one of these commandments before the LORD our God, as He has commanded us, then that will be our righteousness.”
5114	5	7	1	7	1	When the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to possess, and He drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you—
5115	5	7	2	7	2	and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you to defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.
5116	5	7	3	7	3	Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
5117	5	7	4	7	4	because they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and He will swiftly destroy you.
5118	5	7	5	7	5	Instead, this is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire.
5119	5	7	6	7	6	For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His prized possession, above all peoples on the face of the earth.
5120	5	7	7	7	7	The LORD did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
5121	5	7	8	7	8	But because the LORD loved you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers, He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
5122	5	7	9	7	9	Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion for a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments.
5123	5	7	10	7	10	But those who hate Him He repays to their faces with destruction; He will not hesitate to repay to his face the one who hates Him.
5124	5	7	11	7	11	So keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances that I am giving you to follow this day.
5125	5	7	12	7	12	If you listen to these ordinances and keep them carefully, then the LORD your God will keep His covenant and the loving devotion that He swore to your fathers.
5126	5	7	13	7	13	He will love you and bless you and multiply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb and the produce of your land—your grain, new wine, and oil—the young of your herds and the lambs of your flocks, in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you.
5127	5	7	14	7	14	You will be blessed above all peoples; among you there will be no barren man or woman or livestock.
5128	5	7	15	7	15	And the LORD will remove from you all sickness. He will not lay upon you any of the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but He will inflict them on all who hate you.
5129	5	7	16	7	16	You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God will deliver to you. Do not look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
5130	5	7	17	7	17	You may say in your heart, “These nations are greater than we are; how can we drive them out?”
5131	5	7	18	7	18	But do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
5132	5	7	19	7	19	the great trials that you saw, the signs and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
5133	5	7	20	7	20	Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet against them until all the survivors and those hiding from you have perished.
5134	5	7	21	7	21	Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
5135	5	7	22	7	22	The LORD your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be enabled to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals would multiply around you.
5136	5	7	23	7	23	But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them into great confusion, until they are destroyed.
5137	5	7	24	7	24	He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate them.
5138	5	7	25	7	25	You must burn up the images of their gods; do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it; for it is detestable to the LORD your God.
5139	5	7	26	7	26	And you must not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. You are to utterly detest and abhor it, because it is set apart for destruction.
5140	5	8	1	8	1	You must carefully follow every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply, and enter and possess the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers.
5141	5	8	2	8	2	Remember that these forty years the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commandments.
5142	5	8	3	8	3	He humbled you, and in your hunger He gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
5143	5	8	4	8	4	Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
5144	5	8	5	8	5	So know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you.
5145	5	8	6	8	6	Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him.
5146	5	8	7	8	7	For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills;
5147	5	8	8	8	8	a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
5148	5	8	9	8	9	a land where you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper.
5149	5	8	10	8	10	When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land that He has given you.
5150	5	8	11	8	11	Be careful not to forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes, which I am giving you this day.
5151	5	8	12	8	12	Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell,
5152	5	8	13	8	13	and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied,
5153	5	8	14	8	14	then your heart will become proud, and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
5154	5	8	15	8	15	He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint.
5155	5	8	16	8	16	He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper.
5156	5	8	17	8	17	You might say in your heart, “The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.”
5157	5	8	18	8	18	But remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
5158	5	8	19	8	19	If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish.
5159	5	8	20	8	20	Like the nations that the LORD has destroyed before you, so you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God.
5160	5	9	1	9	1	Hear, O Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified to the heavens.
5161	5	9	2	9	2	The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them and you have heard it said, “Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?”
5162	5	9	3	9	3	But understand that today the LORD your God goes across ahead of you as a consuming fire; He will destroy them and subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly, as the LORD has promised you.
5163	5	9	4	9	4	When the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say in your heart, “Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land.” Rather, the LORD is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness.
5164	5	9	5	9	5	It is not because of your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in to possess their land, but it is because of their wickedness that the LORD your God is driving out these nations before you, to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5165	5	9	6	9	6	Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.
5166	5	9	7	9	7	Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place, you have been rebelling against the LORD.
5167	5	9	8	9	8	At Horeb you provoked the LORD, and He was angry enough to destroy you.
5168	5	9	9	9	9	When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I ate no bread and drank no water.
5169	5	9	10	9	10	Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by the finger of God with the exact words that the LORD spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.
5170	5	9	11	9	11	And at the end of forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
5171	5	9	12	9	12	And the LORD said to me, “Get up and go down from here at once, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten image.”
5172	5	9	13	9	13	The LORD also said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.
5173	5	9	14	9	14	Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they.”
5174	5	9	15	9	15	So I went back down the mountain while it was blazing with fire, with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands.
5175	5	9	16	9	16	And I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
5176	5	9	17	9	17	So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, shattering them before your eyes.
5177	5	9	18	9	18	Then I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed in doing what was evil in the LORD’s sight and provoking Him to anger.
5178	5	9	19	9	19	For I was afraid of the anger and wrath that the LORD had directed against you, enough to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me this time as well.
5179	5	9	20	9	20	The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I also prayed for Aaron.
5180	5	9	21	9	21	And I took that sinful thing, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust, and I cast it into the stream that came down from the mountain.
5181	5	9	22	9	22	You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah.
5182	5	9	23	9	23	And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh-barnea, He said, “Go up and possess the land that I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him.
5183	5	9	24	9	24	You have been rebelling against the LORD since the day I came to know you.
5184	5	9	25	9	25	So I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said He would destroy you.
5185	5	9	26	9	26	And I prayed to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
5186	5	9	27	9	27	Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people and the wickedness of their sin.
5187	5	9	28	9	28	Otherwise, those in the land from which You brought us out will say, ‘Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’
5188	5	9	29	9	29	But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.”
5189	5	10	1	10	1	At that time the LORD said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
5190	5	10	2	10	2	And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you are to place them in the ark.”
5191	5	10	3	10	3	So I made an ark of acacia wood, chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
5192	5	10	4	10	4	And the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly. The LORD gave them to me,
5193	5	10	5	10	5	and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD had commanded me; and there they have remained.
5194	5	10	6	10	6	The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
5195	5	10	7	10	7	From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
5196	5	10	8	10	8	At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as they do to this day.
5197	5	10	9	10	9	That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance among his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God promised him.
5198	5	10	10	10	10	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, like the first time, and that time the LORD again listened to me and agreed not to destroy you.
5199	5	10	11	10	11	Then the LORD said to me, “Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.”
5200	5	10	12	10	12	And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His ways, to love Him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
5201	5	10	13	10	13	and to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD that I am giving you this day for your own good?
5202	5	10	14	10	14	Behold, to the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, and the earth and everything in it.
5203	5	10	15	10	15	Yet the LORD has set His affection on your fathers and loved them. And He has chosen you, their descendants after them, above all the peoples, even to this day.
5204	5	10	16	10	16	Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and stiffen your necks no more.
5205	5	10	17	10	17	For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no partiality and accepting no bribe.
5206	5	10	18	10	18	He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and He loves the foreigner, giving him food and clothing.
5207	5	10	19	10	19	So you also must love the foreigner, since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
5208	5	10	20	10	20	You are to fear the LORD your God and serve Him. Hold fast to Him and take your oaths in His name.
5209	5	10	21	10	21	He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome wonders that your eyes have seen.
5210	5	10	22	10	22	Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
5211	5	11	1	11	1	You shall therefore love the LORD your God and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.
5212	5	11	2	11	2	Know this day that it is not your children who have known and seen the discipline of the LORD your God: His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm;
5213	5	11	3	11	3	the signs and works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;
5214	5	11	4	11	4	what He did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you, and how He destroyed them completely, even to this day;
5215	5	11	5	11	5	what He did for you in the wilderness until you reached this place;
5216	5	11	6	11	6	and what He did in the midst of all the Israelites to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that belonged to them.
5217	5	11	7	11	7	For it is your own eyes that have seen every great work that the LORD has done.
5218	5	11	8	11	8	You shall therefore keep every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and possess the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
5219	5	11	9	11	9	and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5220	5	11	10	11	10	For the land that you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot, like a vegetable garden.
5221	5	11	11	11	11	But the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks in the rain from heaven.
5222	5	11	12	11	12	It is a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning to the end of the year.
5223	5	11	13	11	13	So if you carefully obey the commandments I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,
5224	5	11	14	11	14	then I will provide rain for your land in season, the autumn and spring rains, that you may gather your grain, new wine, and oil.
5225	5	11	15	11	15	And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied.
5226	5	11	16	11	16	But be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside to worship and bow down to other gods,
5227	5	11	17	11	17	or the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you. He will shut the heavens so that there will be no rain, nor will the land yield its produce, and you will soon perish from the good land that the LORD is giving you.
5228	5	11	18	11	18	Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
5229	5	11	19	11	19	Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
5230	5	11	20	11	20	Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates,
5231	5	11	21	11	21	so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your days and those of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers.
5232	5	11	22	11	22	For if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him—
5233	5	11	23	11	23	then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you.
5234	5	11	24	11	24	Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Western Sea.
5235	5	11	25	11	25	No man will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will put the fear and dread of you upon all the land, wherever you set foot, as He has promised you.
5236	5	11	26	11	26	See, today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse—
5237	5	11	27	11	27	a blessing if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I am giving you today,
5238	5	11	28	11	28	but a curse if you disobey the commandments of the LORD your God and turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.
5239	5	11	29	11	29	When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
5240	5	11	30	11	30	Are not these mountains across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the Oak of Moreh?
5241	5	11	31	11	31	For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you. When you take possession of it and settle in it,
5242	5	11	32	11	32	be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today.
5243	5	12	1	12	1	These are the statutes and ordinances you must be careful to follow all the days you live in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess.
5244	5	12	2	12	2	Destroy completely all the places where the nations you are dispossessing have served their gods—atop the high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree.
5245	5	12	3	12	3	Tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah poles, cut down the idols of their gods, and wipe out their names from every place.
5246	5	12	4	12	4	You shall not worship the LORD your God in this way.
5247	5	12	5	12	5	Instead, you must seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to establish as a dwelling for His Name, and there you must go.
5248	5	12	6	12	6	To that place you are to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and heave offerings, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, as well as the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
5249	5	12	7	12	7	There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your households shall eat and rejoice in all you do, because the LORD your God has blessed you.
5250	5	12	8	12	8	You are not to do as we are doing here today, where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes.
5251	5	12	9	12	9	For you have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that the LORD your God is giving you.
5252	5	12	10	12	10	When you cross the Jordan and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and He gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you live in security,
5253	5	12	11	12	11	then the LORD your God will choose a dwelling for His Name. And there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice offerings you vow to the LORD.
5254	5	12	12	12	12	And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
5255	5	12	13	12	13	Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see;
5256	5	12	14	12	14	you must offer them only in the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribal territories, and there you shall do all that I command you.
5257	5	12	15	12	15	But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you. Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it as they would a gazelle or deer,
5258	5	12	16	12	16	but you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
5259	5	12	17	12	17	Within your gates you must not eat the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, the firstborn of your herds or flocks, any of the offerings that you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
5260	5	12	18	12	18	Instead, you must eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates. Rejoice before the LORD your God in all you do,
5261	5	12	19	12	19	and be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
5262	5	12	20	12	20	When the LORD your God expands your territory as He has promised, and you crave meat and say, “I want to eat meat,” you may eat it whenever you want.
5263	5	12	21	12	21	If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put His Name is too far from you, then you may slaughter any of the herd or flock He has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want.
5264	5	12	22	12	22	Indeed, you may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or deer; both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.
5265	5	12	23	12	23	Only be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
5266	5	12	24	12	24	You must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
5267	5	12	25	12	25	Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
5268	5	12	26	12	26	But you are to take your holy things and your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD will choose.
5269	5	12	27	12	27	Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.
5270	5	12	28	12	28	Be careful to obey all these things I command you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
5271	5	12	29	12	29	When the LORD your God cuts off before you the nations you are entering to dispossess, and you drive them out and live in their land,
5272	5	12	30	12	30	be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, asking, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.”
5273	5	12	31	12	31	You must not worship the LORD your God in this way, because they practice for their gods every abomination which the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
5274	5	13	1	12	32	See that you do everything I command you; do not add to it or subtract from it.
5275	5	13	2	13	1	If a prophet or dreamer of dreams arises among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you,
5276	5	13	3	13	2	and if the sign or wonder he has spoken to you comes about, but he says, “Let us follow other gods (which you have not known) and let us worship them,”
5277	5	13	4	13	3	you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
5278	5	13	5	13	4	You are to follow the LORD your God and fear Him. Keep His commandments and listen to His voice; serve Him and hold fast to Him.
5279	5	13	6	13	5	Such a prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he has advocated rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way in which the LORD your God has commanded you to walk. So you must purge the evil from among you.
5280	5	13	7	13	6	If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (which neither you nor your fathers have known,
5281	5	13	8	13	7	the gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the earth to the other),
5282	5	13	9	13	8	you must not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity, and do not spare him or shield him.
5283	5	13	10	13	9	Instead, you must surely kill him. Your hand must be the first against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people.
5284	5	13	11	13	10	Stone him to death for trying to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
5285	5	13	12	13	11	Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you.
5286	5	13	13	13	12	If, regarding one of the cities the LORD your God is giving you to inhabit, you hear it said
5287	5	13	14	13	13	that wicked men have arisen from among you and have led the people of their city astray, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods” (which you have not known),
5288	5	13	15	13	14	then you must inquire, investigate, and interrogate thoroughly. And if it is established with certainty that this abomination has been committed among you,
5289	5	13	16	13	15	you must surely strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword. Devote to destruction all its people and livestock.
5290	5	13	17	13	16	And you are to gather all its plunder in the middle of the public square, and completely burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. The city must remain a mound of ruins forever, never to be rebuilt.
5291	5	13	18	13	17	Nothing devoted to destruction shall cling to your hands, so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger, grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers,
5292	5	13	19	13	18	because you obey the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments I am giving you today and doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
5293	5	14	1	14	1	You are sons of the LORD your God; do not cut yourselves or shave your forehead on behalf of the dead,
5294	5	14	2	14	2	for you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. The LORD has chosen you to be His prized possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.
5295	5	14	3	14	3	You must not eat any detestable thing.
5296	5	14	4	14	4	These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the sheep, the goat,
5297	5	14	5	14	5	the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
5298	5	14	6	14	6	You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud.
5299	5	14	7	14	7	But of those that chew the cud or have a completely divided hoof, you are not to eat the following: the camel, the rabbit, or the rock badger. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a divided hoof. They are unclean for you,
5300	5	14	8	14	8	as well as the pig; though it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. It is unclean for you. You must not eat its meat or touch its carcass.
5301	5	14	9	14	9	Of all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat anything with fins and scales,
5302	5	14	10	14	10	but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales; it is unclean for you.
5303	5	14	11	14	11	You may eat any clean bird,
5304	5	14	12	14	12	but these you may not eat: the eagle, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
5305	5	14	13	14	13	the red kite, the falcon, any kind of kite,
5306	5	14	14	14	14	any kind of raven,
5307	5	14	15	14	15	the ostrich, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
5308	5	14	16	14	16	the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
5309	5	14	17	14	17	the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
5310	5	14	18	14	18	the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, or the bat.
5311	5	14	19	14	19	All flying insects that swarm are unclean for you; they may not be eaten.
5312	5	14	20	14	20	But you may eat any clean bird.
5313	5	14	21	14	21	You are not to eat any carcass; you may give it to the foreigner residing within your gates, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. For you are a holy people belonging to the LORD your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
5314	5	14	22	14	22	You must be sure to set aside a tenth of all the produce brought forth each year from your fields.
5315	5	14	23	14	23	And you are to eat a tenth of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks, in the presence of the LORD your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.
5316	5	14	24	14	24	But if the distance is too great for you to carry that with which the LORD your God has blessed you, because the place where the LORD your God will choose to put His Name is too far away,
5317	5	14	25	14	25	then exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place the LORD your God will choose.
5318	5	14	26	14	26	Then you may spend the money on anything you desire: cattle, sheep, wine, strong drink, or anything you wish. You are to feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice with your household.
5319	5	14	27	14	27	And do not neglect the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you.
5320	5	14	28	14	28	At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of all your produce for that year and lay it up within your gates.
5321	5	14	29	14	29	Then the Levite (because he has no portion or inheritance among you), the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow within your gates may come and eat and be satisfied. And the LORD your God will bless you in all the work of your hands.
5322	5	15	1	15	1	At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
5323	5	15	2	15	2	This is the manner of remission: Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD’s time of release has been proclaimed.
5324	5	15	3	15	3	You may collect something from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you.
5325	5	15	4	15	4	There will be no poor among you, however, because the LORD will surely bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance,
5326	5	15	5	15	5	if only you obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commandments I am giving you today.
5327	5	15	6	15	6	When the LORD your God blesses you as He has promised, you will lend to many nations but borrow from none; you will rule over many nations but be ruled by none.
5328	5	15	7	15	7	If there is a poor man among your brothers within any of the gates in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, then you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand from your poor brother.
5329	5	15	8	15	8	Instead, you are to open your hand to him and freely loan him whatever he needs.
5330	5	15	9	15	9	Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought in your heart: “The seventh year, the year of release, is near,” so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly and give him nothing. He will cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
5331	5	15	10	15	10	Give generously to him, and do not let your heart be grieved when you do so. And because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything to which you put your hand.
5332	5	15	11	15	11	For there will never cease to be poor in the land; that is why I am commanding you to open wide your hand to your brother and to the poor and needy in your land.
5333	5	15	12	15	12	If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, in the seventh year you must set him free.
5334	5	15	13	15	13	And when you release him, do not send him away empty-handed.
5335	5	15	14	15	14	You are to furnish him liberally from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. You shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.
5336	5	15	15	15	15	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; that is why I am giving you this command today.
5337	5	15	16	15	16	But if your servant says to you, ‘I do not want to leave you,’ because he loves you and your household and is well off with you,
5338	5	15	17	15	17	then take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he will become your servant for life. And treat your maidservant the same way.
5339	5	15	18	15	18	Do not regard it as a hardship to set your servant free, because his six years of service were worth twice the wages of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in all you do.
5340	5	15	19	15	19	You must set apart to the LORD your God every firstborn male produced by your herds and flocks. You are not to put the firstborn of your oxen to work, nor are you to shear the firstborn of your flock.
5341	5	15	20	15	20	Each year you and your household are to eat it before the LORD your God in the place the LORD will choose.
5342	5	15	21	15	21	But if an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
5343	5	15	22	15	22	Eat it within your gates; both the ceremonially unclean and clean may eat it as they would a gazelle or a deer.
5344	5	15	23	15	23	But you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
5345	5	16	1	16	1	Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, because in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
5346	5	16	2	16	2	You are to offer to the LORD your God the Passover sacrifice from the herd or flock in the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for His Name.
5347	5	16	3	16	3	You must not eat leavened bread with it; for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left the land of Egypt in haste—so that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the land of Egypt.
5348	5	16	4	16	4	No leaven is to be found in all your land for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice in the evening of the first day shall remain until morning.
5349	5	16	5	16	5	You are not to sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you.
5350	5	16	6	16	6	You must only offer the Passover sacrifice at the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name. Do this in the evening as the sun sets, at the same time you departed from Egypt.
5351	5	16	7	16	7	And you shall roast and eat it in the place the LORD your God will choose, and in the morning you shall return to your tents.
5352	5	16	8	16	8	For six days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day you shall hold a solemn assembly to the LORD your God, and you must not do any work.
5353	5	16	9	16	9	You are to count off seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain.
5354	5	16	10	16	10	And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill offering that you give in proportion to how the LORD your God has blessed you,
5355	5	16	11	16	11	and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows among you.
5356	5	16	12	16	12	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and carefully follow these statutes.
5357	5	16	13	16	13	You are to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.
5358	5	16	14	16	14	And you shall rejoice in your feast—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows among you.
5359	5	16	15	16	15	For seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place He will choose, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that your joy will be complete.
5360	5	16	16	16	16	Three times a year all your men are to appear before the LORD your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed.
5361	5	16	17	16	17	Everyone must appear with a gift as he is able, according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you.
5362	5	16	18	16	18	You are to appoint judges and officials for your tribes in every town that the LORD your God is giving you. They are to judge the people with righteous judgment.
5363	5	16	19	16	19	Do not deny justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
5364	5	16	20	16	20	Pursue justice, and justice alone, so that you may live, and you may possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
5365	5	16	21	16	21	Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole next to the altar you will build for the LORD your God,
5366	5	16	22	16	22	and do not set up for yourselves a sacred pillar, which the LORD your God hates.
5367	5	17	1	17	1	You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep with any defect or serious flaw, for that is detestable to the LORD your God.
5368	5	17	2	17	2	If a man or woman among you in one of the towns that the LORD your God gives you is found doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God by transgressing His covenant
5369	5	17	3	17	3	and going to worship other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven—which I have forbidden—
5370	5	17	4	17	4	and if it is reported and you hear about it, you must investigate it thoroughly. If the report is true and such an abomination has happened in Israel,
5371	5	17	5	17	5	you must bring out to your gates the man or woman who has done this evil thing, and you must stone that person to death.
5372	5	17	6	17	6	On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death, but he shall not be executed on the testimony of a lone witness.
5373	5	17	7	17	7	The hands of the witnesses shall be the first in putting him to death, and after that, the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.
5374	5	17	8	17	8	If a case is too difficult for you to judge, whether the controversy within your gates is regarding bloodshed, lawsuits, or assaults, you must go up to the place the LORD your God will choose.
5375	5	17	9	17	9	You are to go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who presides at that time. Inquire of them, and they will give you a verdict in the case.
5376	5	17	10	17	10	You must abide by the verdict they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do everything they instruct you,
5377	5	17	11	17	11	according to the terms of law they give and the verdict they proclaim. Do not turn aside to the right or to the left from the decision they declare to you.
5378	5	17	12	17	12	But the man who acts presumptuously, refusing to listen either to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, or to the judge, must be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
5379	5	17	13	17	13	Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will no longer behave arrogantly.
5380	5	17	14	17	14	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, “Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,”
5381	5	17	15	17	15	you are to appoint over yourselves the king whom the LORD your God shall choose. Appoint a king from among your brothers; you are not to set over yourselves a foreigner who is not one of your brothers.
5382	5	17	16	17	16	But the king must not acquire many horses for himself or send the people back to Egypt to acquire more horses, for the LORD has said, ‘You are never to go back that way again.’
5383	5	17	17	17	17	He must not take many wives for himself, lest his heart go astray. He must not accumulate for himself large amounts of silver and gold.
5384	5	17	18	17	18	When he is seated on his royal throne, he must write for himself a copy of this instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
5385	5	17	19	17	19	It is to remain with him, and he is to read from it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the LORD his God by carefully observing all the words of this instruction and these statutes.
5386	5	17	20	17	20	Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen, and he will not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left, in order that he and his sons may reign many years over his kingdom in Israel.
5387	5	18	1	18	1	The Levitical priests—indeed the whole tribe of Levi—shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They are to eat the offerings made by fire to the LORD; that is their inheritance.
5388	5	18	2	18	2	Although they have no inheritance among their brothers, the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them.
5389	5	18	3	18	3	This shall be the priests’ share from the people who offer a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep: the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.
5390	5	18	4	18	4	You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first wool sheared from your flock.
5391	5	18	5	18	5	For the LORD your God has chosen Levi and his sons out of all your tribes to stand and minister in His name for all time.
5392	5	18	6	18	6	Now if a Levite moves from any town of residence throughout Israel and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose,
5393	5	18	7	18	7	then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD.
5394	5	18	8	18	8	They shall eat equal portions, even though he has received money from the sale of his father’s estate.
5395	5	18	9	18	9	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
5396	5	18	10	18	10	Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, practices divination or conjury, interprets omens, practices sorcery,
5397	5	18	11	18	11	casts spells, consults a medium or spiritist, or inquires of the dead.
5398	5	18	12	18	12	For whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD. And because of these detestable things, the LORD your God is driving out the nations before you.
5399	5	18	13	18	13	You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
5400	5	18	14	18	14	Though these nations, which you will dispossess, listen to conjurers and diviners, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so.
5401	5	18	15	18	15	The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to him.
5402	5	18	16	18	16	This is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not die!”
5403	5	18	17	18	17	Then the LORD said to me, “They have spoken well.
5404	5	18	18	18	18	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
5405	5	18	19	18	19	And I will hold accountable anyone who does not listen to My words that that prophet speaks in My name.
5406	5	18	20	18	20	But if any prophet dares to speak a message in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or to speak in the name of other gods, that prophet must be put to death.”
5407	5	18	21	18	21	You may ask in your heart, “How can we recognize a message that the LORD has not spoken?”
5408	5	18	22	18	22	When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the message does not come to pass or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.
5409	5	19	1	19	1	When the LORD your God has cut off the nations whose land He is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their cities and houses,
5410	5	19	2	19	2	then you are to set apart for yourselves three cities within the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
5411	5	19	3	19	3	You are to build roads for yourselves and divide into three regions the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that any manslayer can flee to these cities.
5412	5	19	4	19	4	Now this is the situation regarding the manslayer who flees to one of these cities to save his life, having killed his neighbor accidentally, without intending to harm him:
5413	5	19	5	19	5	If he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber and swings his axe to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes and kills his neighbor, he may flee to one of these cities to save his life.
5414	5	19	6	19	6	Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in a rage, overtake him if the distance is great, and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die, since he did not intend any harm.
5415	5	19	7	19	7	This is why I am commanding you to set apart for yourselves three cities.
5416	5	19	8	19	8	And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land He promised them,
5417	5	19	9	19	9	and if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you today, loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at all times, then you are to add three more cities to these three.
5418	5	19	10	19	10	Thus innocent blood will not be shed in the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
5419	5	19	11	19	11	If, however, a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait, attacks him and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities,
5420	5	19	12	19	12	the elders of his city must send for him, bring him back, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die.
5421	5	19	13	19	13	You must show him no pity. You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, that it may go well with you.
5422	5	19	14	19	14	You must not move your neighbor’s boundary marker, which was set up by your ancestors to mark the inheritance you shall receive in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
5423	5	19	15	19	15	A lone witness is not sufficient to establish any wrongdoing or sin against a man, regardless of what offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
5424	5	19	16	19	16	If a false witness testifies against someone, accusing him of a crime,
5425	5	19	17	19	17	both parties to the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD, before the priests and judges who are in office at that time.
5426	5	19	18	19	18	The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is proven to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother,
5427	5	19	19	19	19	you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from among you.
5428	5	19	20	19	20	Then the rest of the people will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything so evil among you.
5429	5	19	21	19	21	You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.
5430	5	20	1	20	1	When you go out to war against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you.
5431	5	20	2	20	2	When you are about to go into battle, the priest is to come forward and address the army,
5432	5	20	3	20	3	saying to them, “Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be alarmed or terrified because of them.
5433	5	20	4	20	4	For the LORD your God is He who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.”
5434	5	20	5	20	5	Furthermore, the officers are to address the army, saying, “Has any man built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man dedicate it.
5435	5	20	6	20	6	Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy its fruit? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit.
5436	5	20	7	20	7	Has any man become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man marry her.”
5437	5	20	8	20	8	Then the officers shall speak further to the army, saying, “Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him return home, so that the hearts of his brothers will not melt like his own.”
5438	5	20	9	20	9	When the officers have finished addressing the army, they are to appoint commanders to lead it.
5439	5	20	10	20	10	When you approach a city to fight against it, you are to make an offer of peace.
5440	5	20	11	20	11	If they accept your offer of peace and open their gates, all the people there will become forced laborers to serve you.
5441	5	20	12	20	12	But if they refuse to make peace with you and wage war against you, lay siege to that city.
5442	5	20	13	20	13	When the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you must strike down every male with the sword.
5443	5	20	14	20	14	But the women, children, livestock, and whatever else is in the city—all its spoil—you may take as plunder, and you shall use the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you.
5444	5	20	15	20	15	This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
5445	5	20	16	20	16	However, in the cities of the nations that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not leave alive anything that breathes.
5446	5	20	17	20	17	For you must devote them to complete destruction—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you,
5447	5	20	18	20	18	so that they cannot teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods, and so cause you to sin against the LORD your God.
5448	5	20	19	20	19	When you lay siege to a city for an extended time while fighting against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. You must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field human, that you should besiege them?
5449	5	20	20	20	20	But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce fruit. Use them to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls.
5450	5	21	1	21	1	If one is found slain, lying in a field in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,
5451	5	21	2	21	2	your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the neighboring cities.
5452	5	21	3	21	3	Then the elders of the city nearest the victim shall take a heifer that has never been yoked or used for work,
5453	5	21	4	21	4	bring the heifer to a valley with running water that has not been plowed or sown, and break its neck there by the stream.
5454	5	21	5	21	5	And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault.
5455	5	21	6	21	6	Then all the elders of the city nearest the victim shall wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken,
5456	5	21	7	21	7	and they shall declare, “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.
5457	5	21	8	21	8	Accept this atonement, O LORD, for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.” And the bloodshed will be atoned for.
5458	5	21	9	21	9	So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
5459	5	21	10	21	10	When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take them captive,
5460	5	21	11	21	11	if you see a beautiful woman among them, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife,
5461	5	21	12	21	12	then you shall bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,
5462	5	21	13	21	13	and put aside the clothing of her captivity. After she has lived in your house a full month and mourned her father and mother, you may have relations with her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
5463	5	21	14	21	14	And if you are not pleased with her, you are to let her go wherever she wishes. But you must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
5464	5	21	15	21	15	If a man has two wives, one beloved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, but the unloved wife has the firstborn son,
5465	5	21	16	21	16	when that man assigns his inheritance to his sons he must not appoint the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over the son of the unloved wife.
5466	5	21	17	21	17	Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of his unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of all that he has. For that son is the firstfruits of his father’s strength; the right of the firstborn belongs to him.
5467	5	21	18	21	18	If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them when disciplined,
5468	5	21	19	21	19	his father and mother are to lay hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown,
5469	5	21	20	21	20	and say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”
5470	5	21	21	21	21	Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid.
5471	5	21	22	21	22	If a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is executed, and you hang his body on a tree,
5472	5	21	23	21	23	you must not leave the body on the tree overnight, but you must be sure to bury him that day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5473	5	22	1	22	1	If you see your brother’s ox or sheep straying, you must not ignore it; be sure to return it to your brother.
5474	5	22	2	22	2	If your brother does not live near you, or if you do not know who he is, you are to take the animal home to remain with you until your brother comes seeking it; then you can return it to him.
5475	5	22	3	22	3	And you shall do the same for his donkey, his cloak, or anything your brother has lost and you have found. You must not ignore it.
5476	5	22	4	22	4	If you see your brother’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, you must not ignore it; you must help him lift it up.
5477	5	22	5	22	5	A woman must not wear men’s clothing, and a man must not wear women’s clothing, for whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD your God.
5478	5	22	6	22	6	If you come across a bird’s nest with chicks or eggs, either in a tree or on the ground along the road, and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs, you must not take the mother along with the young.
5479	5	22	7	22	7	You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.
5480	5	22	8	22	8	If you build a new house, you are to construct a railing around your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it.
5481	5	22	9	22	9	Do not plant your vineyard with two types of seed; if you do, the entire harvest will be defiled—both the crop you plant and the fruit of your vineyard.
5482	5	22	10	22	10	Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
5483	5	22	11	22	11	Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
5484	5	22	12	22	12	You are to make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
5485	5	22	13	22	13	Suppose a man marries a woman, has relations with her, and comes to hate her,
5486	5	22	14	22	14	and then accuses her of shameful conduct and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman and had relations with her, but I discovered she was not a virgin.”
5487	5	22	15	22	15	Then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate
5488	5	22	16	22	16	and say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he has come to hate her.
5489	5	22	17	22	17	And now he has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, ‘I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin.’ But here is the proof of her virginity.” And they shall spread out the cloth before the city elders.
5490	5	22	18	22	18	Then the elders of that city shall take the man and punish him.
5491	5	22	19	22	19	They are also to fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given a virgin of Israel a bad name. And she shall remain his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.
5492	5	22	20	22	20	If, however, this accusation is true, and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found,
5493	5	22	21	22	21	she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house, and there the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.
5494	5	22	22	22	22	If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
5495	5	22	23	22	23	If there is a virgin pledged in marriage to a man, and another man encounters her in the city and sleeps with her,
5496	5	22	24	22	24	you must take both of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
5497	5	22	25	22	25	But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country, and he overpowers her and lies with her, only the man who has done this must die.
5498	5	22	26	22	26	Do nothing to the young woman, because she has committed no sin worthy of death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him.
5499	5	22	27	22	27	When he found her in the field, the betrothed woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.
5500	5	22	28	22	28	If a man encounters a virgin who is not pledged in marriage, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,
5501	5	22	29	22	29	the man who lay with her must pay the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she must become his wife because he has violated her. He must not divorce her as long as he lives.
5502	5	23	1	22	30	A man is not to marry his father’s wife, so that he will not dishonor his father’s marriage bed.
5503	5	23	2	23	1	No man with crushed or severed genitals may enter the assembly of the LORD.
5504	5	23	3	23	2	No one of illegitimate birth may enter the assembly of the LORD, nor may any of his descendants, even to the tenth generation.
5505	5	23	4	23	3	No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even to the tenth generation.
5506	5	23	5	23	4	For they did not meet you with food and water on your way out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you.
5507	5	23	6	23	5	Yet the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam, and the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you.
5508	5	23	7	23	6	You are not to seek peace or prosperity from them as long as you live.
5509	5	23	8	23	7	Do not despise an Edomite, for he is your brother. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.
5510	5	23	9	23	8	The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD.
5511	5	23	10	23	9	When you are encamped against your enemies, then you shall keep yourself from every wicked thing.
5512	5	23	11	23	10	If any man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp and stay outside.
5513	5	23	12	23	11	When evening approaches, he must wash with water, and when the sun sets he may return to the camp.
5514	5	23	13	23	12	You must have a place outside the camp to go and relieve yourself.
5515	5	23	14	23	13	And you must have a digging tool in your equipment so that when you relieve yourself you can dig a hole and cover up your excrement.
5516	5	23	15	23	14	For the LORD your God walks throughout your camp to protect you and deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, lest He see anything unclean among you and turn away from you.
5517	5	23	16	23	15	Do not return a slave to his master if he has taken refuge with you.
5518	5	23	17	23	16	Let him live among you wherever he chooses, in the town of his pleasing. Do not oppress him.
5519	5	23	18	23	17	No daughter or son of Israel is to be a cult prostitute.
5520	5	23	19	23	18	You must not bring the wages of a prostitute, whether female or male, into the house of the LORD your God to fulfill any vow, because both are detestable to the LORD your God.
5521	5	23	20	23	19	Do not charge your brother interest on money, food, or any other type of loan.
5522	5	23	21	23	20	You may charge a foreigner interest, but not your brother, so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything to which you put your hand in the land that you are entering to possess.
5523	5	23	22	23	21	If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be slow to keep it, because He will surely require it of you, and you will be guilty of sin.
5524	5	23	23	23	22	But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty of sin.
5525	5	23	24	23	23	Be careful to follow through on what comes from your lips, because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth.
5526	5	23	25	23	24	When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, but you must not put any in your basket.
5527	5	23	26	23	25	When you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand, but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain.
5528	5	24	1	24	1	If a man marries a woman, but she becomes displeasing to him because he finds some indecency in her, he may write her a certificate of divorce, hand it to her, and send her away from his house.
5529	5	24	2	24	2	If, after leaving his house, she goes and becomes another man’s wife,
5530	5	24	3	24	3	and the second man hates her, writes her a certificate of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house, or if he dies,
5531	5	24	4	24	4	then the husband who divorced her first may not marry her again after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination to the LORD. You must not bring sin upon the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
5532	5	24	5	24	5	If a man is newly married, he must not be sent to war or be pressed into any duty. For one year he is free to stay at home and bring joy to the wife he has married.
5533	5	24	6	24	6	Do not take a pair of millstones or even an upper millstone as security for a debt, because that would be taking one’s livelihood as security.
5534	5	24	7	24	7	If a man is caught kidnapping one of his Israelite brothers, whether he treats him as a slave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
5535	5	24	8	24	8	In cases of infectious skin diseases, be careful to diligently follow everything the Levitical priests instruct you. Be careful to do as I have commanded them.
5536	5	24	9	24	9	Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the journey after you had left Egypt.
5537	5	24	10	24	10	When you lend anything to your neighbor, do not enter his house to collect security.
5538	5	24	11	24	11	You are to stand outside while the man to whom you are lending brings the security out to you.
5539	5	24	12	24	12	If he is a poor man, you must not go to sleep with the security in your possession;
5540	5	24	13	24	13	be sure to return it to him by sunset, so that he may sleep in his own cloak and bless you, and this will be credited to you as righteousness before the LORD your God.
5541	5	24	14	24	14	Do not oppress a hired hand who is poor and needy, whether he is a brother or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.
5542	5	24	15	24	15	You are to pay his wages each day before sunset, because he is poor and depends on them. Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
5543	5	24	16	24	16	Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.
5544	5	24	17	24	17	Do not deny justice to the foreigner or the fatherless, and do not take a widow’s cloak as security.
5545	5	24	18	24	18	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from that place. Therefore I am commanding you to do this.
5546	5	24	19	24	19	If you are harvesting in your field and forget a sheaf there, do not go back to get it. It is to be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
5547	5	24	20	24	20	When you beat the olives from your trees, you must not go over the branches again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
5548	5	24	21	24	21	When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you must not go over the vines again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
5549	5	24	22	24	22	Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. Therefore I am commanding you to do this.
5550	5	25	1	25	1	If there is a dispute between men, they are to go to court to be judged, so that the innocent may be acquitted and the guilty condemned.
5551	5	25	2	25	2	If the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall have him lie down and be flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime warrants.
5552	5	25	3	25	3	He may receive no more than forty lashes, lest your brother be beaten any more than that and be degraded in your sight.
5553	5	25	4	25	4	Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
5554	5	25	5	25	5	When brothers dwell together and one of them dies without a son, the widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband’s brother is to take her as his wife and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law for her.
5555	5	25	6	25	6	The first son she bears will carry on the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
5556	5	25	7	25	7	But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, she is to go to the elders at the city gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law for me.”
5557	5	25	8	25	8	Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak with him. If he persists and says, “I do not want to marry her,”
5558	5	25	9	25	9	his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal, spit in his face, and declare, “This is what is done to the man who will not maintain his brother’s line.”
5559	5	25	10	25	10	And his family name in Israel will be called “The House of the Unsandaled.”
5560	5	25	11	25	11	If two men are fighting, and the wife of one steps in to rescue her husband from the one striking him, and she reaches out her hand and grabs his genitals,
5561	5	25	12	25	12	you are to cut off her hand. You must show her no pity.
5562	5	25	13	25	13	You shall not have two differing weights in your bag, one heavy and one light.
5563	5	25	14	25	14	You shall not have two differing measures in your house, one large and one small.
5564	5	25	15	25	15	You must maintain accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
5565	5	25	16	25	16	For everyone who behaves dishonestly in regard to these things is detestable to the LORD your God.
5566	5	25	17	25	17	Remember what the Amalekites did to you along your way from Egypt,
5567	5	25	18	25	18	how they met you on your journey when you were tired and weary, and they attacked all your stragglers; they had no fear of God.
5568	5	25	19	25	19	When the LORD your God gives you rest from the enemies around you in the land that He is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you are to blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!
5569	5	26	1	26	1	When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and settle in it,
5570	5	26	2	26	2	you are to take some of the firstfruits of all your produce from the soil of the land that the LORD your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name,
5571	5	26	3	26	3	to the priest who is serving at that time, and say to him, “I declare today to the LORD your God that I have entered the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.”
5572	5	26	4	26	4	Then the priest shall take the basket from your hands and place it before the altar of the LORD your God,
5573	5	26	5	26	5	and you are to declare before the LORD your God, “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt few in number and lived there and became a great nation, mighty and numerous.
5574	5	26	6	26	6	But the Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us, putting us to hard labor.
5575	5	26	7	26	7	So we called out to the LORD, the God of our fathers; and the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, toil, and oppression.
5576	5	26	8	26	8	Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, signs, and wonders.
5577	5	26	9	26	9	And He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5578	5	26	10	26	10	And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land that You, O LORD, have given me.” Then you are to place the basket before the LORD your God and bow down before Him.
5579	5	26	11	26	11	So you shall rejoice—you, the Levite, and the foreigner dwelling among you—in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household.
5580	5	26	12	26	12	When you have finished laying aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you are to give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat and be filled within your gates.
5581	5	26	13	26	13	Then you shall declare in the presence of the LORD your God, “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all the commandments You have given me. I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments.
5582	5	26	14	26	14	I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while in mourning, or removed any of it while unclean, or offered any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God; I have done everything You commanded me.
5583	5	26	15	26	15	Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land You have given us as You swore to our fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey.”
5584	5	26	16	26	16	The LORD your God commands you this day to follow these statutes and ordinances. You must be careful to follow them with all your heart and with all your soul.
5585	5	26	17	26	17	Today you have proclaimed that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in His ways, keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances, and listen to His voice.
5586	5	26	18	26	18	And today the LORD has proclaimed that you are His people and treasured possession as He promised, that you are to keep all His commandments,
5587	5	26	19	26	19	that He will set you high in praise and name and honor above all the nations He has made, and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God, as He has promised.
5588	5	27	1	27	1	Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: “Keep all the commandments I am giving you today.
5589	5	27	2	27	2	And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster.
5590	5	27	3	27	3	Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
5591	5	27	4	27	4	And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster.
5592	5	27	5	27	5	Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them.
5593	5	27	6	27	6	You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God.
5594	5	27	7	27	7	There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.
5595	5	27	8	27	8	And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.”
5596	5	27	9	27	9	Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
5597	5	27	10	27	10	You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.”
5598	5	27	11	27	11	On that day Moses commanded the people:
5599	5	27	12	27	12	“When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
5600	5	27	13	27	13	And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to deliver the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
5601	5	27	14	27	14	Then the Levites shall proclaim in a loud voice to every Israelite:
5602	5	27	15	27	15	‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved idol or molten image—an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of a craftsman—and sets it up in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5603	5	27	16	27	16	‘Cursed is he who dishonors his father or mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5604	5	27	17	27	17	‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary stone.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5605	5	27	18	27	18	‘Cursed is he who lets a blind man wander in the road.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5606	5	27	19	27	19	‘Cursed is he who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5607	5	27	20	27	20	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his father’s wife, for he has violated his father’s marriage bed.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5608	5	27	21	27	21	‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5609	5	27	22	27	22	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5610	5	27	23	27	23	‘Cursed is he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5611	5	27	24	27	24	‘Cursed is he who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5612	5	27	25	27	25	‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’
5613	5	27	26	27	26	‘Cursed is he who does not put the words of this law into practice.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen!’”
5614	5	28	1	28	1	“Now if you faithfully obey the voice of the LORD your God and are careful to follow all His commandments I am giving you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.
5615	5	28	2	28	2	All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you, if you will obey the voice of the LORD your God:
5616	5	28	3	28	3	You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.
5617	5	28	4	28	4	The fruit of your womb will be blessed, as well as the produce of your land and the offspring of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
5618	5	28	5	28	5	Your basket and kneading bowl will be blessed.
5619	5	28	6	28	6	You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
5620	5	28	7	28	7	The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you. They will march out against you in one direction but flee from you in seven.
5621	5	28	8	28	8	The LORD will decree a blessing on your barns and on everything to which you put your hand; the LORD your God will bless you in the land He is giving you.
5622	5	28	9	28	9	The LORD will establish you as His holy people, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk in His ways.
5623	5	28	10	28	10	Then all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will stand in awe of you.
5624	5	28	11	28	11	The LORD will make you prosper abundantly—in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land—in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.
5625	5	28	12	28	12	The LORD will open the heavens, His abundant storehouse, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations, but borrow from none.
5626	5	28	13	28	13	The LORD will make you the head and not the tail; you will only move upward and never downward, if you hear and carefully follow the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am giving you today.
5627	5	28	14	28	14	Do not turn aside to the right or to the left from any of the words I command you today, and do not go after other gods to serve them.
5628	5	28	15	28	15	If, however, you do not obey the LORD your God by carefully following all His commandments and statutes I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:
5629	5	28	16	28	16	You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.
5630	5	28	17	28	17	Your basket and kneading bowl will be cursed.
5631	5	28	18	28	18	The fruit of your womb will be cursed, as well as the produce of your land, the calves of your herds, and the lambs of your flocks.
5632	5	28	19	28	19	You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
5633	5	28	20	28	20	The LORD will send curses upon you, confusion and reproof in all to which you put your hand, until you are destroyed and quickly perish because of the wickedness you have committed in forsaking Him.
5634	5	28	21	28	21	The LORD will make the plague cling to you until He has exterminated you from the land that you are entering to possess.
5635	5	28	22	28	22	The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew; these will pursue you until you perish.
5636	5	28	23	28	23	The sky over your head will be bronze, and the earth beneath you iron.
5637	5	28	24	28	24	The LORD will turn the rain of your land into dust and powder; it will descend on you from the sky until you are destroyed.
5638	5	28	25	28	25	The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will march out against them in one direction but flee from them in seven. You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
5639	5	28	26	28	26	Your corpses will be food for all the birds of the air and beasts of the earth, with no one to scare them away.
5640	5	28	27	28	27	The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors and scabs and itch from which you cannot be cured.
5641	5	28	28	28	28	The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind,
5642	5	28	29	28	29	and at noon you will grope about like a blind man in the darkness. You will not prosper in your ways. Day after day you will be oppressed and plundered, with no one to save you.
5643	5	28	30	28	30	You will be pledged in marriage to a woman, but another man will violate her. You will build a house but will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard but will not enjoy its fruit.
5644	5	28	31	28	31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be taken away and not returned to you. Your flock will be given to your enemies, and no one will save you.
5645	5	28	32	28	32	Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, while your eyes grow weary looking for them day after day, with no power in your hand.
5646	5	28	33	28	33	A people you do not know will eat the produce of your land and of all your toil. All your days you will be oppressed and crushed.
5647	5	28	34	28	34	You will be driven mad by the sights you see.
5648	5	28	35	28	35	The LORD will afflict you with painful, incurable boils on your knees and thighs, from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
5649	5	28	36	28	36	The LORD will bring you and the king you appoint to a nation neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.
5650	5	28	37	28	37	You will become an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule among all the nations to which the LORD will drive you.
5651	5	28	38	28	38	You will sow much seed in the field but harvest little, because the locusts will consume it.
5652	5	28	39	28	39	You will plant and cultivate vineyards, but will neither drink the wine nor gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.
5653	5	28	40	28	40	You will have olive trees throughout your territory but will never anoint yourself with oil, because the olives will drop off.
5654	5	28	41	28	41	You will father sons and daughters, but they will not remain yours, because they will go into captivity.
5655	5	28	42	28	42	Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land.
5656	5	28	43	28	43	The foreigner living among you will rise higher and higher above you, while you sink down lower and lower.
5657	5	28	44	28	44	He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
5658	5	28	45	28	45	All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, since you did not obey the LORD your God and keep the commandments and statutes He gave you.
5659	5	28	46	28	46	These curses will be a sign and a wonder upon you and your descendants forever.
5660	5	28	47	28	47	Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and gladness of heart in all your abundance,
5661	5	28	48	28	48	you will serve your enemies the LORD will send against you in famine, thirst, nakedness, and destitution. He will place an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.
5662	5	28	49	28	49	The LORD will bring a nation from afar, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down upon you like an eagle—a nation whose language you will not understand,
5663	5	28	50	28	50	a ruthless nation with no respect for the old and no pity for the young.
5664	5	28	51	28	51	They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks, until they have caused you to perish.
5665	5	28	52	28	52	They will besiege all the cities throughout your land, until the high and fortified walls in which you trust have fallen. They will besiege all your cities throughout the land that the LORD your God has given you.
5666	5	28	53	28	53	Then you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you.
5667	5	28	54	28	54	The most gentle and refined man among you will begrudge his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children who have survived,
5668	5	28	55	28	55	refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children he will eat because he has nothing left in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within all your gates.
5669	5	28	56	28	56	The most gentle and refined woman among you, so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge the husband she embraces and her son and daughter
5670	5	28	57	28	57	the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within your gates.
5671	5	28	58	28	58	If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name—the LORD your God—
5672	5	28	59	28	59	He will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses.
5673	5	28	60	28	60	He will afflict you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt, and they will cling to you.
5674	5	28	61	28	61	The LORD will also bring upon you every sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.
5675	5	28	62	28	62	You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
5676	5	28	63	28	63	Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and multiply, so also it will please Him to annihilate you and destroy you. And you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
5677	5	28	64	28	64	Then the LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
5678	5	28	65	28	65	Among those nations you will find no repose, not even a resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul.
5679	5	28	66	28	66	So your life will hang in doubt before you, and you will be afraid night and day, never certain of survival.
5680	5	28	67	28	67	In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’—because of the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see.
5681	5	28	68	28	68	The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships by a route that I said you should never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.”
5682	5	28	69	29	1	These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb.
5683	5	29	1	29	2	Moses summoned all Israel and proclaimed to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land.
5684	5	29	2	29	3	You saw with your own eyes the great trials, and those miraculous signs and wonders.
5685	5	29	3	29	4	Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear.
5686	5	29	4	29	5	For forty years I led you in the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out.
5687	5	29	5	29	6	You ate no bread and drank no wine or strong drink, so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
5688	5	29	6	29	7	When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them.
5689	5	29	7	29	8	We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
5690	5	29	8	29	9	So keep and follow the words of this covenant, that you may prosper in all you do.
5691	5	29	9	29	10	All of you are standing today before the LORD your God—you leaders of tribes, elders, officials, and all the men of Israel,
5692	5	29	10	29	11	your children and wives, and the foreigners in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water—
5693	5	29	11	29	12	so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, which He is making with you today, and into His oath,
5694	5	29	12	29	13	and so that He may establish you today as His people, and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
5695	5	29	13	29	14	I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you,
5696	5	29	14	29	15	but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God, as well as with those who are not here today.
5697	5	29	15	29	16	For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way here.
5698	5	29	16	29	17	You saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
5699	5	29	17	29	18	Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit,
5700	5	29	18	29	19	because when such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.’ This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.
5701	5	29	19	29	20	The LORD will never be willing to forgive him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse written in this book will fall upon him. The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven
5702	5	29	20	29	21	and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
5703	5	29	21	29	22	Then the generation to come—your sons who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land—will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it.
5704	5	29	22	29	23	All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it, just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger.
5705	5	29	23	29	24	All the nations will ask, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?’
5706	5	29	24	29	25	And the people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
5707	5	29	25	29	26	They went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods they had not known—gods that the LORD had not given to them.
5708	5	29	26	29	27	Therefore the LORD’s anger burned against this land, and He brought upon it every curse written in this book.
5709	5	29	27	29	28	The LORD uprooted them from their land in His anger, rage, and great wrath, and He cast them into another land, where they are today.’
5710	5	29	28	29	29	The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law.”
5711	5	30	1	30	1	“When all these things come upon you—the blessings and curses I have set before you—and you call them to mind in all the nations to which the LORD your God has banished you,
5712	5	30	2	30	2	and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey His voice with all your heart and all your soul according to everything I am giving you today,
5713	5	30	3	30	3	then He will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you from all the nations to which the LORD your God has scattered you.
5714	5	30	4	30	4	Even if you have been banished to the farthest horizon, He will gather you and return you from there.
5715	5	30	5	30	5	And the LORD your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers.
5716	5	30	6	30	6	The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.
5717	5	30	7	30	7	Then the LORD your God will put all these curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you.
5718	5	30	8	30	8	And you will again obey the voice of the LORD and follow all His commandments I am giving you today.
5719	5	30	9	30	9	So the LORD your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, the LORD will again delight in your goodness, as He delighted in that of your fathers,
5720	5	30	10	30	10	if you obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
5721	5	30	11	30	11	For this commandment I give you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
5722	5	30	12	30	12	It is not in heaven, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
5723	5	30	13	30	13	And it is not beyond the sea, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
5724	5	30	14	30	14	But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may obey it.
5725	5	30	15	30	15	See, I have set before you today life and goodness, as well as death and disaster.
5726	5	30	16	30	16	For I am commanding you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and increase, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
5727	5	30	17	30	17	But if your heart turns away and you do not listen, but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
5728	5	30	18	30	18	I declare to you today that you will surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
5729	5	30	19	30	19	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. So choose life, so that you and your descendants may live,
5730	5	30	20	30	20	and that you may love the LORD your God, obey Him, and hold fast to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
5731	5	31	1	31	1	When Moses had finished speaking these words to all Israel,
5732	5	31	2	31	2	he said to them, “I am now a hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to come and go, and the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’
5733	5	31	3	31	3	The LORD your God Himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will dispossess them. Joshua will cross ahead of you, as the LORD has said.
5734	5	31	4	31	4	And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, when He destroyed them along with their land.
5735	5	31	5	31	5	The LORD will deliver them over to you, and you must do to them exactly as I have commanded you.
5736	5	31	6	31	6	Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or terrified of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.”
5737	5	31	7	31	7	Then Moses called for Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their fathers to give them, and you shall give it to them as an inheritance.
5738	5	31	8	31	8	The LORD Himself goes before you; He will be with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”
5739	5	31	9	31	9	So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
5740	5	31	10	31	10	Then Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of remission of debt, during the Feast of Tabernacles,
5741	5	31	11	31	11	when all Israel comes before the LORD your God at the place He will choose, you are to read this law in the hearing of all Israel.
5742	5	31	12	31	12	Assemble the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners within your gates—so that they may listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and to follow carefully all the words of this law.
5743	5	31	13	31	13	Then their children who do not know the law will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
5744	5	31	14	31	14	Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the time of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.
5745	5	31	15	31	15	Then the LORD appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent.
5746	5	31	16	31	16	And the LORD said to Moses, “You will soon rest with your fathers, and these people will rise up and prostitute themselves with the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake Me and break the covenant I have made with them.
5747	5	31	17	31	17	On that day My anger will burn against them, and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, so that they will be consumed, and many troubles and afflictions will befall them. On that day they will say, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is no longer with us?’
5748	5	31	18	31	18	And on that day I will surely hide My face because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods.
5749	5	31	19	31	19	Now therefore, write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites; have them recite it, so that it may be a witness for Me against them.
5750	5	31	20	31	20	When I have brought them into the land that I swore to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill and prosper. Then they will turn to other gods and worship them, and they will reject Me and break My covenant.
5751	5	31	21	31	21	And when many troubles and afflictions have come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten from the lips of their descendants. For I know their inclination, even before I bring them into the land that I swore to give them.”
5752	5	31	22	31	22	So that very day Moses wrote down this song and taught it to the Israelites.
5753	5	31	23	31	23	Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you.”
5754	5	31	24	31	24	When Moses had finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,
5755	5	31	25	31	25	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD:
5756	5	31	26	31	26	“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you.
5757	5	31	27	31	27	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are already rebelling against the LORD while I am still alive, how much more will you rebel after my death!
5758	5	31	28	31	28	Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officers so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
5759	5	31	29	31	29	For I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. And in the days to come, disaster will befall you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger by the work of your hands.”
5760	5	31	30	31	30	Then Moses recited aloud to the whole assembly of Israel the words of this song from beginning to end:
5761	5	32	1	32	1	Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
5762	5	32	2	32	2	Let my teaching fall like rain and my speech settle like dew, like gentle rain on new grass, like showers on tender plants.
5763	5	32	3	32	3	For I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Ascribe greatness to our God!
5764	5	32	4	32	4	He is the Rock, His work is perfect; all His ways are just. A God of faithfulness without injustice, righteous and upright is He.
5765	5	32	5	32	5	His people have acted corruptly toward Him; the spot on them is not that of His children, but of a perverse and crooked generation.
5766	5	32	6	32	6	Is this how you repay the LORD, O foolish and senseless people? Is He not your Father and Creator? Has He not made you and established you?
5767	5	32	7	32	7	Remember the days of old; consider the years long past. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will inform you.
5768	5	32	8	32	8	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when He divided the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.
5769	5	32	9	32	9	But the LORD’s portion is His people, Jacob His allotted inheritance.
5770	5	32	10	32	10	He found him in a desert land, in a barren, howling wilderness; He surrounded him, He instructed him, He guarded him as the apple of His eye.
5771	5	32	11	32	11	As an eagle stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, He spread His wings to catch them and carried them on His pinions.
5772	5	32	12	32	12	The LORD alone led him, and no foreign god was with him.
5773	5	32	13	32	13	He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from the flinty crag,
5774	5	32	14	32	14	with curds from the herd and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs, with rams from Bashan, and goats, with the choicest grains of wheat. From the juice of the finest grapes you drank the wine.
5775	5	32	15	32	15	But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked—becoming fat, bloated, and gorged. He abandoned the God who made him and scorned the Rock of his salvation.
5776	5	32	16	32	16	They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods; they enraged Him with abominations.
5777	5	32	17	32	17	They sacrificed to demons, not to God, to gods they had not known, to newly arrived gods, which your fathers did not fear.
5778	5	32	18	32	18	You ignored the Rock who brought you forth; you forgot the God who gave you birth.
5779	5	32	19	32	19	When the LORD saw this, He rejected them, provoked to anger by His sons and daughters.
5780	5	32	20	32	20	He said: “I will hide My face from them; I will see what will be their end. For they are a perverse generation—children of unfaithfulness.
5781	5	32	21	32	21	They have provoked My jealousy by that which is not God; they have enraged Me with their worthless idols. So I will make them jealous by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation without understanding.
5782	5	32	22	32	22	For a fire has been kindled by My anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol; it consumes the earth and its produce, and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
5783	5	32	23	32	23	I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend My arrows against them.
5784	5	32	24	32	24	They will be wasted from hunger and ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague; I will send the fangs of wild beasts against them, with the venom of vipers that slither in the dust.
5785	5	32	25	32	25	Outside, the sword will take their children, and inside, terror will strike the young man and the young woman, the infant and the gray-haired man.
5786	5	32	26	32	26	I would have said that I would cut them to pieces and blot out their memory from mankind,
5787	5	32	27	32	27	if I had not dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest their adversaries misunderstand and say: ‘Our own hand has prevailed; it was not the LORD who did all this.’”
5788	5	32	28	32	28	Israel is a nation devoid of counsel, with no understanding among them.
5789	5	32	29	32	29	If only they were wise, they would understand it; they would comprehend their fate.
5790	5	32	30	32	30	How could one man pursue a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?
5791	5	32	31	32	31	For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies concede.
5792	5	32	32	32	32	But their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters are bitter.
5793	5	32	33	32	33	Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.
5794	5	32	34	32	34	“Have I not stored up these things, sealed up within My vaults?
5795	5	32	35	32	35	Vengeance is Mine; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; for their day of disaster is near, and their doom is coming quickly.”
5796	5	32	36	32	36	For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants when He sees that their strength is gone and no one remains, slave or free.
5797	5	32	37	32	37	He will say: “Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge,
5798	5	32	38	32	38	which ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you; let them give you shelter!
5799	5	32	39	32	39	See now that I am He; there is no God besides Me. I bring death and I give life; I wound and I heal, and there is no one who can deliver from My hand.
5800	5	32	40	32	40	For I lift up My hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,
5801	5	32	41	32	41	when I sharpen My flashing sword, and My hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on My adversaries and repay those who hate Me.
5802	5	32	42	32	42	I will make My arrows drunk with blood, while My sword devours flesh—the blood of the slain and captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.”
5803	5	32	43	32	43	Rejoice, O heavens, with Him, and let all God’s angels worship Him. Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His children. He will take vengeance on His adversaries and repay those who hate Him; He will cleanse His land and His people.
5804	5	32	44	32	44	Then Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
5805	5	32	45	32	45	When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
5806	5	32	46	32	46	he said to them, “Take to heart all these words I testify among you today, so that you may command your children to carefully follow all the words of this law.
5807	5	32	47	32	47	For they are not idle words to you, because they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
5808	5	32	48	32	48	On that same day the LORD said to Moses,
5809	5	32	49	32	49	“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as their own possession.
5810	5	32	50	32	50	And there on the mountain that you climb, you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
5811	5	32	51	32	51	For at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence.
5812	5	32	52	32	52	Although you shall see from a distance the land that I am giving the Israelites, you shall not enter it.”
5813	5	33	1	33	1	This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced upon the Israelites before his death.
5814	5	33	2	33	2	He said: “The LORD came from Sinai and dawned upon us from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran and came with myriads of holy ones, with flaming fire at His right hand.
5815	5	33	3	33	3	Surely You love the people; all the holy ones are in Your hand, and they sit down at Your feet; each receives Your words—
5816	5	33	4	33	4	the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
5817	5	33	5	33	5	So the LORD became King in Jeshurun when the leaders of the people gathered, when the tribes of Israel came together.
5818	5	33	6	33	6	Let Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few.”
5819	5	33	7	33	7	And concerning Judah he said: “O LORD, hear the cry of Judah and bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause, but may You be a help against his foes.”
5820	5	33	8	33	8	Concerning Levi he said: “Give Your Thummim to Levi and Your Urim to Your godly one, whom You tested at Massah and contested at the waters of Meribah.
5821	5	33	9	33	9	He said of his father and mother, ‘I do not consider them.’ He disregarded his brothers and did not know his own sons, for he kept Your word and maintained Your covenant.
5822	5	33	10	33	10	He will teach Your ordinances to Jacob and Your law to Israel; he will set incense before You and whole burnt offerings on Your altar.
5823	5	33	11	33	11	Bless his substance, O LORD, and accept the work of his hands. Smash the loins of those who rise against him, and of his foes so they can rise no more.”
5824	5	33	12	33	12	Concerning Benjamin he said: “May the beloved of the LORD rest secure in Him; God shields him all day long, and upon His shoulders he rests.”
5825	5	33	13	33	13	Concerning Joseph he said: “May his land be blessed by the LORD with the precious dew from heaven above and the deep waters that lie beneath,
5826	5	33	14	33	14	with the bountiful harvest from the sun and the abundant yield of the seasons,
5827	5	33	15	33	15	with the best of the ancient mountains and the bounty of the everlasting hills,
5828	5	33	16	33	16	with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it, and with the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush. May these rest on the head of Joseph and crown the brow of the prince of his brothers.
5829	5	33	17	33	17	His majesty is like a firstborn bull, and his horns are like those of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth. Such are the myriads of Ephraim, and such are the thousands of Manasseh.”
5830	5	33	18	33	18	Concerning Zebulun he said: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys, and Issachar, in your tents.
5831	5	33	19	33	19	They will call the peoples to a mountain; there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness. For they will feast on the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand.”
5832	5	33	20	33	20	Concerning Gad he said: “Blessed is he who enlarges the domain of Gad! He lies down like a lion and tears off an arm or a head.
5833	5	33	21	33	21	He chose the best land for himself, because a ruler’s portion was reserved for him there. He came with the leaders of the people; he administered the LORD’s justice and His ordinances for Israel.”
5834	5	33	22	33	22	Concerning Dan he said: “Dan is a lion’s cub, leaping out of Bashan.”
5835	5	33	23	33	23	Concerning Naphtali he said: “Naphtali is abounding with favor, full of the blessing of the LORD; he shall take possession of the sea and the south.”
5836	5	33	24	33	24	And concerning Asher he said: “May Asher be the most blessed of sons; may he be the most favored among his brothers and dip his foot in oil.
5837	5	33	25	33	25	May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze, and may your strength match your days.”
5838	5	33	26	33	26	“There is none like the God of Jeshurun, who rides the heavens to your aid, and the clouds in His majesty.
5839	5	33	27	33	27	The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He drives out the enemy before you, giving the command, ‘Destroy him!’
5840	5	33	28	33	28	So Israel dwells securely; the fountain of Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and new wine, where even the heavens drip with dew.
5841	5	33	29	33	29	Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is the shield that protects you, the sword in which you boast. Your enemies will cower before you, and you shall trample their high places.”
5842	5	34	1	34	1	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land—from Gilead as far as Dan,
5843	5	34	2	34	2	all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,
5844	5	34	3	34	3	the Negev, and the region from the Valley of Jericho (the City of Palms) all the way to Zoar.
5845	5	34	4	34	4	And the LORD said to him, “This is the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it.”
5846	5	34	5	34	5	So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said.
5847	5	34	6	34	6	And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows the location of his grave.
5848	5	34	7	34	7	Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not diminished.
5849	5	34	8	34	8	The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
5850	5	34	9	34	9	Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
5851	5	34	10	34	10	Since that time, no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
5852	5	34	11	34	11	who did all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent him to do against the land of Egypt—to Pharaoh and all his officials and all his land—
5853	5	34	12	34	12	by all the mighty acts of power and awesome deeds that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
5854	6	1	1	1	1	Now after the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying,
5855	6	1	2	1	2	“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.
5856	6	1	3	1	3	I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses.
5857	6	1	4	1	4	Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as the Great Sea.
5858	6	1	5	1	5	No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
5859	6	1	6	1	6	Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them.
5860	6	1	7	1	7	Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go.
5861	6	1	8	1	8	This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; you are to recite it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do.
5862	6	1	9	1	9	Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”
5863	6	1	10	1	10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:
5864	6	1	11	1	11	“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”
5865	6	1	12	1	12	But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
5866	6	1	13	1	13	“Remember what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you when he said, ‘The LORD your God will give you rest, and He will give you this land.’
5867	6	1	14	1	14	Your wives, your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers and help them,
5868	6	1	15	1	15	until the LORD gives them rest as He has done for you, and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you may return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the east side of the Jordan.”
5869	6	1	16	1	16	So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go.
5870	6	1	17	1	17	Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses.
5871	6	1	18	1	18	Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!”
5872	6	2	1	2	1	And Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim, saying, “Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
5873	6	2	2	2	2	And it was reported to the king of Jericho: “Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.”
5874	6	2	3	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, for they have come to spy out the whole land.”
5875	6	2	4	2	4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
5876	6	2	5	2	5	At dusk, when the gate was about to close, the men went out, and I do not know which way they went. Pursue them quickly, and you may catch them!”
5877	6	2	6	2	6	(But Rahab had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she had laid out there.)
5878	6	2	7	2	7	So the king’s men set out in pursuit of the spies along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they had gone out, the gate was shut.
5879	6	2	8	2	8	Before the spies lay down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof
5880	6	2	9	2	9	and said to them, “I know that the LORD has given you this land and that the fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you.
5881	6	2	10	2	10	For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction.
5882	6	2	11	2	11	When we heard this, our hearts melted and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.
5883	6	2	12	2	12	Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD that you will indeed show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
5884	6	2	13	2	13	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will deliver us from death.”
5885	6	2	14	2	14	“Our lives for your lives!” the men agreed. “If you do not report our mission, we will show you kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.”
5886	6	2	15	2	15	Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window, since the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city.
5887	6	2	16	2	16	“Go to the hill country,” she said, “so that your pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there for three days until they have returned; then go on your way.”
5888	6	2	17	2	17	The men said to her, “We will not be bound by this oath you made us swear
5889	6	2	18	2	18	unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house.
5890	6	2	19	2	19	If anyone goes out the door of your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads.
5891	6	2	20	2	20	And if you report our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”
5892	6	2	21	2	21	“Let it be as you say,” she replied, and she sent them away. And when they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
5893	6	2	22	2	22	So the spies went out into the hill country and stayed there three days, until their pursuers had returned without finding them, having searched all along the road.
5894	6	2	23	2	23	Then the two men started back, came down from the hill country, and crossed the river. So they came to Joshua son of Nun and reported all that had happened to them.
5895	6	2	24	2	24	“The LORD has surely delivered the entire land into our hands,” they said to Joshua. “Indeed, all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us.”
5896	6	3	1	3	1	Early the next morning Joshua got up and left Shittim with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
5897	6	3	2	3	2	After three days the officers went through the camp
5898	6	3	3	3	3	and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you are to set out from your positions and follow it.
5899	6	3	4	3	4	But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you can see the way to go, since you have never traveled this way before.”
5900	6	3	5	3	5	Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”
5901	6	3	6	3	6	And he said to the priests, “Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.
5902	6	3	7	3	7	Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.
5903	6	3	8	3	8	Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.’”
5904	6	3	9	3	9	So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.”
5905	6	3	10	3	10	He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.
5906	6	3	11	3	11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.
5907	6	3	12	3	12	Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
5908	6	3	13	3	13	When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth—touch down in the waters of the Jordan, its flowing waters will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.”
5909	6	3	14	3	14	So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them.
5910	6	3	15	3	15	Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,
5911	6	3	16	3	16	the flowing water stood still. It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan, while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
5912	6	3	17	3	17	The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over the dry ground, until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan.
5913	6	4	1	4	1	When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
5914	6	4	2	4	2	“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
5915	6	4	3	4	3	and command them: ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in the place where you spend the night.’”
5916	6	4	4	4	4	So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,
5917	6	4	5	4	5	and said to them, “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel,
5918	6	4	6	4	6	to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’
5919	6	4	7	4	7	you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, its waters were cut off.’ Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.”
5920	6	4	8	4	8	Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down.
5921	6	4	9	4	9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing. And the stones are there to this day.
5922	6	4	10	4	10	Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across,
5923	6	4	11	4	11	and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people.
5924	6	4	12	4	12	The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle as Moses had instructed them.
5925	6	4	13	4	13	About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho.
5926	6	4	14	4	14	On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
5927	6	4	15	4	15	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
5928	6	4	16	4	16	“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.”
5929	6	4	17	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.”
5930	6	4	18	4	18	When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and overflowed all the banks as before.
5931	6	4	19	4	19	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
5932	6	4	20	4	20	And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
5933	6	4	21	4	21	Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’
5934	6	4	22	4	22	you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’
5935	6	4	23	4	23	For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as He did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.
5936	6	4	24	4	24	He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.”
5937	6	5	1	5	1	Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites.
5938	6	5	2	5	2	At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again.”
5939	6	5	3	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
5940	6	5	4	5	4	Now this is why Joshua circumcised them: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war—had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt.
5941	6	5	5	5	5	Though all who had come out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness on the journey from Egypt had been circumcised.
5942	6	5	6	5	6	For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nation’s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
5943	6	5	7	5	7	And Joshua raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones he circumcised. Until this time they were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way.
5944	6	5	8	5	8	And after all the nation had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they were healed.
5945	6	5	9	5	9	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.
5946	6	5	10	5	10	On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover.
5947	6	5	11	5	11	The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
5948	6	5	12	5	12	And the day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. There was no more manna for the Israelites, so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan.
5949	6	5	13	5	13	Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, “Are You for us or for our enemies?”
5950	6	5	14	5	14	“Neither,” He replied. “I have now come as Commander of the LORD’s army.” Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?”
5951	6	5	15	5	15	The Commander of the LORD’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.
5952	6	6	1	6	1	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
5953	6	6	2	6	2	And the LORD said to Joshua, “Behold, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its mighty men of valor.
5954	6	6	3	6	3	March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days.
5955	6	6	4	6	4	Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark. Then on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the horns.
5956	6	6	5	6	5	And when there is a long blast of the ram’s horn and you hear its sound, have all the people give a mighty shout. Then the wall of the city will collapse and all your people will charge straight into the city.”
5957	6	6	6	6	6	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns in front of the ark of the LORD.”
5958	6	6	7	6	7	And he told the people, “Advance and march around the city, with the armed troops going ahead of the ark of the LORD.”
5959	6	6	8	6	8	After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns before the LORD advanced and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
5960	6	6	9	6	9	While the horns continued to sound, the armed troops marched ahead of the priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard followed the ark.
5961	6	6	10	6	10	But Joshua had commanded the people: “Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard; do not let one word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you are to shout!”
5962	6	6	11	6	11	So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. And the people returned to the camp and spent the night there.
5963	6	6	12	6	12	Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests took the ark of the LORD.
5964	6	6	13	6	13	And the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD and blowing the horns. The armed troops went in front of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the horns kept sounding.
5965	6	6	14	6	14	So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
5966	6	6	15	6	15	Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. That was the only day they circled the city seven times.
5967	6	6	16	6	16	After the seventh time around, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!
5968	6	6	17	6	17	Now the city and everything in it must be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live, because she hid the spies we sent.
5969	6	6	18	6	18	But keep away from the things devoted to destruction, lest you yourself be set apart for destruction. If you take any of these, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster upon it.
5970	6	6	19	6	19	For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they must go into His treasury.”
5971	6	6	20	6	20	So when the rams’ horns sounded, the people shouted. When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. Then all the people charged straight into the city and captured it.
5972	6	6	21	6	21	At the edge of the sword they devoted to destruction everything in the city—man and woman, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.
5973	6	6	22	6	22	Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who are with her, just as you promised her.”
5974	6	6	23	6	23	So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
5975	6	6	24	6	24	Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it. However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house.
5976	6	6	25	6	25	And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. So she has lived among the Israelites to this day.
5977	6	6	26	6	26	At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath: “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho; at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”
5978	6	6	27	6	27	So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
5979	6	7	1	7	1	The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the things devoted to destruction. Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart. So the LORD’s anger burned against the Israelites.
5980	6	7	2	7	2	Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
5981	6	7	3	7	3	On returning to Joshua, they reported, “There is no need to send all the people; two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, you need not wear out all our people there.”
5982	6	7	4	7	4	So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai.
5983	6	7	5	7	5	And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries and striking them down on the slopes. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
5984	6	7	6	7	6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown before the ark of the LORD until evening, as did the elders of Israel; and they all sprinkled dust on their heads.
5985	6	7	7	7	7	“O, Lord GOD,” Joshua said, “why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
5986	6	7	8	7	8	O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies?
5987	6	7	9	7	9	When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”
5988	6	7	10	7	10	But the LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?
5989	6	7	11	7	11	Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them, and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction. Indeed, they have stolen and lied, and they have put these things with their own possessions.
5990	6	7	12	7	12	This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they themselves have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.
5991	6	7	13	7	13	Get up and consecrate the people, saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.
5992	6	7	14	7	14	In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family, and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.
5993	6	7	15	7	15	The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction must be burned, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and committed an outrage in Israel.’”
5994	6	7	16	7	16	So Joshua arose early the next morning and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
5995	6	7	17	7	17	He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward, and the family of Zabdi was selected.
5996	6	7	18	7	18	And he had the family of Zabdi come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
5997	6	7	19	7	19	So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you to tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
5998	6	7	20	7	20	“It is true,” Achan replied, “I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did:
5999	6	7	21	7	21	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
6000	6	7	22	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
6001	6	7	23	7	23	They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the LORD.
6002	6	7	24	7	24	Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned, and brought them to the Valley of Achor.
6003	6	7	25	7	25	“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?” said Joshua. “Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!” And all Israel stoned him to death. Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies.
6004	6	7	26	7	26	And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. So the LORD turned from His burning anger. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.
6005	6	8	1	8	1	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. See, I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
6006	6	8	2	8	2	And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”
6007	6	8	3	8	3	So Joshua and the whole army set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out at night
6008	6	8	4	8	4	with these orders: “Pay attention. You are to lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it. All of you must be ready.
6009	6	8	5	8	5	Then I and all the troops with me will advance on the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them.
6010	6	8	6	8	6	They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.’ So as we flee from them,
6011	6	8	7	8	7	you are to rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hands.
6012	6	8	8	8	8	After you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do as the LORD has commanded! See, I have given you orders.”
6013	6	8	9	8	9	So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people.
6014	6	8	10	8	10	Joshua got up early the next morning and mobilized his men, and he and the elders of Israel marched before them up to Ai.
6015	6	8	11	8	11	Then all the troops who were with him marched up and approached the city. They arrived in front of Ai and camped to the north of it, with the valley between them and the city.
6016	6	8	12	8	12	Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
6017	6	8	13	8	13	So the forces were stationed with the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard to the west of the city. And that night Joshua went into the valley.
6018	6	8	14	8	14	When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he hurried out early in the morning with the men of the city to engage them in battle at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
6019	6	8	15	8	15	Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness.
6020	6	8	16	8	16	Then all the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they followed Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
6021	6	8	17	8	17	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city wide open while they pursued Israel.
6022	6	8	18	8	18	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Hold out your battle lance toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out his battle lance toward Ai,
6023	6	8	19	8	19	and as soon as he did so, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
6024	6	8	20	8	20	When the men of Ai turned and looked back, the smoke of the city was rising into the sky. They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers.
6025	6	8	21	8	21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned around and struck down the men of Ai.
6026	6	8	22	8	22	Meanwhile, those in the ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite forces on both sides. So Israel struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained.
6027	6	8	23	8	23	But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
6028	6	8	24	8	24	When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had pursued them into the field and wilderness, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword.
6029	6	8	25	8	25	A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.
6030	6	8	26	8	26	Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai.
6031	6	8	27	8	27	Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD had commanded Joshua.
6032	6	8	28	8	28	So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day.
6033	6	8	29	8	29	He hung the body of the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take down the body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And over it they raised a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day.
6034	6	8	30	8	30	At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel,
6035	6	8	31	8	31	just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.” And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD, and they sacrificed peace offerings.
6036	6	8	32	8	32	And there in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
6037	6	8	33	8	33	All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier to bless the people of Israel.
6038	6	8	34	8	34	Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.
6039	6	8	35	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them.
6040	6	9	1	9	1	Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan—those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—
6041	6	9	2	9	2	they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
6042	6	9	3	9	3	But the people of Gibeon, having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
6043	6	9	4	9	4	acted deceptively and set out as envoys, carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
6044	6	9	5	9	5	They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy.
6045	6	9	6	9	6	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty with us.”
6046	6	9	7	9	7	But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?”
6047	6	9	8	9	8	“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where have you come from?”
6048	6	9	9	9	9	“Your servants have come from a very distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard the reports of Him and all that He did in Egypt,
6049	6	9	10	9	10	as well as all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
6050	6	9	11	9	11	So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them: We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.’
6051	6	9	12	9	12	This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But take a look, it is now dry and moldy.
6052	6	9	13	9	13	These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”
6053	6	9	14	9	14	Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not seek the counsel of the LORD.
6054	6	9	15	9	15	And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
6055	6	9	16	9	16	Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them.
6056	6	9	17	9	17	So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities—Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
6057	6	9	18	9	18	But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
6058	6	9	19	9	19	All the leaders answered, “We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
6059	6	9	20	9	20	This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.”
6060	6	9	21	9	21	They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise.
6061	6	9	22	9	22	Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us?
6062	6	9	23	9	23	Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
6063	6	9	24	9	24	The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants were told clearly that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before you. So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this.
6064	6	9	25	9	25	Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”
6065	6	9	26	9	26	So Joshua did this and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites.
6066	6	9	27	9	27	On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day, for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the place He would choose.
6067	6	10	1	10	1	Now Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and devoted it to destruction—doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living near them.
6068	6	10	2	10	2	So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
6069	6	10	3	10	3	Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,
6070	6	10	4	10	4	“Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
6071	6	10	5	10	5	So the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—joined forces and advanced with all their armies. They camped before Gibeon and made war against it.
6072	6	10	6	10	6	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.”
6073	6	10	7	10	7	So Joshua and his whole army, including all the mighty men of valor, came from Gilgal.
6074	6	10	8	10	8	The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hands. Not one of them shall stand against you.”
6075	6	10	9	10	9	After marching all night from Gilgal, Joshua caught them by surprise.
6076	6	10	10	10	10	The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the ascent to Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
6077	6	10	11	10	11	As they fled before Israel along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky, and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites.
6078	6	10	12	10	12	On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel: “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
6079	6	10	13	10	13	So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? “So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.”
6080	6	10	14	10	14	There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought for Israel.
6081	6	10	15	10	15	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
6082	6	10	16	10	16	Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
6083	6	10	17	10	17	And Joshua was informed: “The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
6084	6	10	18	10	18	So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post men there to guard them.
6085	6	10	19	10	19	But you, do not stop there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”
6086	6	10	20	10	20	So Joshua and the Israelites continued to inflict a terrible slaughter until they had finished them off, and the remaining survivors retreated to the fortified cities.
6087	6	10	21	10	21	The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites.
6088	6	10	22	10	22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.”
6089	6	10	23	10	23	So they brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
6090	6	10	24	10	24	When they had brought the kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks.
6091	6	10	25	10	25	“Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said. “Be strong and courageous, for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight.”
6092	6	10	26	10	26	After this, Joshua struck down and killed the kings, and he hung their bodies on five trees and left them there until evening.
6093	6	10	27	10	27	At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day.
6094	6	10	28	10	28	On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it down with the sword, along with its king. He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
6095	6	10	29	10	29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
6096	6	10	30	10	30	And the LORD also delivered that city and its king into the hands of Israel, and Joshua struck down all the people with the sword, leaving no survivors. And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
6097	6	10	31	10	31	And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish. They laid siege to it and fought against it.
6098	6	10	32	10	32	And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel, and Joshua captured it on the second day. He struck down all the people with the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.
6099	6	10	33	10	33	At that time Horam king of Gezer went to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him down along with his people, leaving no survivors.
6100	6	10	34	10	34	So Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him. They laid siege to it and fought against it.
6101	6	10	35	10	35	That day they captured Eglon and struck it down with the sword, and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city, just as he had done to Lachish.
6102	6	10	36	10	36	Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it.
6103	6	10	37	10	37	They captured it and struck down with the sword its king, all its villages, and all the people. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon; he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it.
6104	6	10	38	10	38	Finally Joshua and all Israel with him turned toward Debir and fought against it.
6105	6	10	39	10	39	And they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages. They struck them down with the sword and devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. Joshua did to Debir and its king as he had done to Hebron and as he had done to Libnah and its king.
6106	6	10	40	10	40	So Joshua conquered the whole region—the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes, together with all their kings—leaving no survivors. He devoted to destruction everything that breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
6107	6	10	41	10	41	Joshua conquered the area from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
6108	6	10	42	10	42	And because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel, Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign.
6109	6	10	43	10	43	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
6110	6	11	1	11	1	Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about these things, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon; to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph;
6111	6	11	2	11	2	to the kings of the north in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Chinnereth, in the foothills, and in Naphoth-dor to the west;
6112	6	11	3	11	3	to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
6113	6	11	4	11	4	So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along with a great number of horses and chariots.
6114	6	11	5	11	5	All these kings joined forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
6115	6	11	6	11	6	Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.”
6116	6	11	7	11	7	So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them,
6117	6	11	8	11	8	and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors.
6118	6	11	9	11	9	Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots.
6119	6	11	10	11	10	At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and struck down its king with the sword, because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.
6120	6	11	11	11	11	The Israelites struck down everyone in Hazor with the sword, devoting them to destruction. Nothing that breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself.
6121	6	11	12	11	12	Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and struck them down with the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as Moses the LORD’s servant had commanded.
6122	6	11	13	11	13	Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
6123	6	11	14	11	14	The Israelites took for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but they struck down all the people with the sword until they had completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone who breathed.
6124	6	11	15	11	15	As the LORD had commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
6125	6	11	16	11	16	So Joshua took this entire region: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their foothills,
6126	6	11	17	11	17	from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.
6127	6	11	18	11	18	Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time.
6128	6	11	19	11	19	No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle.
6129	6	11	20	11	20	For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts to engage Israel in battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would receive no mercy, being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses.
6130	6	11	21	11	21	At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities.
6131	6	11	22	11	22	No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.
6132	6	11	23	11	23	So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes. Then the land had rest from war.
6133	6	12	1	12	1	Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites struck down and whose lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east, from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:
6134	6	12	2	12	2	Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites), that is, half of Gilead,
6135	6	12	3	12	3	as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
6136	6	12	4	12	4	And Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
6137	6	12	5	12	5	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
6138	6	12	6	12	6	Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down and given their land as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6139	6	12	7	12	7	And these are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir (according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance
6140	6	12	8	12	8	the hill country, the foothills, the Arabah, the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev—the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):
6141	6	12	9	12	9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;
6142	6	12	10	12	10	the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
6143	6	12	11	12	11	the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
6144	6	12	12	12	12	the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
6145	6	12	13	12	13	the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
6146	6	12	14	12	14	the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
6147	6	12	15	12	15	the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
6148	6	12	16	12	16	the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
6149	6	12	17	12	17	the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
6150	6	12	18	12	18	the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
6151	6	12	19	12	19	the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
6152	6	12	20	12	20	the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
6153	6	12	21	12	21	the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
6154	6	12	22	12	22	the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
6155	6	12	23	12	23	the king of Dor in Naphath-dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
6156	6	12	24	12	24	and the king of Tirzah, one. So there were thirty-one kings in all.
6157	6	13	1	13	1	Now Joshua was old and well along in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and well along in years, but very much of the land remains to be possessed.
6158	6	13	2	13	2	This is the land that remains: All the territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites,
6159	6	13	3	13	3	from the Shihor east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite territory)—that of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as the Avvites;
6160	6	13	4	13	4	to the south, all the land of the Canaanites, from Mearah of the Sidonians to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites;
6161	6	13	5	13	5	the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath.
6162	6	13	6	13	6	All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim—all the Sidonians—I Myself will drive out before the Israelites. Be sure to divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel, as I have commanded you.
6163	6	13	7	13	7	Now therefore divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
6164	6	13	8	13	8	The other half of Manasseh, along with the Reubenites and Gadites, had received the inheritance Moses had given them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them:
6165	6	13	9	13	9	The area from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,
6166	6	13	10	13	10	and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites;
6167	6	13	11	13	11	also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, all of Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah—
6168	6	13	12	13	12	the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim. Moses had struck them down and dispossessed them,
6169	6	13	13	13	13	but the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites. So Geshur and Maacath dwell among the Israelites to this day.
6170	6	13	14	13	14	To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance. The offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, just as He had promised them.
6171	6	13	15	13	15	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Reuben:
6172	6	13	16	13	16	The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, to the whole plateau beyond Medeba,
6173	6	13	17	13	17	with Heshbon and all its cities on the plateau—Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,
6174	6	13	18	13	18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
6175	6	13	19	13	19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley,
6176	6	13	20	13	20	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth—
6177	6	13	21	13	21	all the cities of the plateau and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon until Moses killed him and the chiefs of Midian—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
6178	6	13	22	13	22	The Israelites also killed the diviner Balaam son of Beor along with the others they put to the sword.
6179	6	13	23	13	23	And the border of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the clans of the Reubenites, including the cities and villages.
6180	6	13	24	13	24	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Gad:
6181	6	13	25	13	25	The territory of Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;
6182	6	13	26	13	26	the territory from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
6183	6	13	27	13	27	and in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, with the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon (the territory on the east side of the Jordan up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth).
6184	6	13	28	13	28	This was the inheritance of the clans of the Gadites, including the cities and villages.
6185	6	13	29	13	29	This is what Moses had given to the clans of the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh:
6186	6	13	30	13	30	The territory from Mahanaim through all Bashan—all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, including all the towns of Jair that are in Bashan, sixty cities;
6187	6	13	31	13	31	half of Gilead; and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the royal cities of Og in Bashan. All this was for the clans of the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh, that is, half of the descendants of Machir.
6188	6	13	32	13	32	These were the portions Moses had given them on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho.
6189	6	13	33	13	33	To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance. The LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, just as He had promised them.
6190	6	14	1	14	1	Now these are the portions that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, as distributed by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of Israel.
6191	6	14	2	14	2	Their inheritance was assigned by lot for the nine and a half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
6192	6	14	3	14	3	For Moses had given the inheritance east of the Jordan to the other two and a half tribes. But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites.
6193	6	14	4	14	4	The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion of the land was given to the Levites, except for cities in which to live, along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
6194	6	14	5	14	5	So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
6195	6	14	6	14	6	Then the sons of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh-barnea about you and me.
6196	6	14	7	14	7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back to him an honest report.
6197	6	14	8	14	8	Although my brothers who went with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear, I remained loyal to the LORD my God.
6198	6	14	9	14	9	On that day Moses swore to me, saying, ‘Surely the land on which you have set foot will be an inheritance to you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’
6199	6	14	10	14	10	Now behold, as the LORD promised, He has kept me alive these forty-five years since He spoke this word to Moses, while Israel wandered in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old,
6200	6	14	11	14	11	still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. As my strength was then, so it is now for war, for going out, and for coming in.
6201	6	14	12	14	12	Now therefore give me this hill country that the LORD promised me on that day, for you yourself heard then that the Anakim were there, with great and fortified cities. Perhaps with the LORD’s help I will drive them out, as the LORD has spoken.”
6202	6	14	13	14	13	Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
6203	6	14	14	14	14	Therefore Hebron belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
6204	6	14	15	14	15	(Hebron used to be called Kiriath-arba, after Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim.) Then the land had rest from war.
6205	6	15	1	15	1	Now the allotment for the clans of the tribe of Judah extended to the border of Edom, to the Wilderness of Zin at the extreme southern boundary:
6206	6	15	2	15	2	Their southern border started at the bay on the southern tip of the Salt Sea,
6207	6	15	3	15	3	proceeded south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continued on to Zin, went over to the south of Kadesh-barnea, ran past Hezron up to Addar, and curved toward Karka.
6208	6	15	4	15	4	It proceeded to Azmon, joined the Brook of Egypt, and ended at the Sea. This was their southern border.
6209	6	15	5	15	5	The eastern border was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern border started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
6210	6	15	6	15	6	went up to Beth-hoglah, proceeded north of Beth-arabah, and went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
6211	6	15	7	15	7	Then the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning north to Gilgal, which faces the Ascent of Adummim south of the ravine. It continued along the waters of En-shemesh and came out at En-rogel.
6212	6	15	8	15	8	From there the border went up the Valley of Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem) and ascended to the top of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom on the west, at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
6213	6	15	9	15	9	From the hilltop the border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron, and then bent around toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).
6214	6	15	10	15	10	The border curled westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), went down to Beth-shemesh, and crossed to Timnah.
6215	6	15	11	15	11	Then it went out to the northern slope of Ekron, curved toward Shikkeron, proceeded to Mount Baalah, went on to Jabneel, and ended at the Sea.
6216	6	15	12	15	12	And the western border was the coastline of the Great Sea. These are the boundaries around the clans of the descendants of Judah.
6217	6	15	13	15	13	According to the LORD’s command to him, Joshua gave Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah—Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
6218	6	15	14	15	14	And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak—the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
6219	6	15	15	15	15	From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).
6220	6	15	16	15	16	And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who strikes down and captures Kiriath-sepher.”
6221	6	15	17	15	17	So Othniel son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz took it, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
6222	6	15	18	15	18	Later, Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What would you like?”
6223	6	15	19	15	19	“Give me a blessing,” she replied. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
6224	6	15	20	15	20	This is the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Judah.
6225	6	15	21	15	21	These were the southernmost cities of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the border of Edom: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
6226	6	15	22	15	22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
6227	6	15	23	15	23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
6228	6	15	24	15	24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
6229	6	15	25	15	25	Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
6230	6	15	26	15	26	Amam, Shema, Moladah,
6231	6	15	27	15	27	Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
6232	6	15	28	15	28	Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,
6233	6	15	29	15	29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
6234	6	15	30	15	30	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,
6235	6	15	31	15	31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
6236	6	15	32	15	32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon—twenty-nine cities in all, along with their villages.
6237	6	15	33	15	33	These were in the foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah,
6238	6	15	34	15	34	Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
6239	6	15	35	15	35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
6240	6	15	36	15	36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah (or Gederothaim)—fourteen cities, along with their villages.
6241	6	15	37	15	37	Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
6242	6	15	38	15	38	Dilan, Mizpeh, Joktheel,
6243	6	15	39	15	39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
6244	6	15	40	15	40	Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish,
6245	6	15	41	15	41	Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah—sixteen cities, along with their villages.
6246	6	15	42	15	42	Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
6247	6	15	43	15	43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
6248	6	15	44	15	44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah—nine cities, along with their villages.
6249	6	15	45	15	45	Ekron, with its towns and villages;
6250	6	15	46	15	46	from Ekron to the sea, all the cities near Ashdod, along with their villages;
6251	6	15	47	15	47	Ashdod, with its towns and villages; Gaza, with its towns and villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea.
6252	6	15	48	15	48	These were in the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
6253	6	15	49	15	49	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
6254	6	15	50	15	50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
6255	6	15	51	15	51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh—eleven cities, along with their villages.
6256	6	15	52	15	52	Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
6257	6	15	53	15	53	Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
6258	6	15	54	15	54	Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior—nine cities, along with their villages.
6259	6	15	55	15	55	Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
6260	6	15	56	15	56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
6261	6	15	57	15	57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah—ten cities, along with their villages.
6262	6	15	58	15	58	Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
6263	6	15	59	15	59	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon—six cities, along with their villages.
6264	6	15	60	15	60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah—two cities, along with their villages.
6265	6	15	61	15	61	These were in the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
6266	6	15	62	15	62	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi—six cities, along with their villages.
6267	6	15	63	15	63	But the descendants of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there among the descendants of Judah.
6268	6	16	1	16	1	The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness that goes up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.
6269	6	16	2	16	2	It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz) and proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth.
6270	6	16	3	16	3	Then it descended westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth-horon and on to Gezer, and it ended at the Sea.
6271	6	16	4	16	4	So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance.
6272	6	16	5	16	5	This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans: The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth-addar in the east to Upper Beth-horon
6273	6	16	6	16	6	and out toward the Sea. From Michmethath on the north it turned eastward toward Taanath-shiloh and passed by it to Janoah on the east.
6274	6	16	7	16	7	From Janoah it went down to Ataroth and Naarah, and then reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
6275	6	16	8	16	8	From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook of Kanah and ended at the Sea. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Ephraim,
6276	6	16	9	16	9	along with all the cities and villages set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh.
6277	6	16	10	16	10	But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, but they are forced laborers.
6278	6	17	1	17	1	Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn son, namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war.
6279	6	17	2	17	2	So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
6280	6	17	3	17	3	But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh) had no sons but only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
6281	6	17	4	17	4	They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers, in keeping with the command of the LORD.
6282	6	17	5	17	5	Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan,
6283	6	17	6	17	6	because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
6284	6	17	7	17	7	Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem, then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
6285	6	17	8	17	8	The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim.
6286	6	17	9	17	9	From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah. There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Sea.
6287	6	17	10	17	10	Ephraim’s territory was to the south, and Manasseh’s was to the north, having the Sea as its border and adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
6288	6	17	11	17	11	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was assigned Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphath), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements.
6289	6	17	12	17	12	But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land.
6290	6	17	13	17	13	However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they put the Canaanites to forced labor; but they failed to drive them out completely.
6291	6	17	14	17	14	Then the sons of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance? We have many people, because the LORD has blessed us abundantly.”
6292	6	17	15	17	15	Joshua answered them, “If you have so many people that the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go to the forest and clear for yourself an area in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.”
6293	6	17	16	17	16	“The hill country is not enough for us,” they replied, “and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both in Beth-shean with its towns and in the valley of Jezreel.”
6294	6	17	17	17	17	So Joshua said to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You have many people and great strength. You shall not have just one allotment,
6295	6	17	18	17	18	because the hill country will be yours as well. It is a forest; clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have iron chariots, and although they are strong, you can drive them out.”
6296	6	18	1	18	1	Then the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. And though the land was subdued before them,
6297	6	18	2	18	2	there were still seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance.
6298	6	18	3	18	3	So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
6299	6	18	4	18	4	Appoint three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me
6300	6	18	5	18	5	and divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.
6301	6	18	6	18	6	When you have mapped out the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God.
6302	6	18	7	18	7	The Levites, however, have no portion among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.”
6303	6	18	8	18	8	As the men got up to go out, Joshua commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.”
6304	6	18	9	18	9	So the men departed and went throughout the land, mapping it city by city into seven portions. Then they returned with the document to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
6305	6	18	10	18	10	And Joshua cast lots for them in the presence of the LORD at Shiloh, where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.
6306	6	18	11	18	11	The first lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:
6307	6	18	12	18	12	On the north side their border began at the Jordan, went up past the northern slope of Jericho, headed west through the hill country, and came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
6308	6	18	13	18	13	From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth-addar on the hill south of Lower Beth-horon.
6309	6	18	14	18	14	On the west side the border curved southward from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south and came out at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the western side.
6310	6	18	15	18	15	On the south side the border began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim and extended westward to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah.
6311	6	18	16	18	16	Then it went down to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites and downward to En-rogel.
6312	6	18	17	18	17	From there it curved northward and proceeded to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth facing the Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
6313	6	18	18	18	18	Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah and went down into the valley.
6314	6	18	19	18	19	The border continued to the northern slope of Beth-hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
6315	6	18	20	18	20	On the east side the border was the Jordan. These were the borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
6316	6	18	21	18	21	These were the cities of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,
6317	6	18	22	18	22	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
6318	6	18	23	18	23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
6319	6	18	24	18	24	Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba—twelve cities, along with their villages.
6320	6	18	25	18	25	Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
6321	6	18	26	18	26	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
6322	6	18	27	18	27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
6323	6	18	28	18	28	Zelah, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim—fourteen cities, along with their villages. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
6324	6	19	1	19	1	The second lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Simeon: Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah
6325	6	19	2	19	2	and included Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,
6326	6	19	3	19	3	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem,
6327	6	19	4	19	4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
6328	6	19	5	19	5	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah,
6329	6	19	6	19	6	Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen—thirteen cities, along with their villages.
6330	6	19	7	19	7	Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities, along with their villages,
6331	6	19	8	19	8	and all the villages surrounding these cities as far as Baalath-beer (Ramah of the Negev). This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Simeon.
6332	6	19	9	19	9	The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the territory of Judah, because the share for Judah’s descendants was too large for them. So the Simeonites received an inheritance within Judah’s portion.
6333	6	19	10	19	10	The third lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Zebulun: The border of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid.
6334	6	19	11	19	11	It went up westward to Maralah, reached Dabbesheth, and met the brook east of Jokneam.
6335	6	19	12	19	12	From Sarid it turned eastward along the border of Chisloth-tabor and went on to Daberath and up to Japhia.
6336	6	19	13	19	13	From there it crossed eastward to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin; it extended to Rimmon and curved around toward Neah.
6337	6	19	14	19	14	Then the border circled around the north side of Neah to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah-el.
6338	6	19	15	19	15	It also included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, along with their villages.
6339	6	19	16	19	16	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Zebulun, including these cities and their villages.
6340	6	19	17	19	17	The fourth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Issachar:
6341	6	19	18	19	18	Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,
6342	6	19	19	19	19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
6343	6	19	20	19	20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
6344	6	19	21	19	21	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.
6345	6	19	22	19	22	The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen cities, along with their villages.
6346	6	19	23	19	23	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Issachar, including these cities and their villages.
6347	6	19	24	19	24	The fifth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Asher:
6348	6	19	25	19	25	Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
6349	6	19	26	19	26	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west the border touched Carmel and Shihor-libnath,
6350	6	19	27	19	27	then turned eastward toward Beth-dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah-el, and went north to Beth-emek and Neiel, passing Cabul on the left.
6351	6	19	28	19	28	It went on to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
6352	6	19	29	19	29	The border then turned back toward Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah, and came out at the Sea in the region of Achzib,
6353	6	19	30	19	30	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two cities, along with their villages.
6354	6	19	31	19	31	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Asher, including these cities and their villages.
6355	6	19	32	19	32	The sixth lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Naphtali:
6356	6	19	33	19	33	Their border started at Heleph and the great tree of Zaanannim, passing Adami-nekeb and Jabneel as far as Lakkum and ending at the Jordan.
6357	6	19	34	19	34	Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and ran from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun on the south side, Asher on the west, and Judah at the Jordan on the east.
6358	6	19	35	19	35	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
6359	6	19	36	19	36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
6360	6	19	37	19	37	Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor,
6361	6	19	38	19	38	Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. There were nineteen cities, along with their villages.
6362	6	19	39	19	39	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Naphtali, including these cities and their villages.
6363	6	19	40	19	40	The seventh lot came out for the clans of the tribe of Dan:
6364	6	19	41	19	41	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh,
6365	6	19	42	19	42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
6366	6	19	43	19	43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
6367	6	19	44	19	44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
6368	6	19	45	19	45	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon,
6369	6	19	46	19	46	Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, including the territory across from Joppa.
6370	6	19	47	19	47	(Later, when the territory of the Danites was lost to them, they went up and fought against Leshem, captured it, and struck it down with the sword. So they took possession of Leshem, settled there, and renamed it after their father Dan.)
6371	6	19	48	19	48	This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Dan, including these cities and their villages.
6372	6	19	49	19	49	When they had finished distributing the land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,
6373	6	19	50	19	50	as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the city of Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, as he requested. He rebuilt the city and settled in it.
6374	6	19	51	19	51	These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families distributed by lot to the tribes of Israel at Shiloh before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing up the land.
6375	6	20	1	20	1	Then the LORD said to Joshua,
6376	6	20	2	20	2	“Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,
6377	6	20	3	20	3	so that anyone who kills another unintentionally or accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
6378	6	20	4	20	4	When someone flees to one of these cities, stands at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before its elders, they are to bring him into the city and give him a place to live among them.
6379	6	20	5	20	5	Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not deliver the manslayer into his hands, because that man killed his neighbor accidentally without prior malice.
6380	6	20	6	20	6	He is to stay in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest serving at that time. Then the manslayer may return to his own home in the city from which he fled.”
6381	6	20	7	20	7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
6382	6	20	8	20	8	And beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho, they designated Bezer on the wilderness plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
6383	6	20	9	20	9	These are the cities appointed for all the Israelites and foreigners among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
6384	6	21	1	21	1	Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribes of Israel
6385	6	21	2	21	2	at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said to them, “The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities in which to live, along with pasturelands for our livestock.”
6386	6	21	3	21	3	So by the command of the LORD, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands out of their own inheritance:
6387	6	21	4	21	4	The first lot came out for the Kohathite clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
6388	6	21	5	21	5	The remaining descendants of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6389	6	21	6	21	6	The descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
6390	6	21	7	21	7	And the descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
6391	6	21	8	21	8	So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these cities along with their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
6392	6	21	9	21	9	From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they designated these cities by name
6393	6	21	10	21	10	to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them:
6394	6	21	11	21	11	They gave them Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pasturelands, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.)
6395	6	21	12	21	12	But they had given the fields and villages around the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
6396	6	21	13	21	13	So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave these cities with their pasturelands: Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Libnah,
6397	6	21	14	21	14	Jattir, Eshtemoa,
6398	6	21	15	21	15	Holon, Debir,
6399	6	21	16	21	16	Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh—nine cities from these two tribes, along with their pasturelands.
6400	6	21	17	21	17	And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba,
6401	6	21	18	21	18	Anathoth, and Almon—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6402	6	21	19	21	19	In all, thirteen cities with their pasturelands were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
6403	6	21	20	21	20	The remaining Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted these cities: From the tribe of Ephraim
6404	6	21	21	21	21	they were given Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Gezer,
6405	6	21	22	21	22	Kibzaim, and Beth-horon—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6406	6	21	23	21	23	From the tribe of Dan they were given Elteke, Gibbethon,
6407	6	21	24	21	24	Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6408	6	21	25	21	25	And from the half-tribe of Manasseh they were given Taanach and Gath-rimmon—two cities, along with their pasturelands.
6409	6	21	26	21	26	In all, ten cities with their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
6410	6	21	27	21	27	This is what the Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: From the half-tribe of Manasseh they received Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the manslayer, and Beeshterah—two cities, along with their pasturelands.
6411	6	21	28	21	28	From the tribe of Issachar they received Kishion, Daberath,
6412	6	21	29	21	29	Jarmuth, and En-gannim—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6413	6	21	30	21	30	From the tribe of Asher they received Mishal, Abdon,
6414	6	21	31	21	31	Helkath, and Rehob—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6415	6	21	32	21	32	And from the tribe of Naphtali they received Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—three cities, along with their pasturelands.
6416	6	21	33	21	33	In all, thirteen cities with their pasturelands were given to the Gershonite clans.
6417	6	21	34	21	34	This is what the Merarite clan (the rest of the Levites) were given: From the tribe of Zebulun they received Jokneam, Kartah,
6418	6	21	35	21	35	Dimnah, and Nahalal—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6419	6	21	36	21	36	From the tribe of Reuben they received Bezer, Jahaz,
6420	6	21	37	21	37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath—four cities, along with their pasturelands.
6421	6	21	38	21	38	And from the tribe of Gad they received Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Mahanaim,
6422	6	21	39	21	39	Heshbon, and Jazer—four cities in all, along with their pasturelands.
6423	6	21	40	21	40	In all, twelve cities were allotted to the clans of Merari, the remaining Levite clans.
6424	6	21	41	21	41	So in all there were forty-eight cities for the Levites, along with their pasturelands, within the territory of the Israelites.
6425	6	21	42	21	42	Each of these cities had its own surrounding pasturelands; this was true for all the cities.
6426	6	21	43	21	43	Thus the LORD gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their fathers, and they took possession of it and settled in it.
6427	6	21	44	21	44	And the LORD gave them rest on every side, just as He had sworn to their fathers. None of their enemies could stand against them, for the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
6428	6	21	45	21	45	Not one of all the LORD’s good promises to the house of Israel had failed; everything was fulfilled.
6429	6	22	1	22	1	Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
6430	6	22	2	22	2	and told them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and you have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you.
6431	6	22	3	22	3	All this time you have not deserted your brothers, up to this very day, but have kept the charge given you by the LORD your God.
6432	6	22	4	22	4	And now that the LORD your God has given your brothers rest as He promised them, you may return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you across the Jordan.
6433	6	22	5	22	5	But be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you: to love the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”
6434	6	22	6	22	6	So Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way, and they went to their homes.
6435	6	22	7	22	7	(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers.) When Joshua sent them to their homes he blessed them,
6436	6	22	8	22	8	saying, “Return to your homes with your great wealth, with immense herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and very many clothes. Divide with your brothers the spoil of your enemies.”
6437	6	22	9	22	9	So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to return to their own land of Gilead, which they had acquired according to the command of the LORD through Moses.
6438	6	22	10	22	10	And when they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.
6439	6	22	11	22	11	Then the Israelites received the report: “Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the border of the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.”
6440	6	22	12	22	12	And when they heard this, the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh to go to war against them.
6441	6	22	13	22	13	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gilead, to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
6442	6	22	14	22	14	With him they sent ten chiefs—one family leader from each tribe of Israel, each the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
6443	6	22	15	22	15	They went to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and said to them,
6444	6	22	16	22	16	“This is what the whole congregation of the LORD says: ‘What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel by turning away from the LORD and building for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel against the LORD this day?
6445	6	22	17	22	17	Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day? It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD.
6446	6	22	18	22	18	And now, would you turn away from the LORD? If you rebel today against the LORD, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
6447	6	22	19	22	19	If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD’s possession, where the LORD’s tabernacle stands, and take possession of it among us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.
6448	6	22	20	22	20	Was not Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction, bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel? Yet it was not only Achan who perished because of his sin!’”
6449	6	22	21	22	21	Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the clans of Israel:
6450	6	22	22	22	22	“The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! He knows, and may Israel also know. If this was in rebellion or breach of faith against the LORD, do not spare us today.
6451	6	22	23	22	23	If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from Him and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the LORD Himself hold us accountable.
6452	6	22	24	22	24	But in fact we have done this for fear that in the future your descendants might say to ours, ‘What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
6453	6	22	25	22	25	For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no share in the LORD!’ So your descendants could cause ours to stop fearing the LORD.
6454	6	22	26	22	26	That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.
6455	6	22	27	22	27	Rather, let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come, that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.’ Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours, ‘You have no share in the LORD!’
6456	6	22	28	22	28	Therefore we said, ‘If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the altar of the LORD that our fathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’
6457	6	22	29	22	29	Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God, which stands before His tabernacle.”
6458	6	22	30	22	30	When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation—the heads of Israel’s clans who were with him—heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were satisfied.
6459	6	22	31	22	31	Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this breach of faith against Him. Consequently, you have delivered the Israelites from the hand of the LORD.”
6460	6	22	32	22	32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, together with the other leaders, returned to the Israelites in the land of Canaan and brought back a report regarding the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead.
6461	6	22	33	22	33	The Israelites were satisfied with the report, and they praised God and spoke no more about going to war against them to destroy the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
6462	6	22	34	22	34	So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar Witness, for they said, “It is a witness between us that the LORD is God.”
6463	6	23	1	23	1	A long time after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, when Joshua was old and well along in years,
6464	6	23	2	23	2	he summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers. “I am old and well along in years,” he said,
6465	6	23	3	23	3	“and you have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, because it was the LORD your God who fought for you.
6466	6	23	4	23	4	See, I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations, including all the nations I have already cut off, from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea.
6467	6	23	5	23	5	The LORD your God will push them out of your way and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you.
6468	6	23	6	23	6	Be very strong, then, so that you can keep and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not turning aside from it to the right or to the left.
6469	6	23	7	23	7	So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among you. You must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them, and you must not serve them or bow down to them.
6470	6	23	8	23	8	Instead, you shall hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
6471	6	23	9	23	9	The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and to this day no one can stand against you.
6472	6	23	10	23	10	One of you can put a thousand to flight, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as He promised.
6473	6	23	11	23	11	Therefore watch yourselves carefully, that you love the LORD your God.
6474	6	23	12	23	12	For if you turn away and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you, and if you intermarry and associate with them,
6475	6	23	13	23	13	know for sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge for your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you.
6476	6	23	14	23	14	Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.
6477	6	23	15	23	15	But just as every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come to pass, likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you.
6478	6	23	16	23	16	If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the LORD’s anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you.”
6479	6	24	1	24	1	Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.
6480	6	24	2	24	2	And Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your fathers, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates and worshiped other gods.
6481	6	24	3	24	3	But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac,
6482	6	24	4	24	4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
6483	6	24	5	24	5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and afterward I brought you out.
6484	6	24	6	24	6	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
6485	6	24	7	24	7	So your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, over whom He brought the sea and engulfed them. Your very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
6486	6	24	8	24	8	Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands, that you should possess their land when I destroyed them before you.
6487	6	24	9	24	9	Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you,
6488	6	24	10	24	10	but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you from his hand.
6489	6	24	11	24	11	After this, you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I gave them into your hands.
6490	6	24	12	24	12	I sent the hornet ahead of you, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you, but not by your own sword or bow.
6491	6	24	13	24	13	So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities that you did not build, and now you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’
6492	6	24	14	24	14	Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
6493	6	24	15	24	15	But if it is unpleasing in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!”
6494	6	24	16	24	16	The people replied, “Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods!
6495	6	24	17	24	17	For the LORD our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us throughout our journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.
6496	6	24	18	24	18	And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because He is our God!”
6497	6	24	19	24	19	But Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins.
6498	6	24	20	24	20	If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on you and consume you, even after He has been good to you.”
6499	6	24	21	24	21	“No!” replied the people. “We will serve the LORD!”
6500	6	24	22	24	22	Then Joshua told them, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.” “We are witnesses!” they said.
6501	6	24	23	24	23	“Now, therefore,” he said, “get rid of the foreign gods among you and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”
6502	6	24	24	24	24	So the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God and obey His voice.”
6503	6	24	25	24	25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and ordinance.
6504	6	24	26	24	26	Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was near the sanctuary of the LORD.
6505	6	24	27	24	27	And Joshua said to all the people, “You see this stone. It will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us, and it will be a witness against you if you ever deny your God.”
6506	6	24	28	24	28	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
6507	6	24	29	24	29	Some time later, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
6508	6	24	30	24	30	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
6509	6	24	31	24	31	Israel had served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced all the works that the LORD had done for Israel.
6510	6	24	32	24	32	And the bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the plot of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. So it became an inheritance for Joseph’s descendants.
6511	6	24	33	24	33	Eleazar son of Aaron also died, and they buried him at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
6512	7	1	1	1	1	After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the LORD, “Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?”
6513	7	1	2	1	2	“Judah shall go up,” answered the LORD. “Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.”
6514	7	1	3	1	3	Then the men of Judah said to their brothers the Simeonites, “Come up with us to our allotted territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. And we likewise will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with them.
6515	7	1	4	1	4	When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
6516	7	1	5	1	5	And there they found Adoni-bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
6517	7	1	6	1	6	As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
6518	7	1	7	1	7	Then Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.
6519	7	1	8	1	8	Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
6520	7	1	9	1	9	Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills.
6521	7	1	10	1	10	Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
6522	7	1	11	1	11	From there they marched against the residents of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).
6523	7	1	12	1	12	And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.”
6524	7	1	13	1	13	So Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
6525	7	1	14	1	14	One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?”
6526	7	1	15	1	15	“Give me a blessing,” she answered. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water as well.” So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
6527	7	1	16	1	16	Now the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad. They went to live among the people.
6528	7	1	17	1	17	Then the men of Judah went with their brothers the Simeonites, attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and devoted the city to destruction. So it was called Hormah.
6529	7	1	18	1	18	And Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron—each with its territory.
6530	7	1	19	1	19	The LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had chariots of iron.
6531	7	1	20	1	20	Just as Moses had promised, Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak.
6532	7	1	21	1	21	The Benjamites, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. And to this day the Jebusites dwell among the Benjamites in Jerusalem.
6533	7	1	22	1	22	The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
6534	7	1	23	1	23	They sent spies to Bethel (formerly known as Luz),
6535	7	1	24	1	24	and when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us how to get into the city, and we will treat you kindly.”
6536	7	1	25	1	25	So the man showed them the entrance to the city, and they put the city to the sword but released that man and all his family.
6537	7	1	26	1	26	And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
6538	7	1	27	1	27	At that time Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.
6539	7	1	28	1	28	When Israel became stronger, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor, but they never drove them out completely.
6540	7	1	29	1	29	Ephraim also failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer.
6541	7	1	30	1	30	Zebulun failed to drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and served as forced laborers.
6542	7	1	31	1	31	Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.
6543	7	1	32	1	32	So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.
6544	7	1	33	1	33	Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. So the Naphtalites also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced laborers.
6545	7	1	34	1	34	The Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country and did not allow them to come down into the plain.
6546	7	1	35	1	35	And the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the house of Joseph grew in strength, they pressed the Amorites into forced labor.
6547	7	1	36	1	36	And the border of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim to Sela and beyond.
6548	7	2	1	2	1	Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I had promised to your fathers, and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,
6549	7	2	2	2	2	and you are not to make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall tear down their altars.’ Yet you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done?
6550	7	2	3	2	3	So now I tell you that I will not drive out these people before you; they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.”
6551	7	2	4	2	4	When the angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
6552	7	2	5	2	5	So they called that place Bochim and offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
6553	7	2	6	2	6	After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelites went out to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
6554	7	2	7	2	7	And the people served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him, who had seen all the great works that the LORD had done for Israel.
6555	7	2	8	2	8	And Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
6556	7	2	9	2	9	They buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
6557	7	2	10	2	10	After that whole generation had also been gathered to their fathers, another generation rose up who did not know the LORD or the works that He had done for Israel.
6558	7	2	11	2	11	And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
6559	7	2	12	2	12	Thus they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed after various gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and provoked the LORD to anger,
6560	7	2	13	2	13	for they forsook Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
6561	7	2	14	2	14	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
6562	7	2	15	2	15	Wherever Israel marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity, just as He had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed.
6563	7	2	16	2	16	Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them.
6564	7	2	17	2	17	Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD’s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done.
6565	7	2	18	2	18	Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
6566	7	2	19	2	19	But when the judge died, the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
6567	7	2	20	2	20	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice,
6568	7	2	21	2	21	I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
6569	7	2	22	2	22	In this way I will test whether Israel will keep the way of the LORD by walking in it as their fathers did.”
6570	7	2	23	2	23	That is why the LORD had left those nations in place and had not driven them out immediately by delivering them into the hand of Joshua.
6571	7	3	1	3	1	These are the nations that the LORD left to test all the Israelites who had not known any of the wars in Canaan,
6572	7	3	2	3	2	if only to teach warfare to the subsequent generations of Israel, especially to those who had not known it formerly:
6573	7	3	3	3	3	the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.
6574	7	3	4	3	4	These nations were left to test the Israelites, to find out whether they would keep the commandments of the LORD, which He had given their fathers through Moses.
6575	7	3	5	3	5	Thus the Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
6576	7	3	6	3	6	And they took the daughters of these people in marriage, gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
6577	7	3	7	3	7	So the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
6578	7	3	8	3	8	Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim, and the Israelites served him eight years.
6579	7	3	9	3	9	But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD, He raised up Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s youngest brother, as a deliverer to save them.
6580	7	3	10	3	10	The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge and went out to war. And the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hand of Othniel, who prevailed against him.
6581	7	3	11	3	11	So the land had rest for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
6582	7	3	12	3	12	Once again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
6583	7	3	13	3	13	After enlisting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join forces with him, Eglon attacked and defeated Israel, taking possession of the City of Palms.
6584	7	3	14	3	14	The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
6585	7	3	15	3	15	And again they cried out to the LORD, and He raised up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite, as their deliverer. So they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
6586	7	3	16	3	16	Now Ehud had made for himself a double-edged sword a cubit long. He strapped it to his right thigh under his cloak
6587	7	3	17	3	17	and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was an obese man.
6588	7	3	18	3	18	After Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he ushered out those who had carried it.
6589	7	3	19	3	19	But upon reaching the idols near Gilgal, he himself turned back and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” “Silence,” said the king, and all his attendants left him.
6590	7	3	20	3	20	Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in the coolness of his upper room. “I have a word from God for you,” Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat.
6591	7	3	21	3	21	And Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly.
6592	7	3	22	3	22	Even the handle sank in after the blade, and Eglon’s fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And Eglon’s bowels emptied.
6593	7	3	23	3	23	Then Ehud went out through the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upper room behind him.
6594	7	3	24	3	24	After Ehud was gone, Eglon’s servants came in and found the doors of the upper room locked. “He must be relieving himself in the cool room,” they said.
6595	7	3	25	3	25	So they waited until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened the doors—and there was their lord lying dead on the floor.
6596	7	3	26	3	26	Ehud, however, had escaped while the servants waited. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.
6597	7	3	27	3	27	On arriving in Seirah, he blew the ram’s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hills, and he became their leader.
6598	7	3	28	3	28	“Follow me,” he told them, “for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hands.” So they followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.
6599	7	3	29	3	29	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men. Not one of them escaped.
6600	7	3	30	3	30	So Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel that day, and the land had rest for eighty years.
6601	7	3	31	3	31	After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. And he too saved Israel, striking down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.
6602	7	4	1	4	1	After Ehud died, the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the LORD.
6603	7	4	2	4	2	So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his forces was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.
6604	7	4	3	4	3	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
6605	7	4	4	4	4	Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
6606	7	4	5	4	5	And she would sit under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, where the Israelites would go up to her for judgment.
6607	7	4	6	4	6	She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “Surely the LORD, the God of Israel, is commanding you: ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun.
6608	7	4	7	4	7	And I will draw out Sisera the commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his troops to the River Kishon, and I will deliver him into your hands.’”
6609	7	4	8	4	8	Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”
6610	7	4	9	4	9	“I will certainly go with you,” Deborah replied, “but the road you are taking will bring you no honor, because the LORD will be selling Sisera into the hand of a woman.” So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh,
6611	7	4	10	4	10	where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali; ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.
6612	7	4	11	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent by the great tree of Zaanannim, which was near Kedesh.
6613	7	4	12	4	12	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor,
6614	7	4	13	4	13	he summoned all nine hundred of his iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the River Kishon.
6615	7	4	14	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise, for this is the day that the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hands. Has not the LORD gone before you?” So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.
6616	7	4	15	4	15	And in front of him the LORD routed with the sword Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.
6617	7	4	16	4	16	Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a single man was left.
6618	7	4	17	4	17	Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
6619	7	4	18	4	18	Jael went out to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord. Come in with me. Do not be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
6620	7	4	19	4	19	Sisera said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again.
6621	7	4	20	4	20	“Stand at the entrance to the tent,” he said, “and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here?’ say, ‘No.’”
6622	7	4	21	4	21	But as he lay sleeping from exhaustion, Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went silently to Sisera. She drove the peg through his temple and into the ground, and he died.
6623	7	4	22	4	22	When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to greet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with a tent peg through his temple.
6624	7	4	23	4	23	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.
6625	7	4	24	4	24	And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.
6626	7	5	1	5	1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
6627	7	5	2	5	2	“When the princes take the lead in Israel, when the people volunteer, bless the LORD.
6628	7	5	3	5	3	Listen, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.
6629	7	5	4	5	4	O LORD, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the land of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens poured out rain, and the clouds poured down water.
6630	7	5	5	5	5	The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.
6631	7	5	6	5	6	In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted and the travelers took the byways.
6632	7	5	7	5	7	Life in the villages ceased; it ended in Israel, until I, Deborah, arose, a mother in Israel.
6633	7	5	8	5	8	When they chose new gods, then war came to their gates. Not a shield or spear was found among forty thousand in Israel.
6634	7	5	9	5	9	My heart is with the princes of Israel, with the volunteers among the people. Bless the LORD!
6635	7	5	10	5	10	You who ride white donkeys, who sit on saddle blankets, and you who travel the road, ponder
6636	7	5	11	5	11	the voices of the singers at the watering places. There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous deeds of His villagers in Israel. Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates:
6637	7	5	12	5	12	‘Awake, awake, O Deborah! Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, O Barak, and take hold of your captives, O son of Abinoam!’
6638	7	5	13	5	13	Then the survivors came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came down to me against the mighty.
6639	7	5	14	5	14	Some came from Ephraim, with their roots in Amalek; Benjamin came with your people after you. The commanders came down from Machir, the bearers of the marshal’s staff from Zebulun.
6640	7	5	15	5	15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar was with Barak, rushing into the valley at his heels. In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.
6641	7	5	16	5	16	Why did you sit among the sheepfolds to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.
6642	7	5	17	5	17	Gilead remained beyond the Jordan. Dan, why did you linger by the ships? Asher stayed at the coast and remained in his harbors.
6643	7	5	18	5	18	Zebulun was a people who risked their lives; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the battlefield.
6644	7	5	19	5	19	Kings came and fought; then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they took no plunder of silver.
6645	7	5	20	5	20	From the heavens the stars fought; from their courses they fought against Sisera.
6646	7	5	21	5	21	The River Kishon swept them away, the ancient river, the River Kishon. March on, O my soul, in strength!
6647	7	5	22	5	22	Then the hooves of horses thundered—the mad galloping of his stallions.
6648	7	5	23	5	23	‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the LORD. ‘Bitterly curse her inhabitants; for they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.’
6649	7	5	24	5	24	Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.
6650	7	5	25	5	25	He asked for water, and she gave him milk. In a magnificent bowl she brought him curds.
6651	7	5	26	5	26	She reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera and crushed his skull; she shattered and pierced his temple.
6652	7	5	27	5	27	At her feet he collapsed, he fell, there he lay still; at her feet he collapsed, he fell; where he collapsed, there he fell dead.
6653	7	5	28	5	28	Sisera’s mother looked through the window; she peered through the lattice and lamented: ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming? What has delayed the clatter of his chariots?’
6654	7	5	29	5	29	Her wisest ladies answer; indeed she keeps telling herself,
6655	7	5	30	5	30	‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil—a girl or two for each warrior, a plunder of dyed garments for Sisera, the spoil of embroidered garments for the neck of the looter?’
6656	7	5	31	5	31	So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may those who love You shine like the sun at its brightest.” And the land had rest for forty years.
6657	7	6	1	6	1	Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; so He delivered them into the hand of Midian for seven years,
6658	7	6	2	6	2	and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.
6659	7	6	3	6	3	Whenever the Israelites would plant their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east would come up and invade them,
6660	7	6	4	6	4	encamping against them as far as Gaza and destroying the produce of the land. They left Israel with no sustenance, neither sheep nor oxen nor donkeys.
6661	7	6	5	6	5	For the Midianites came with their livestock and their tents like a great swarm of locusts. They and their camels were innumerable, and they entered the land to ravage it.
6662	7	6	6	6	6	Israel was greatly impoverished by Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the LORD.
6663	7	6	7	6	7	Now when the Israelites cried out to the LORD because of Midian,
6664	7	6	8	6	8	He sent them a prophet, who told them, “This is what the LORD God of Israel says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
6665	7	6	9	6	9	I delivered you out of the hands of Egypt and all your oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land.
6666	7	6	10	6	10	And I said to you: ‘I am the LORD your God. You must not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.’ But you did not obey Me.”
6667	7	6	11	6	11	Then the angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
6668	7	6	12	6	12	And the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon and said, “The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.”
6669	7	6	13	6	13	“Please, my Lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all His wonders about which our fathers told us, saying, ‘Has not the LORD brought us up out of Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”
6670	7	6	14	6	14	The LORD turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Am I not sending you?”
6671	7	6	15	6	15	“Please, my Lord,” Gideon replied, “how can I save Israel? Indeed, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s house.”
6672	7	6	16	6	16	“Surely I will be with you,” the LORD replied, “and you will strike down all the Midianites as one man.”
6673	7	6	17	6	17	Gideon answered, “If I have found favor in Your sight, give me a sign that it is You speaking with me.
6674	7	6	18	6	18	Please do not depart from this place until I return to You. Let me bring my offering and set it before You.” And the LORD said, “I will stay until you return.”
6675	7	6	19	6	19	So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread and an ephah of flour. He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot and brought them out to present to Him under the oak.
6676	7	6	20	6	20	And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.
6677	7	6	21	6	21	Then the angel of the LORD extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. And fire flared from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
6678	7	6	22	6	22	When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he said, “Oh no, Lord GOD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!”
6679	7	6	23	6	23	But the LORD said to him, “Peace be with you. Do not be afraid, for you will not die.”
6680	7	6	24	6	24	So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
6681	7	6	25	6	25	On that very night the LORD said to Gideon, “Take your father’s young bull and a second bull seven years old, tear down your father’s altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
6682	7	6	26	6	26	Then build a proper altar to the LORD your God on the top of this stronghold. And with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down, take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering.”
6683	7	6	27	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his father’s household and the men of the city, he did it by night rather than in the daytime.
6684	7	6	28	6	28	When the men of the city got up in the morning, they found Baal’s altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it cut down, and the second bull offered up on the newly built altar.
6685	7	6	29	6	29	“Who did this?” they said to one another. And after they had investigated thoroughly, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”
6686	7	6	30	6	30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has torn down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”
6687	7	6	31	6	31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Are you contending for Baal? Are you trying to save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself if someone has torn down his altar.”
6688	7	6	32	6	32	So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend with him,” because he had torn down Baal’s altar.
6689	7	6	33	6	33	Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other people of the east gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
6690	7	6	34	6	34	So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, who blew the ram’s horn and rallied the Abiezrites behind him.
6691	7	6	35	6	35	Calling them to arms, Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh, as well as Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so that they came up to meet him.
6692	7	6	36	6	36	Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said,
6693	7	6	37	6	37	then behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that You are going to save Israel by my hand, as You have said.”
6694	7	6	38	6	38	And that is what happened. When Gideon arose the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.
6695	7	6	39	6	39	Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me one more test with the fleece. This time let it be dry, and the ground covered with dew.”
6696	7	6	40	6	40	And that night God did so. Only the fleece was dry, and dew covered the ground.
6697	7	7	1	7	1	Early in the morning Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the men with him camped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
6698	7	7	2	7	2	The LORD said to Gideon, “You have too many people for Me to deliver Midian into their hands, lest Israel glorify themselves over Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’
6699	7	7	3	7	3	Now, therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people: ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of them turned back, but ten thousand remained.
6700	7	7	4	7	4	Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go. But if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”
6701	7	7	5	7	5	So Gideon brought the people down to the water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.”
6702	7	7	6	7	6	And the number of those who lapped the water with their hands to their mouths was three hundred men; all the others knelt to drink.
6703	7	7	7	7	7	Then the LORD said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped the water I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hands. But all the others are to go home.”
6704	7	7	8	7	8	So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred men, who took charge of the provisions and rams’ horns of the others. And the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.
6705	7	7	9	7	9	That night the LORD said to Gideon, “Get up and go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hands.
6706	7	7	10	7	10	But if you are afraid to do so, then go down to the camp with your servant Purah
6707	7	7	11	7	11	and listen to what they are saying. Then your hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went with Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men were guarding the camp.
6708	7	7	12	7	12	Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the other people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were as countless as the sand on the seashore.
6709	7	7	13	7	13	And as Gideon arrived, a man was telling his friend about a dream. “Behold, I had a dream,” he said, “and I saw a loaf of barley bread come tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.”
6710	7	7	14	7	14	His friend replied: “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has delivered Midian and the whole camp into his hands.”
6711	7	7	15	7	15	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Get up, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hands.”
6712	7	7	16	7	16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies and gave each man a ram’s horn in one hand and a large jar in the other, containing a torch.
6713	7	7	17	7	17	“Watch me and do as I do,” Gideon said. “When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do exactly as I do.
6714	7	7	18	7	18	When I and all who are with me blow our horns, then you are also to blow your horns from all around the camp and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”
6715	7	7	19	7	19	Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after the changing of the guard. They blew their horns and broke the jars that were in their hands.
6716	7	7	20	7	20	The three companies blew their horns and shattered their jars. Holding the torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, they shouted, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!”
6717	7	7	21	7	21	Each Israelite took his position around the camp, and the entire Midianite army fled, crying out as they ran.
6718	7	7	22	7	22	And when the three hundred rams’ horns sounded, the LORD set the swords of every man in the camp against each other. The army fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
6719	7	7	23	7	23	Then the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and they pursued the Midianites.
6720	7	7	24	7	24	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim to say, “Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth-barah.” So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth-barah.
6721	7	7	25	7	25	They also captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. So they pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.
6722	7	8	1	8	1	Then the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you done this to us? Why did you fail to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him violently.
6723	7	8	2	8	2	But Gideon answered them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
6724	7	8	3	8	3	God has delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?” When he had said this, their anger against him subsided.
6725	7	8	4	8	4	Then Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan and crossed it, exhausted yet still in pursuit.
6726	7	8	5	8	5	So Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my troops some bread, for they are exhausted, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
6727	7	8	6	8	6	But the leaders of Succoth asked, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your army?”
6728	7	8	7	8	7	“Very well,” Gideon replied, “when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!”
6729	7	8	8	8	8	From there he went up to Penuel and asked the same from them, but the men of Penuel gave the same response as the men of Succoth.
6730	7	8	9	8	9	So Gideon told the men of Penuel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower!”
6731	7	8	10	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army of about fifteen thousand men—all that were left of the armies of the people of the east. A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen.
6732	7	8	11	8	11	And Gideon went up by way of the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their army, taking them by surprise.
6733	7	8	12	8	12	When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, Gideon pursued and captured these two kings of Midian, routing their entire army.
6734	7	8	13	8	13	After this, Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle along the Ascent of Heres.
6735	7	8	14	8	14	There he captured a young man of Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth.
6736	7	8	15	8	15	And Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your weary men?’”
6737	7	8	16	8	16	Then he took the elders of the city, and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness, he disciplined the men of Succoth.
6738	7	8	17	8	17	He also pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
6739	7	8	18	8	18	Next, Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” “Men like you,” they answered, “each one resembling the son of a king.”
6740	7	8	19	8	19	“They were my brothers,” Gideon replied, “the sons of my mother! As surely as the LORD lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.”
6741	7	8	20	8	20	So he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them.” But the young man did not draw his sword; he was fearful because he was still a youth.
6742	7	8	21	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and kill us yourself, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels.
6743	7	8	22	8	22	Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you and your son and grandson—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
6744	7	8	23	8	23	But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The LORD shall rule over you.”
6745	7	8	24	8	24	Then he added, “Let me make a request of you, that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.” (For the enemies had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
6746	7	8	25	8	25	“We will give them gladly,” they replied. So they spread out a garment, and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it.
6747	7	8	26	8	26	The weight of the gold earrings he had requested was 1,700 shekels, in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, the purple garments of the kings of Midian, and the chains from the necks of their camels.
6748	7	8	27	8	27	From all this Gideon made an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
6749	7	8	28	8	28	In this way Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. So the land had rest for forty years in the days of Gideon,
6750	7	8	29	8	29	and he—Jerubbaal son of Joash—returned home and settled down.
6751	7	8	30	8	30	Gideon had seventy sons of his own, since he had many wives.
6752	7	8	31	8	31	His concubine, who dwelt in Shechem, also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
6753	7	8	32	8	32	Later, Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
6754	7	8	33	8	33	And as soon as Gideon was dead, the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals, and they set up Baal-berith as their god.
6755	7	8	34	8	34	The Israelites failed to remember the LORD their God who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
6756	7	8	35	8	35	They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for Israel.
6757	7	9	1	9	1	Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his mother’s brothers at Shechem and said to them and to all the clan of his mother,
6758	7	9	2	9	2	“Please ask all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or just one man?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and blood.”
6759	7	9	3	9	3	And when his mother’s brothers spoke all these words about him in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem, their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”
6760	7	9	4	9	4	So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless men to follow him.
6761	7	9	5	9	5	He went to his father’s house in Ophrah, and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he hid himself.
6762	7	9	6	9	6	Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo gathered beside the oak at the pillar in Shechem and proceeded to make Abimelech their king.
6763	7	9	7	9	7	When this was reported to Jotham, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and cried out: “Listen to me, O leaders of Shechem, and may God listen to you.
6764	7	9	8	9	8	One day the trees set out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’
6765	7	9	9	9	9	But the olive tree replied, ‘Should I stop giving my oil that honors both God and man, to hold sway over the trees?’
6766	7	9	10	9	10	Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’
6767	7	9	11	9	11	But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I stop giving my sweetness and my good fruit, to hold sway over the trees?’
6768	7	9	12	9	12	Then the trees said to the grapevine, ‘Come and reign over us.’
6769	7	9	13	9	13	But the grapevine replied, ‘Should I stop giving my wine that cheers both God and man, to hold sway over the trees?’
6770	7	9	14	9	14	Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and reign over us.’
6771	7	9	15	9	15	But the thornbush replied, ‘If you really are anointing me as king over you, come and find refuge in my shade. But if not, may fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’
6772	7	9	16	9	16	Now if you have acted faithfully and honestly in making Abimelech king, if you have done well by Jerubbaal and his family, and if you have done to him as he deserves—
6773	7	9	17	9	17	for my father fought for you and risked his life to deliver you from the hand of Midian,
6774	7	9	18	9	18	but you have risen up against my father’s house this day and killed his seventy sons on a single stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your brother—
6775	7	9	19	9	19	if you have acted faithfully and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day, then may you rejoice in Abimelech, and he in you.
6776	7	9	20	9	20	But if not, may fire come from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.”
6777	7	9	21	9	21	Then Jotham ran away, escaping to Beer, and he lived there for fear of his brother Abimelech.
6778	7	9	22	9	22	After Abimelech had reigned over Israel for three years,
6779	7	9	23	9	23	God sent a spirit of animosity between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem and caused them to treat Abimelech deceitfully,
6780	7	9	24	9	24	in order that the crime against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood be avenged on their brother Abimelech and on the leaders of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.
6781	7	9	25	9	25	The leaders of Shechem set an ambush against Abimelech on the hilltops, and they robbed all who passed by them on the road. So this was reported to Abimelech.
6782	7	9	26	9	26	Meanwhile, Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him.
6783	7	9	27	9	27	And after they had gone out into the fields, gathered grapes from their vineyards, and trodden them, they held a festival and went into the house of their god; and as they ate and drank, they cursed Abimelech.
6784	7	9	28	9	28	Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve Abimelech?
6785	7	9	29	9	29	If only this people were under my authority, I would remove Abimelech; I would say to him, ‘Muster your army and come out!’”
6786	7	9	30	9	30	When Zebul the governor of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he burned with anger.
6787	7	9	31	9	31	So he covertly sent messengers to Abimelech to say, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.
6788	7	9	32	9	32	Now then, tonight you and the people with you are to come and lie in wait in the fields.
6789	7	9	33	9	33	And in the morning at sunrise, get up and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do to them whatever you are able.”
6790	7	9	34	9	34	So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
6791	7	9	35	9	35	Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelech and his men came out from their hiding places.
6792	7	9	36	9	36	When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountains!” But Zebul replied, “The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.”
6793	7	9	37	9	37	Then Gaal spoke up again, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming by way of the Diviners’ Oak.”
6794	7	9	38	9	38	“Where is your gloating now?” Zebul replied. “You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Are these not the people you ridiculed? Go out now and fight them!”
6795	7	9	39	9	39	So Gaal went out before the leaders of Shechem and fought against Abimelech,
6796	7	9	40	9	40	but Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled before him. And many Shechemites fell wounded all the way to the entrance of the gate.
6797	7	9	41	9	41	Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.
6798	7	9	42	9	42	The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.
6799	7	9	43	9	43	So he took his men, divided them into three companies, and waited in ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose up against them and attacked them.
6800	7	9	44	9	44	Then Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate. The other two companies rushed against all who were in the fields and struck them down.
6801	7	9	45	9	45	And all that day Abimelech fought against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.
6802	7	9	46	9	46	On hearing of this, all the leaders in the tower of Shechem entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith.
6803	7	9	47	9	47	And when Abimelech was told that all the leaders in the tower of Shechem were gathered there,
6804	7	9	48	9	48	he and all his men went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his axe in his hand and cut a branch from the trees, which he lifted to his shoulder, saying to his men, “Hurry and do what you have seen me do.”
6805	7	9	49	9	49	So each man also cut his own branch and followed Abimelech. Then they piled the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire above them, killing everyone in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women.
6806	7	9	50	9	50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez, encamped against it, and captured it.
6807	7	9	51	9	51	But there was a strong tower inside the city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof of the tower.
6808	7	9	52	9	52	When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he approached its entrance to set it on fire.
6809	7	9	53	9	53	But a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull.
6810	7	9	54	9	54	He quickly called his armor-bearer, saying, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran his sword through him, and he died.
6811	7	9	55	9	55	And when the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
6812	7	9	56	9	56	In this way God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father in murdering his seventy brothers.
6813	7	9	57	9	57	And God also brought all the wickedness of the men of Shechem back upon their own heads. So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came upon them.
6814	7	10	1	10	1	After the time of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose up to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
6815	7	10	2	10	2	Tola judged Israel twenty-three years, and when he died, he was buried in Shamir.
6816	7	10	3	10	3	Tola was followed by Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
6817	7	10	4	10	4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth-jair.
6818	7	10	5	10	5	When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
6819	7	10	6	10	6	And again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD. They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines. Thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him.
6820	7	10	7	10	7	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites,
6821	7	10	8	10	8	who that very year harassed and oppressed the Israelites, and did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.
6822	7	10	9	10	9	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, and Israel was in deep distress.
6823	7	10	10	10	10	Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have indeed forsaken our God and served the Baals.”
6824	7	10	11	10	11	The LORD replied, “When the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines,
6825	7	10	12	10	12	Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their hands?
6826	7	10	13	10	13	But you have forsaken Me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.
6827	7	10	14	10	14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you in your time of trouble.”
6828	7	10	15	10	15	“We have sinned,” the Israelites said to the LORD. “Deal with us as You see fit; but please deliver us today!”
6829	7	10	16	10	16	So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel.
6830	7	10	17	10	17	Then the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, and the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
6831	7	10	18	10	18	And the rulers of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all who live in Gilead.”
6832	7	11	1	11	1	Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his father.
6833	7	11	2	11	2	And Gilead’s wife bore him sons who grew up, drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.”
6834	7	11	3	11	3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where worthless men gathered around him and traveled with him.
6835	7	11	4	11	4	Some time later, when the Ammonites fought against Israel
6836	7	11	5	11	5	and made war with them, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
6837	7	11	6	11	6	“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so that we can fight against the Ammonites.”
6838	7	11	7	11	7	Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and expel me from my father’s house? So why then have you come to me now when you are in distress?”
6839	7	11	8	11	8	They answered Jephthah, “This is why we now turn to you, that you may go with us, fight the Ammonites, and become leader over all of us who live in Gilead.”
6840	7	11	9	11	9	But Jephthah asked them, “If you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, will I really be your leader?”
6841	7	11	10	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD is our witness if we do not do as you say.”
6842	7	11	11	11	11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah.
6843	7	11	12	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What do you have against me that you have come to fight against my land?”
6844	7	11	13	11	13	The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they seized my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan. Now, therefore, restore it peaceably.”
6845	7	11	14	11	14	Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites
6846	7	11	15	11	15	to tell him, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or of the Ammonites.
6847	7	11	16	11	16	But when Israel came up out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
6848	7	11	17	11	17	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
6849	7	11	18	11	18	Then Israel traveled through the wilderness and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, since the Arnon was its border.
6850	7	11	19	11	19	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land into our own place.’
6851	7	11	20	11	20	But Sihon would not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So he gathered all his people, encamped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
6852	7	11	21	11	21	Then the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hands of Israel, who defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites who inhabited that country,
6853	7	11	22	11	22	seizing all the land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
6854	7	11	23	11	23	Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel, should you now possess it?
6855	7	11	24	11	24	Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh grants you? So also, we possess whatever the LORD our God has granted us.
6856	7	11	25	11	25	Are you now so much better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them?
6857	7	11	26	11	26	For three hundred years Israel has lived in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, as well as all the cities along the banks of the Arnon. Why did you not take them back during that time?
6858	7	11	27	11	27	I have not sinned against you, but you have done me wrong by waging war against me. May the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”
6859	7	11	28	11	28	But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to the message Jephthah sent him.
6860	7	11	29	11	29	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through Mizpah of Gilead. And from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
6861	7	11	30	11	30	Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: “If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hands,
6862	7	11	31	11	31	then whatever comes out of the door of my house to greet me on my triumphant return from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”
6863	7	11	32	11	32	So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
6864	7	11	33	11	33	With a great blow he devastated twenty cities from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.
6865	7	11	34	11	34	And when Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and dancing! She was his only child; he had no son or daughter besides her.
6866	7	11	35	11	35	As soon as Jephthah saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “No! Not my daughter! You have brought me to my knees! You have brought great misery upon me, for I have given my word to the LORD and cannot take it back.”
6867	7	11	36	11	36	“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me as you have said, for the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.”
6868	7	11	37	11	37	She also said to her father, “Let me do this one thing: Let me wander for two months through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity.”
6869	7	11	38	11	38	“Go,” he said. And he sent her away for two months. So she left with her friends and mourned her virginity upon the mountains.
6870	7	11	39	11	39	After two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never had relations with a man. So it has become a custom in Israel
6871	7	11	40	11	40	that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
6872	7	12	1	12	1	Then the men of Ephraim assembled and crossed the Jordan to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why have you crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down with you inside!”
6873	7	12	2	12	2	But Jephthah replied, “My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called, you did not save me out of their hands.
6874	7	12	3	12	3	When I saw that you would not save me, I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come today to fight against me?”
6875	7	12	4	12	4	Jephthah then gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are fugitives in Ephraim, living in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.”
6876	7	12	5	12	5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he answered, “No,”
6877	7	12	6	12	6	they told him, “Please say Shibboleth.” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.
6878	7	12	7	12	7	Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
6879	7	12	8	12	8	After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
6880	7	12	9	12	9	He had thirty sons, as well as thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage to men outside his clan; and for his sons he brought back thirty wives from elsewhere. Ibzan judged Israel seven years.
6881	7	12	10	12	10	Then Ibzan died, and he was buried in Bethlehem.
6882	7	12	11	12	11	After Ibzan, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel ten years.
6883	7	12	12	12	12	Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
6884	7	12	13	12	13	After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel.
6885	7	12	14	12	14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years.
6886	7	12	15	12	15	Then Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, died, and he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
6887	7	13	1	13	1	Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
6888	7	13	2	13	2	Now there was a man from Zorah named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had no children.
6889	7	13	3	13	3	The angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you will conceive and give birth to a son.
6890	7	13	4	13	4	Now please be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean.
6891	7	13	5	13	5	For behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall come over his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
6892	7	13	6	13	6	So the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
6893	7	13	7	13	7	But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’”
6894	7	13	8	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.”
6895	7	13	9	13	9	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
6896	7	13	10	13	10	The woman ran quickly to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!”
6897	7	13	11	13	11	So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” “I am,” he said.
6898	7	13	12	13	12	Then Manoah asked, “When your words come to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?”
6899	7	13	13	13	13	So the angel of the LORD answered Manoah, “Your wife is to do everything I told her.
6900	7	13	14	13	14	She must not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
6901	7	13	15	13	15	“Please stay here,” Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.”
6902	7	13	16	13	16	And the angel of the LORD replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD.
6903	7	13	17	13	17	Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes to pass?”
6904	7	13	18	13	18	“Why do you ask my name,” said the angel of the LORD, “since it is beyond comprehension?”
6905	7	13	19	13	19	Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife looked on, the LORD did a marvelous thing.
6906	7	13	20	13	20	When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground.
6907	7	13	21	13	21	And when the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it had been the angel of the LORD.
6908	7	13	22	13	22	“We are going to die,” he said to his wife, “for we have seen God!”
6909	7	13	23	13	23	But his wife replied, “If the LORD had intended to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things or spoken to us this way.”
6910	7	13	24	13	24	So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.
6911	7	13	25	13	25	And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
6912	7	14	1	14	1	One day Samson went down to Timnah, where he saw a young Philistine woman.
6913	7	14	2	14	2	So he returned and told his father and his mother, “I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah. Now get her for me as a wife.”
6914	7	14	3	14	3	But his father and mother replied, “Can’t you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?” But Samson told his father, “Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.”
6915	7	14	4	14	4	(Now his father and mother did not know this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.)
6916	7	14	5	14	5	Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him,
6917	7	14	6	14	6	and the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
6918	7	14	7	14	7	Then Samson continued on his way down and spoke to the woman, because she was pleasing to his eyes.
6919	7	14	8	14	8	When Samson returned later to take her, he left the road to see the lion’s carcass, and in it was a swarm of bees, along with their honey.
6920	7	14	9	14	9	So he scooped some honey into his hands and ate it as he went along. When he returned to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass.
6921	7	14	10	14	10	Then his father went to visit the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, as was customary for the bridegroom.
6922	7	14	11	14	11	And when the Philistines saw him, they selected thirty men to accompany him.
6923	7	14	12	14	12	“Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson said to them. “If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
6924	7	14	13	14	13	But if you cannot solve it, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.” “Tell us your riddle,” they replied. “Let us hear it.”
6925	7	14	14	14	14	So he said to them: “Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.” For three days they were unable to explain the riddle.
6926	7	14	15	14	15	So on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?”
6927	7	14	16	14	16	Then Samson’s wife came to him, weeping, and said, “You hate me! You do not really love me! You have posed to my people a riddle, but have not explained it to me.” “Look,” he said, “I have not even explained it to my father or mother, so why should I explain it to you?”
6928	7	14	17	14	17	She wept the whole seven days of the feast, and finally on the seventh day, because she had pressed him so much, he told her the answer. And in turn she explained the riddle to her people.
6929	7	14	18	14	18	Before sunset on the seventh day, the men of the city said to Samson: “What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?” So he said to them: “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle!”
6930	7	14	19	14	19	Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave their clothes to those who had solved the riddle. And burning with anger, Samson returned to his father’s house,
6931	7	14	20	14	20	and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied him.
6932	7	15	1	15	1	Later on, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. “I want to go to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter.
6933	7	15	2	15	2	“I was sure that you thoroughly hated her,” said her father, “so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.”
6934	7	15	3	15	3	Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in doing harm to the Philistines.”
6935	7	15	4	15	4	Then Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. And he took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and fastened a torch between each pair of tails.
6936	7	15	5	15	5	Then he lit the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
6937	7	15	6	15	6	“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded. “It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,” they were told. “For his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
6938	7	15	7	15	7	And Samson told them, “Because you have done this, I will not rest until I have taken vengeance upon you.”
6939	7	15	8	15	8	And he struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter, and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam.
6940	7	15	9	15	9	Then the Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and deployed themselves against Lehi.
6941	7	15	10	15	10	“Why have you attacked us?” said the men of Judah. The Philistines replied, “We have come to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he has done to us.”
6942	7	15	11	15	11	In response, three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Do you not realize that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” “I have done to them what they did to me,” he replied.
6943	7	15	12	15	12	But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson replied, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
6944	7	15	13	15	13	“No,” they answered, “we will not kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
6945	7	15	14	15	14	When Samson arrived in Lehi, the Philistines came out shouting against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him. The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax, and the bonds broke loose from his hands.
6946	7	15	15	15	15	He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck down a thousand men.
6947	7	15	16	15	16	Then Samson said: “With the jawbone of a donkey I have piled them into heaps. With the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men.”
6948	7	15	17	15	17	And when Samson had finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi.
6949	7	15	18	15	18	And being very thirsty, Samson cried out to the LORD, “You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
6950	7	15	19	15	19	So God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore, and it remains in Lehi to this day.
6951	7	15	20	15	20	And Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
6952	7	16	1	16	1	One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went in to spend the night with her.
6953	7	16	2	16	2	When the Gazites heard that Samson was there, they surrounded that place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They were quiet throughout the night, saying, “Let us wait until dawn; then we will kill him.”
6954	7	16	3	16	3	But Samson lay there only until midnight, when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and both gateposts, and pulled them out bar and all. Then he put them on his shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking Hebron.
6955	7	16	4	16	4	Some time later, Samson fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
6956	7	16	5	16	5	The lords of the Philistines went to her and said, “Entice him and find out the source of his great strength and how we can overpower him to tie him up and subdue him. Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.”
6957	7	16	6	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me the source of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.”
6958	7	16	7	16	7	Samson told her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become as weak as any other man.”
6959	7	16	8	16	8	So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them.
6960	7	16	9	16	9	While the men were hidden in her room, she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But he snapped the bowstrings like a strand of yarn seared by a flame. So the source of his strength remained unknown.
6961	7	16	10	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me! Now please tell me how you can be tied up.”
6962	7	16	11	16	11	He replied, “If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used, I will become as weak as any other man.”
6963	7	16	12	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them, and called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But while the men were hidden in her room, he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
6964	7	16	13	16	13	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and lied to me all along! Tell me how you can be tied up.” He told her, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the web of a loom and tighten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.”
6965	7	16	14	16	14	So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web. Then she tightened it with a pin and called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin with the loom and the web.
6966	7	16	15	16	15	“How can you say, ‘I love you,’” she told him, “when your heart is not with me? This is the third time you have mocked me and failed to reveal to me the source of your great strength!”
6967	7	16	16	16	16	Finally, after she had pressed him daily with her words and pleaded until he was sick to death,
6968	7	16	17	16	17	Samson told her all that was in his heart: “My hair has never been cut, because I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become as weak as any other man.”
6969	7	16	18	16	18	When Delilah realized that he had revealed to her all that was in his heart, she sent this message to the lords of the Philistines: “Come up once more, for he has revealed to me all that is in his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came to her, bringing the money in their hands.
6970	7	16	19	16	19	And having lulled him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his head. In this way she began to subdue him, and his strength left him.
6971	7	16	20	16	20	Then she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” When Samson awoke from his sleep, he thought, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him.
6972	7	16	21	16	21	Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, where he was bound with bronze shackles and forced to grind grain in the prison.
6973	7	16	22	16	22	However, the hair of his head began to grow back after it had been shaved.
6974	7	16	23	16	23	Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced and said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.”
6975	7	16	24	16	24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god, saying: “Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy who destroyed our land and multiplied our dead.”
6976	7	16	25	16	25	And while their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them. And they stationed him between the pillars.
6977	7	16	26	16	26	Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple, so I can lean against them.”
6978	7	16	27	16	27	Now the temple was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain them.
6979	7	16	28	16	28	Then Samson called out to the LORD: “O Lord GOD, please remember me. Strengthen me, O God, just once more, so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes.”
6980	7	16	29	16	29	And Samson reached out for the two central pillars supporting the temple. Bracing himself against them with his right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other,
6981	7	16	30	16	30	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” Then he pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the lords and all the people in it. So in his death he killed more than he had killed in his life.
6982	7	16	31	16	31	Then Samson’s brothers and his father’s family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. And he had judged Israel twenty years.
6983	7	17	1	17	1	Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
6984	7	17	2	17	2	said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have the silver here with me; I took it.” Then his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the LORD!”
6985	7	17	3	17	3	And when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD for my son’s benefit to make a graven image and a molten idol. Therefore I will now return it to you.”
6986	7	17	4	17	4	So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a graven image and a molten idol. And they were placed in the house of Micah.
6987	7	17	5	17	5	Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household idols, and ordained one of his sons as his priest.
6988	7	17	6	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
6989	7	17	7	17	7	And there was a young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who had been residing within the clan of Judah.
6990	7	17	8	17	8	This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to settle where he could find a place. And as he traveled, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.
6991	7	17	9	17	9	“Where are you from?” Micah asked him. “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he replied, “and I am on my way to settle wherever I can find a place.”
6992	7	17	10	17	10	“Stay with me,” Micah said to him, “and be my father and priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your provisions.” So the Levite went in
6993	7	17	11	17	11	and agreed to stay with him, and the young man became like a son to Micah.
6994	7	17	12	17	12	Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.
6995	7	17	13	17	13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest.”
6996	7	18	1	18	1	In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory to occupy. For up to that time they had not come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
6997	7	18	2	18	2	So the Danites sent out five men from their clans, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore it. “Go and explore the land,” they told them. The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.
6998	7	18	3	18	3	And while they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”
6999	7	18	4	18	4	“Micah has done this and that for me,” he replied, “and he has hired me to be his priest.”
7000	7	18	5	18	5	Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to determine whether we will have a successful journey.”
7001	7	18	6	18	6	And the priest told them, “Go in peace. The LORD is watching over your journey.”
7002	7	18	7	18	7	So the five men departed and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living securely, like the Sidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking in the land and no oppressive ruler. And they were far away from the Sidonians and had no alliance with anyone.
7003	7	18	8	18	8	When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, “What did you find?”
7004	7	18	9	18	9	They answered, “Come on, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why would you fail to act? Do not hesitate to go there and take possession of the land!
7005	7	18	10	18	10	When you enter, you will come to an unsuspecting people and a spacious land, for God has given it into your hands. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking.”
7006	7	18	11	18	11	So six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war.
7007	7	18	12	18	12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim is called Mahaneh-dan to this day.
7008	7	18	13	18	13	And from there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.
7009	7	18	14	18	14	Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Did you know that one of these houses has an ephod, household gods, a graven image, and a molten idol? Now think about what you should do.”
7010	7	18	15	18	15	So they turned aside there and went to the home of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and greeted him.
7011	7	18	16	18	16	The six hundred Danites stood at the entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war.
7012	7	18	17	18	17	And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, while the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred armed men.
7013	7	18	18	18	18	When they entered Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
7014	7	18	19	18	19	“Be quiet,” they told him. “Put your hand over your mouth and come with us and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person or a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?”
7015	7	18	20	18	20	So the priest was glad and took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image, and went with the people.
7016	7	18	21	18	21	Putting their small children, their livestock, and their possessions in front of them, they turned and departed.
7017	7	18	22	18	22	After they were some distance from Micah’s house, the men in the houses near Micah’s house mobilized and overtook the Danites.
7018	7	18	23	18	23	When they called out after them, the Danites turned to face them and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you that you have called out such a company?”
7019	7	18	24	18	24	He replied, “You took the gods I had made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”
7020	7	18	25	18	25	The Danites said to him, “Do not raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.”
7021	7	18	26	18	26	So the Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were too strong for him.
7022	7	18	27	18	27	After they had taken Micah’s idols and his priest, they went to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting people, and they struck them with their swords and burned down the city.
7023	7	18	28	18	28	There was no one to deliver them, because the city was far from Sidon and had no alliance with anyone; it was in a valley near Beth-rehob. And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there.
7024	7	18	29	18	29	They named it Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel—though the city was formerly named Laish.
7025	7	18	30	18	30	The Danites set up idols for themselves, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
7026	7	18	31	18	31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image, and it was there the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh.
7027	7	19	1	19	1	And in those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
7028	7	19	2	19	2	But she was unfaithful to him and left him to return to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. After she had been there four months,
7029	7	19	3	19	3	her husband got up and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring her back, taking his servant and a pair of donkeys. So the girl brought him into her father’s house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.
7030	7	19	4	19	4	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, persuaded him to stay, so he remained with him three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there.
7031	7	19	5	19	5	On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning and prepared to depart, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and then you can go.”
7032	7	19	6	19	6	So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Please agree to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.”
7033	7	19	7	19	7	The man got up to depart, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.
7034	7	19	8	19	8	On the fifth day, he got up early in the morning to depart, but the girl’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they waited until late afternoon and the two of them ate.
7035	7	19	9	19	9	When the man got up to depart with his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is drawing to a close. Please spend the night. See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, that your heart may be merry. Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey home.”
7036	7	19	10	19	10	But the man was unwilling to spend the night. He got up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
7037	7	19	11	19	11	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, “Please, let us stop at this Jebusite city and spend the night here.”
7038	7	19	12	19	12	But his master replied, “We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners, where there are no Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.”
7039	7	19	13	19	13	He continued, “Come, let us try to reach one of these towns to spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.”
7040	7	19	14	19	14	So they continued on their journey, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
7041	7	19	15	19	15	They stopped to go in and lodge in Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city square, but no one would take them into his home for the night.
7042	7	19	16	19	16	That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was residing in Gibeah (the men of that place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the field.
7043	7	19	17	19	17	When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where have you come from?”
7044	7	19	18	19	18	The Levite replied, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the house of the LORD; but no one has taken me into his home,
7045	7	19	19	19	19	even though there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me and the maidservant and young man with me. There is nothing that we, your servants, lack.”
7046	7	19	20	19	20	“Peace to you,” said the old man. “Let me supply everything you need. Only do not spend the night in the square.”
7047	7	19	21	19	21	So he brought him to his house and fed his donkeys. And they washed their feet and ate and drank.
7048	7	19	22	19	22	While they were enjoying themselves, suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they said to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have relations with him!”
7049	7	19	23	19	23	The owner of the house went out and said to them, “No, my brothers, do not do this wicked thing! After all, this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this outrage.
7050	7	19	24	19	24	Look, let me bring out my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine, and you can use them and do with them as you wish. But do not do such a vile thing to this man.”
7051	7	19	25	19	25	But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.
7052	7	19	26	19	26	Early that morning, the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, collapsed at the doorway, and lay there until it was light.
7053	7	19	27	19	27	In the morning, when her master got up and opened the doors of the house to go out on his journey, there was his concubine, collapsed in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
7054	7	19	28	19	28	“Get up,” he told her. “Let us go.” But there was no response. So the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
7055	7	19	29	19	29	When he reached his house, he picked up a knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel.
7056	7	19	30	19	30	And everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has been seen or done from the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt until this day. Think it over, take counsel, and speak up!”
7057	7	20	1	20	1	Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man before the LORD at Mizpah.
7058	7	20	2	20	2	The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people: 400,000 men on foot, armed with swords.
7059	7	20	3	20	3	(Meanwhile the Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites asked, “Tell us, how did this wicked thing happen?”
7060	7	20	4	20	4	So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
7061	7	20	5	20	5	And during the night, the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house. They intended to kill me, but they abused my concubine, and she died.
7062	7	20	6	20	6	Then I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
7063	7	20	7	20	7	Behold, all you Israelites, give your advice and verdict here and now.”
7064	7	20	8	20	8	Then all the people stood as one man and said, “Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house.
7065	7	20	9	20	9	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will go against it as the lot dictates.
7066	7	20	10	20	10	We will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to supply provisions for the army when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin to punish them for the atrocity they have committed in Israel.”
7067	7	20	11	20	11	So all the men of Israel gathered as one man, united against the city.
7068	7	20	12	20	12	And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you?
7069	7	20	13	20	13	Hand over the wicked men of Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge Israel of this evil.” But the Benjamites refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites.
7070	7	20	14	20	14	And from their cities they came together at Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites.
7071	7	20	15	20	15	On that day the Benjamites mobilized 26,000 swordsmen from their cities, in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah.
7072	7	20	16	20	16	Among all these soldiers there were 700 select left-handers, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair without missing.
7073	7	20	17	20	17	The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 swordsmen, each one an experienced warrior.
7074	7	20	18	20	18	The Israelites set out, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, “Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” “Judah will be first,” the LORD replied.
7075	7	20	19	20	19	The next morning the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah.
7076	7	20	20	20	20	And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took up their battle positions at Gibeah.
7077	7	20	21	20	21	And the Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.
7078	7	20	22	20	22	But the Israelite army took courage and again took their battle positions in the same place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day.
7079	7	20	23	20	23	They went up and wept before the LORD until evening, inquiring of Him, “Should we again draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?” And the LORD answered, “Go up against them.”
7080	7	20	24	20	24	On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjamites.
7081	7	20	25	20	25	That same day the Benjamites came out against them from Gibeah and cut down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
7082	7	20	26	20	26	Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, where they sat weeping before the LORD. That day they fasted until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD.
7083	7	20	27	20	27	And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,
7084	7	20	28	20	28	and Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it.) The Israelites asked, “Should we again go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites, or should we stop?” The LORD answered, “Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.”
7085	7	20	29	20	29	So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah.
7086	7	20	30	20	30	On the third day the Israelites went up against the Benjamites and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as they had done before.
7087	7	20	31	20	31	The Benjamites came out against them and were drawn away from the city. They began to attack the people as before, killing about thirty men of Israel in the fields and on the roads, one of which led up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.
7088	7	20	32	20	32	“We are defeating them as before,” said the Benjamites. But the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city onto the roads.”
7089	7	20	33	20	33	So all the men of Israel got up from their places and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions west of Gibeah.
7090	7	20	34	20	34	Then 10,000 select men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not realize that disaster was upon them.
7091	7	20	35	20	35	The LORD defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
7092	7	20	36	20	36	Then the Benjamites realized they had been defeated. Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah.
7093	7	20	37	20	37	The men in ambush rushed suddenly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword.
7094	7	20	38	20	38	The men of Israel had arranged a signal with the men in ambush: When they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city,
7095	7	20	39	20	39	the men of Israel would turn in the battle. When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They are defeated before us as in the first battle.”
7096	7	20	40	20	40	But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke.
7097	7	20	41	20	41	Then the men of Israel turned back on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had come upon them.
7098	7	20	42	20	42	So they fled before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and the men coming out of the cities struck them down there.
7099	7	20	43	20	43	They surrounded the Benjamites, pursued them, and easily overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
7100	7	20	44	20	44	And 18,000 Benjamites fell, all men of valor.
7101	7	20	45	20	45	Then the Benjamites turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads. And they overtook them at Gidom and struck down 2,000 more.
7102	7	20	46	20	46	That day 25,000 Benjamite swordsmen fell, all men of valor.
7103	7	20	47	20	47	But six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.
7104	7	20	48	20	48	And the men of Israel turned back against the other Benjamites and struck down with the sword all the cities, including the animals and everything else they found. And they burned down all the cities in their path.
7105	7	21	1	21	1	Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”
7106	7	21	2	21	2	So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, lifting up their voices and weeping bitterly.
7107	7	21	3	21	3	“Why, O LORD God of Israel,” they cried out, “has this happened in Israel? Today in Israel one tribe is missing!”
7108	7	21	4	21	4	The next day the people got up early, built an altar there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings.
7109	7	21	5	21	5	The Israelites asked, “Who among all the tribes of Israel did not come to the assembly before the LORD?” For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah would surely be put to death.
7110	7	21	6	21	6	And the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites, and said, “Today a tribe is cut off from Israel.
7111	7	21	7	21	7	What should we do about wives for the survivors, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters in marriage?”
7112	7	21	8	21	8	So they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah?” And in fact, no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
7113	7	21	9	21	9	For when the people were counted, none of the residents of Jabesh-gilead were there.
7114	7	21	10	21	10	So the congregation sent 12,000 of their most valiant men and commanded them: “Go and put to the sword those living in Jabesh-gilead, including women and children.
7115	7	21	11	21	11	This is what you are to do: Devote to destruction every male, as well as every female who has had relations with a man.”
7116	7	21	12	21	12	So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young women who had not had relations with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
7117	7	21	13	21	13	Then the whole congregation sent a message of peace to the Benjamites who were at the rock of Rimmon.
7118	7	21	14	21	14	And at that time the Benjamites returned and were given the women who were spared from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough women for all of them.
7119	7	21	15	21	15	The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel.
7120	7	21	16	21	16	Then the elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”
7121	7	21	17	21	17	They added, “There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
7122	7	21	18	21	18	But we cannot give them our daughters as wives.” For the Israelites had sworn, “Cursed is he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.”
7123	7	21	19	21	19	“But look,” they said, “there is a yearly feast to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”
7124	7	21	20	21	20	So they commanded the Benjamites: “Go, hide in the vineyards
7125	7	21	21	21	21	and watch. When you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, each of you is to come out of the vineyards, catch for himself a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
7126	7	21	22	21	22	When their fathers or brothers come to us to complain, we will tell them, ‘Do us a favor by helping them, since we did not get wives for each of them in the war. Since you did not actually give them your daughters, you have no guilt.’”
7127	7	21	23	21	23	The Benjamites did as instructed and carried away the number of women they needed from the dancers they caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their cities, and settled in them.
7128	7	21	24	21	24	And at that time, each of the Israelites returned from there to his own tribe and clan, each to his own inheritance.
7129	7	21	25	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
7130	8	1	1	1	1	Now there was a man named Elkanah who was from Ramathaim-zophim in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
7131	8	1	2	1	2	He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
7132	8	1	3	1	3	Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the LORD.
7133	8	1	4	1	4	And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
7134	8	1	5	1	5	But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved her even though the LORD had closed her womb.
7135	8	1	6	1	6	Because the LORD had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her and taunt her viciously.
7136	8	1	7	1	7	And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat.
7137	8	1	8	1	8	“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
7138	8	1	9	1	9	So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.
7139	8	1	10	1	10	In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to the LORD and wept with many tears.
7140	8	1	11	1	11	And she made a vow, pleading, “O LORD of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever come over his head.”
7141	8	1	12	1	12	As Hannah kept on praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth.
7142	8	1	13	1	13	Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk
7143	8	1	14	1	14	and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!”
7144	8	1	15	1	15	“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have not had any wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.
7145	8	1	16	1	16	Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.”
7146	8	1	17	1	17	“Go in peace,” Eli replied, “and may the God of Israel grant the petition you have asked of Him.”
7147	8	1	18	1	18	“May your maidservant find favor with you,” said Hannah. Then she went on her way, and she began eating again, and her face was no longer downcast.
7148	8	1	19	1	19	The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to bow in worship before the LORD, and then returned home to Ramah. And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.
7149	8	1	20	1	20	So in the course of time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.”
7150	8	1	21	1	21	Then Elkanah and all his house went up to make the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,
7151	8	1	22	1	22	but Hannah did not go. “After the boy is weaned,” she said to her husband, “I will take him to appear before the LORD and to stay there always.”
7152	8	1	23	1	23	“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah replied, “and stay here until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD confirm His word.” So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
7153	8	1	24	1	24	Once she had weaned him, Hannah took the boy with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. Though the boy was still young, she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.
7154	8	1	25	1	25	And when they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli.
7155	8	1	26	1	26	“Please, my lord,” said Hannah, “as surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.
7156	8	1	27	1	27	I prayed for this boy, and since the LORD has granted me what I asked of Him,
7157	8	1	28	1	28	I now dedicate the boy to the LORD. For as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the LORD.” So they worshiped the LORD there.
7158	8	2	1	2	1	At that time Hannah prayed: “My heart rejoices in the LORD in whom my horn is exalted. My mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, for I rejoice in Your salvation.
7159	8	2	2	2	2	There is no one holy like the LORD. Indeed, there is no one besides You! And there is no Rock like our God.
7160	8	2	3	2	3	Do not boast so proudly, or let arrogance come from your mouth, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by Him actions are weighed.
7161	8	2	4	2	4	The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble are equipped with strength.
7162	8	2	5	2	5	The well-fed hire themselves out for food, but the starving hunger no more. The barren woman gives birth to seven, but she who has many sons pines away.
7163	8	2	6	2	6	The LORD brings death and gives life; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.
7164	8	2	7	2	7	The LORD sends poverty and wealth; He humbles and He exalts.
7165	8	2	8	2	8	He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap. He seats them among princes and bestows on them a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are the LORD’s, and upon them He has set the world.
7166	8	2	9	2	9	He guards the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked perish in darkness; for by his own strength shall no man prevail.
7167	8	2	10	2	10	Those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder from heaven against them. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth and will give power to His king. He will exalt the horn of His anointed.”
7168	8	2	11	2	11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy began ministering to the LORD before Eli the priest.
7169	8	2	12	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD
7170	8	2	13	2	13	or for the custom of the priests with the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling
7171	8	2	14	2	14	and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
7172	8	2	15	2	15	Even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
7173	8	2	16	2	16	And if any man said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you may take whatever you want,” the servant would reply, “No, you must give it to me right now. If you refuse, I will take it by force!”
7174	8	2	17	2	17	Thus the sin of these young men was severe in the sight of the LORD, for they were treating the LORD’s offering with contempt.
7175	8	2	18	2	18	Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD—a boy wearing a linen ephod.
7176	8	2	19	2	19	Each year his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
7177	8	2	20	2	20	And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” Then they would go home.
7178	8	2	21	2	21	So the LORD attended to Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
7179	8	2	22	2	22	Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
7180	8	2	23	2	23	“Why are you doing these things?” Eli said to his sons. “I hear about your wicked deeds from all these people.
7181	8	2	24	2	24	No, my sons; it is not a good report I hear circulating among the LORD’s people.
7182	8	2	25	2	25	If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to their father, since the LORD intended to put them to death.
7183	8	2	26	2	26	And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with man.
7184	8	2	27	2	27	Then a man of God came to Eli and told him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal Myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh’s house?
7185	8	2	28	2	28	And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected your father to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.
7186	8	2	29	2	29	Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and offering that I have prescribed for My dwelling place? You have honored your sons more than Me by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of My people Israel.’
7187	8	2	30	2	30	Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever. But now the LORD declares: Far be it from Me! For I will honor those who honor Me, but those who despise Me will be disdained.
7188	8	2	31	2	31	Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no older man will be left in your house.
7189	8	2	32	2	32	You will see distress in My dwelling place. Despite all that is good in Israel, no one in your house will ever again reach old age.
7190	8	2	33	2	33	And every one of you that I do not cut off from My altar, your eyes will fail and your heart will grieve. All your descendants will die by the sword of men.
7191	8	2	34	2	34	And this sign shall come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: They will both die on the same day.
7192	8	2	35	2	35	Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. And I will build for him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed one for all time.
7193	8	2	36	2	36	And everyone left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread, pleading, “Please appoint me to some priestly office so that I can eat a piece of bread.”’”
7194	8	3	1	3	1	And the boy Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. Now in those days the word of the LORD was rare and visions were scarce.
7195	8	3	2	3	2	And at that time Eli, whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see, was lying in his room.
7196	8	3	3	3	3	Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was located.
7197	8	3	4	3	4	Then the LORD called to Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.”
7198	8	3	5	3	5	He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” “I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
7199	8	3	6	3	6	Once again the LORD called, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” “My son, I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.”
7200	8	3	7	3	7	Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
7201	8	3	8	3	8	Once again, for the third time, the LORD called to Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy.
7202	8	3	9	3	9	“Go and lie down,” he said to Samuel, “and if He calls you, say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
7203	8	3	10	3	10	Then the LORD came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”
7204	8	3	11	3	11	Then the LORD said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel at which the ears of all who hear it will tingle.
7205	8	3	12	3	12	On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken about his family, from beginning to end.
7206	8	3	13	3	13	I told him that I would judge his house forever for the iniquity of which he knows, because his sons blasphemed God and he did not restrain them.
7207	8	3	14	3	14	Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, ‘The iniquity of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’”
7208	8	3	15	3	15	Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the LORD’s house. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
7209	8	3	16	3	16	but Eli called to him and said, “Samuel, my son.” “Here I am,” answered Samuel.
7210	8	3	17	3	17	“What was the message He gave you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God punish you, and ever so severely, if you hide from me anything He said to you.”
7211	8	3	18	3	18	So Samuel told him everything and did not hide a thing from him. “He is the LORD,” replied Eli. “Let Him do what is good in His eyes.”
7212	8	3	19	3	19	And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and He let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.
7213	8	3	20	3	20	So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.
7214	8	3	21	3	21	And the LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word.
7215	8	4	1	4	1	Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
7216	8	4	2	4	2	The Philistines arrayed themselves against Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield.
7217	8	4	3	4	3	When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has the LORD brought defeat on us before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.”
7218	8	4	4	4	4	So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
7219	8	4	5	4	5	When the ark of the covenant of the LORD entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a great shout that it shook the ground.
7220	8	4	6	4	6	On hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines asked, “What is this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” And when they realized that the ark of the LORD had entered the camp,
7221	8	4	7	4	7	the Philistines were afraid. “The gods have entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before.
7222	8	4	8	4	8	Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
7223	8	4	9	4	9	Take courage and be men, O Philistines! Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!”
7224	8	4	10	4	10	So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
7225	8	4	11	4	11	The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
7226	8	4	12	4	12	That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line all the way to Shiloh, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.
7227	8	4	13	4	13	When he arrived, there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching, because his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man entered the city to give a report, the whole city cried out.
7228	8	4	14	4	14	Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” So the man hurried over and reported to Eli.
7229	8	4	15	4	15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his gaze was fixed because he could not see.
7230	8	4	16	4	16	“I have just come from the battle,” the man said to Eli. “I fled from there today.” “What happened, my son?” Eli asked.
7231	8	4	17	4	17	The messenger answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
7232	8	4	18	4	18	As soon as the ark of God was mentioned, Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate, and being old and heavy, he broke his neck and died. And Eli had judged Israel forty years.
7233	8	4	19	4	19	Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news of the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth, for her labor pains overtook her.
7234	8	4	20	4	20	As she was dying, the women attending to her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!” But she did not respond or pay any heed.
7235	8	4	21	4	21	And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband had been killed.
7236	8	4	22	4	22	“The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “for the ark of God has been captured.”
7237	8	5	1	5	1	After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod,
7238	8	5	2	5	2	carried it into the temple of Dagon, and set it beside his statue.
7239	8	5	3	5	3	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.
7240	8	5	4	5	4	But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD, with his head and his hands broken off and lying on the threshold. Only the torso remained.
7241	8	5	5	5	5	That is why, to this day, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on the threshold.
7242	8	5	6	5	6	Now the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity, ravaging them and afflicting them with tumors.
7243	8	5	7	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon our god Dagon.”
7244	8	5	8	5	8	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” “It must be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they carried away the ark of the God of Israel.
7245	8	5	9	5	9	But after they had moved the ark to Gath, the LORD’s hand was also against that city, throwing it into great confusion and afflicting the men of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.
7246	8	5	10	5	10	So they sent the ark of God to Ekron, but as it arrived, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought us the ark of the God of Israel in order to kill us and our people!”
7247	8	5	11	5	11	Then the Ekronites assembled all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel. It must return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people!” For a deadly confusion had pervaded the city; the hand of God was heavy upon it.
7248	8	5	12	5	12	Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
7249	8	6	1	6	1	When the ark of the LORD had been in the land of the Philistines for seven months,
7250	8	6	2	6	2	the Philistines summoned the priests and diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to its place.”
7251	8	6	3	6	3	They replied, “If you return the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means return it to Him with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not been lifted from you.”
7252	8	6	4	6	4	“What guilt offering should we send back to Him?” asked the Philistines. “Five gold tumors and five gold rats,” they said, “according to the number of rulers of the Philistines, since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.
7253	8	6	5	6	5	Make images of your tumors and of the rats that are ravaging the land. Give glory to the God of Israel, and perhaps He will lift His hand from you and your gods and your land.
7254	8	6	6	6	6	Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? When He afflicted them, did they not send the people on their way as they departed?
7255	8	6	7	6	7	Now, therefore, prepare one new cart with two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.
7256	8	6	8	6	8	Take the ark of the LORD, set it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending Him as a guilt offering. Then send the ark on its way,
7257	8	6	9	6	9	but keep watching it. If it goes up the road to its homeland, toward Beth-shemesh, it is the LORD who has brought on us this great disaster. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not His hand that punished us and that it happened by chance.”
7258	8	6	10	6	10	So the men did as instructed. They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and penned up their calves.
7259	8	6	11	6	11	Then they put the ark of the LORD on the cart, along with the chest containing the gold rats and the images of the tumors.
7260	8	6	12	6	12	And the cows headed straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh, staying on that one highway and lowing as they went, never straying to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
7261	8	6	13	6	13	Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed at the sight.
7262	8	6	14	6	14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
7263	8	6	15	6	15	And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold objects, and they placed them on the large rock. That day the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.
7264	8	6	16	6	16	And when the five rulers of the Philistines had seen this, they returned to Ekron that same day.
7265	8	6	17	6	17	As a guilt offering to the LORD, the Philistines had sent back one gold tumor for each city: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
7266	8	6	18	6	18	The number of gold rats also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities belonging to the five rulers—the fortified cities and their outlying villages. And the large rock on which they placed the ark of the LORD stands to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
7267	8	6	19	6	19	But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the LORD. He struck down seventy men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck them with a great slaughter.
7268	8	6	20	6	20	The men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom should the ark go up from here?”
7269	8	6	21	6	21	So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up with you.”
7270	8	7	1	7	1	Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the LORD and took it into Abinadab’s house on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD.
7271	8	7	2	7	2	And from that day a long time passed, twenty years in all, as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim. And all the house of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD.
7272	8	7	3	7	3	Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you, prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only. And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
7273	8	7	4	7	4	So the Israelites put away the Baals and Ashtoreths and served only the LORD.
7274	8	7	5	7	5	Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf.”
7275	8	7	6	7	6	When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted, and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.
7276	8	7	7	7	7	When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines
7277	8	7	8	7	8	and said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
7278	8	7	9	7	9	Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him.
7279	8	7	10	7	10	As the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel, Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering. But that day the LORD thundered loudly against the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel.
7280	8	7	11	7	11	Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth-car.
7281	8	7	12	7	12	Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.”
7282	8	7	13	7	13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped invading the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
7283	8	7	14	7	14	The cities from Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had taken, were restored to Israel, who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites.
7284	8	7	15	7	15	So Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
7285	8	7	16	7	16	Every year he would go on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all these places.
7286	8	7	17	7	17	Then he would return to Ramah because his home was there, and there he judged Israel and built an altar to the LORD.
7287	8	8	1	8	1	When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
7288	8	8	2	8	2	The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
7289	8	8	3	8	3	But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside toward dishonest gain, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.
7290	8	8	4	8	4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
7291	8	8	5	8	5	“Look,” they said, “you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations.”
7292	8	8	6	8	6	But when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD.
7293	8	8	7	8	7	And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected Me as their king.
7294	8	8	8	8	8	Just as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.
7295	8	8	9	8	9	Now listen to them, but you must solemnly warn them and show them the manner of the king who will reign over them.”
7296	8	8	10	8	10	So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.
7297	8	8	11	8	11	He said, “This will be the manner of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them to his own chariots and horses, to run in front of his chariots.
7298	8	8	12	8	12	He will appoint some for himself as commanders of thousands and of fifties, and others to plow his ground, to reap his harvest, to make his weapons of war, and to equip his chariots.
7299	8	8	13	8	13	And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
7300	8	8	14	8	14	He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his servants.
7301	8	8	15	8	15	He will take a tenth of your grain and grape harvest and give it to his officials and servants.
7302	8	8	16	8	16	And he will take your menservants and maidservants and your best cattle and donkeys and put them to his own use.
7303	8	8	17	8	17	He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.
7304	8	8	18	8	18	When that day comes, you will beg for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you on that day.”
7305	8	8	19	8	19	Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We must have a king over us.
7306	8	8	20	8	20	Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to judge us, to go out before us, and to fight our battles.”
7307	8	8	21	8	21	Samuel listened to all the words of the people and repeated them in the hearing of the LORD.
7308	8	8	22	8	22	“Listen to their voice,” the LORD said to Samuel. “Appoint a king for them.” Then Samuel told the men of Israel, “Everyone must go back to his city.”
7309	8	9	1	9	1	Now there was a Benjamite, a powerful man, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
7310	8	9	2	9	2	And he had a son named Saul, choice and handsome, without equal among the Israelites—a head taller than any of the people.
7311	8	9	3	9	3	One day the donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.”
7312	8	9	4	9	4	So Saul passed through the hill country of Ephraim and then through the land of Shalishah, but did not find the donkeys. He and the servant went through the region of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they went through the land of Benjamin, and still they did not find them.
7313	8	9	5	9	5	When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Come, let us go back, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”
7314	8	9	6	9	6	“Look,” said the servant, “in this city there is a man of God who is highly respected; everything he says surely comes to pass. Let us go there now. Perhaps he will tell us which way to go.”
7315	8	9	7	9	7	“If we do go,” Saul replied, “what can we give the man? For the bread in our packs is gone, and there is no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?”
7316	8	9	8	9	8	The servant answered him again. “Look,” he said “I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.”
7317	8	9	9	9	9	(Formerly in Israel, a man on his way to inquire of God would say, “Come, let us go to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.)
7318	8	9	10	9	10	“Good,” said Saul to his servant. “Come, let us go.” So they set out for the city where the man of God was.
7319	8	9	11	9	11	And as they were climbing the hill to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water and asked, “Is the seer here?”
7320	8	9	12	9	12	“Yes, he is ahead of you,” they answered. “Hurry now, for today he has come to the city because the people have a sacrifice on the high place.
7321	8	9	13	9	13	As soon as you enter the city you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests will eat. Go up at once; you will find him.”
7322	8	9	14	9	14	So Saul and his servant went up toward the city, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
7323	8	9	15	9	15	Now on the day before Saul’s arrival, the LORD had revealed to Samuel,
7324	8	9	16	9	16	“At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you are to anoint him leader over My people Israel; he will save them from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.”
7325	8	9	17	9	17	When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, “Here is the man of whom I spoke; he shall rule over My people.”
7326	8	9	18	9	18	Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
7327	8	9	19	9	19	“I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. And when I send you off in the morning, I will tell you all that is in your heart.
7328	8	9	20	9	20	As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And upon whom is all the desire of Israel, if not upon you and all your father’s house?”
7329	8	9	21	9	21	Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin? So why would you say such a thing to me?”
7330	8	9	22	9	22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them into the hall, and seated them in the place of honor among those who were invited—about thirty in all.
7331	8	9	23	9	23	And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you and told you to set aside.”
7332	8	9	24	9	24	So the cook picked up the leg and what was attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, “Here is what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat, for it has been kept for you for this occasion, from the time I said, ‘I have invited the people.’” So Saul dined with Samuel that day.
7333	8	9	25	9	25	And after they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house.
7334	8	9	26	9	26	They got up early in the morning, and just before dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I will send you on your way!” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went outside together.
7335	8	9	27	9	27	As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for a while, and I will reveal to you the word of God.” So the servant went on.
7336	8	10	1	10	1	Then Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it out on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance?
7337	8	10	2	10	2	When you leave me today, you will find two men at Rachel’s tomb in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you seek have been found, and now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and started worrying about you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”’
7338	8	10	3	10	3	Then you will go on from there until you come to the Oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
7339	8	10	4	10	4	They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hands.
7340	8	10	5	10	5	After that you will come to Gibeah of God, where the Philistines have an outpost. As you approach the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying.
7341	8	10	6	10	6	Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be transformed into a different person.
7342	8	10	7	10	7	When these signs have come, do as the occasion demands, for God is with you.
7343	8	10	8	10	8	And you shall go before me to Gilgal, and surely I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you are to do.”
7344	8	10	9	10	9	As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart, and all the signs came to pass that day.
7345	8	10	10	10	10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with them.
7346	8	10	11	10	11	All those who had formerly known Saul and saw him prophesying with the prophets asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
7347	8	10	12	10	12	Then a man who lived there replied, “And who is their father?” So the saying became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
7348	8	10	13	10	13	And when Saul had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
7349	8	10	14	10	14	Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you go?” “To look for the donkeys,” Saul replied. “When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
7350	8	10	15	10	15	“Tell me,” Saul’s uncle asked, “what did Samuel say to you?”
7351	8	10	16	10	16	And Saul replied, “He assured us that the donkeys had been found.” But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.
7352	8	10	17	10	17	After this, Samuel summoned the people to the LORD at Mizpah
7353	8	10	18	10	18	and said to the Israelites, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’
7354	8	10	19	10	19	But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your troubles and afflictions, and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.”
7355	8	10	20	10	20	Thus Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected.
7356	8	10	21	10	21	Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the clan of Matri was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they looked for him, they could not find him.
7357	8	10	22	10	22	So again they inquired of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD replied, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
7358	8	10	23	10	23	So they ran and brought Saul, and when he stood among the people, he was a head taller than any of the others.
7359	8	10	24	10	24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
7360	8	10	25	10	25	Then Samuel explained to the people the rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own home.
7361	8	10	26	10	26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, and the men of valor whose hearts God had touched went with him.
7362	8	10	27	10	27	But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him and brought him no gifts; but Saul remained silent about it.
7363	8	11	1	11	1	Soon Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.”
7364	8	11	2	11	2	But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you on one condition, that I may put out everyone’s right eye and bring reproach upon all Israel.”
7365	8	11	3	11	3	“Hold off for seven days,” replied the elders of Jabesh, “and let us send messengers throughout Israel. If there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.”
7366	8	11	4	11	4	When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and relayed these words in the hearing of the people, they all wept aloud.
7367	8	11	5	11	5	Just then Saul was returning from the field, behind his oxen. “What troubles the people?” asked Saul. “Why are they weeping?” And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh.
7368	8	11	6	11	6	When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he burned with great anger.
7369	8	11	7	11	7	He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout the land of Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the LORD fell upon the people, and they turned out as one man.
7370	8	11	8	11	8	And when Saul numbered them at Bezek, there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah.
7371	8	11	9	11	9	So they said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.’” And when the messengers relayed this to the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
7372	8	11	10	11	10	Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do with us whatever seems good to you.”
7373	8	11	11	11	11	The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions, and during the morning watch they invaded the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of the day. And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together.
7374	8	11	12	11	12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said that Saul should not reign over us? Bring those men here so we can kill them!”
7375	8	11	13	11	13	But Saul ordered, “No one shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.”
7376	8	11	14	11	14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.”
7377	8	11	15	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.
7378	8	12	1	12	1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to your voice in all that you have said to me, and I have set over you a king.
7379	8	12	2	12	2	Now here is the king walking before you, and I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
7380	8	12	3	12	3	Here I am. Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it to you.”
7381	8	12	4	12	4	“You have not wronged us or oppressed us,” they replied, “nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.”
7382	8	12	5	12	5	Samuel said to them, “The LORD is a witness against you, and His anointed is a witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand.” “He is a witness,” they replied.
7383	8	12	6	12	6	Then Samuel said to the people, “The LORD is the One who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
7384	8	12	7	12	7	Now present yourselves, so that I may confront you before the LORD with all the righteous acts He has done for you and your fathers.
7385	8	12	8	12	8	When Jacob went to Egypt, your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He sent them Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
7386	8	12	9	12	9	But they forgot the LORD their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them.
7387	8	12	10	12	10	Then they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and Ashtoreths. Now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, that we may serve You.’
7388	8	12	11	12	11	So the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you lived securely.
7389	8	12	12	12	12	But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we must have a king to rule over us’—even though the LORD your God was your king.
7390	8	12	13	12	13	Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you requested. Behold, the LORD has placed a king over you.
7391	8	12	14	12	14	If you fear the LORD and serve Him and obey His voice, and if you do not rebel against the command of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD your God, then all will be well.
7392	8	12	15	12	15	But if you disobey the LORD and rebel against His command, then the hand of the LORD will be against you as it was against your fathers.
7393	8	12	16	12	16	Now, therefore, stand and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
7394	8	12	17	12	17	Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on the LORD to send thunder and rain, so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed in the sight of the LORD by asking for a king.”
7395	8	12	18	12	18	So Samuel called to the LORD, and on that day the LORD sent thunder and rain. As a result, all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
7396	8	12	19	12	19	They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die! For we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king.”
7397	8	12	20	12	20	“Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “Even though you have committed all this evil, do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
7398	8	12	21	12	21	Do not turn aside after worthless things that cannot profit you or deliver you, for they are empty.
7399	8	12	22	12	22	Indeed, for the sake of His great name the LORD will not abandon His people, because He was pleased to make you His own.
7400	8	12	23	12	23	As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you the good and right way.
7401	8	12	24	12	24	Above all, fear the LORD and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things He has done for you.
7402	8	12	25	12	25	But if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”
7403	8	13	1	13	1	Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.
7404	8	13	2	13	2	He chose for himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home.
7405	8	13	3	13	3	Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
7406	8	13	4	13	4	And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
7407	8	13	5	13	5	Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
7408	8	13	6	13	6	Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns.
7409	8	13	7	13	7	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear.
7410	8	13	8	13	8	And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul.
7411	8	13	9	13	9	So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering.
7412	8	13	10	13	10	Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.
7413	8	13	11	13	11	“What have you done?” Samuel asked. And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,
7414	8	13	12	13	12	I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”
7415	8	13	13	13	13	“You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
7416	8	13	14	13	14	But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.”
7417	8	13	15	13	15	Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin. And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.
7418	8	13	16	13	16	Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
7419	8	13	17	13	17	And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,
7420	8	13	18	13	18	another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.
7421	8	13	19	13	19	And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.”
7422	8	13	20	13	20	Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.
7423	8	13	21	13	21	The charge was a pim for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad.
7424	8	13	22	13	22	So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.
7425	8	13	23	13	23	And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash.
7426	8	14	1	14	1	One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.” But Jonathan did not tell his father.
7427	8	14	2	14	2	Meanwhile, Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah. And the troops who were with him numbered about six hundred men,
7428	8	14	3	14	3	including Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in Shiloh. But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left.
7429	8	14	4	14	4	Now there were cliffs on both sides of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost. One was named Bozez and the other Seneh.
7430	8	14	5	14	5	One cliff stood to the north toward Michmash, and the other to the south toward Geba.
7431	8	14	6	14	6	Jonathan said to the young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.”
7432	8	14	7	14	7	His armor-bearer replied, “Do all that is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”
7433	8	14	8	14	8	“Very well,” said Jonathan, “we will cross over toward these men and show ourselves to them.
7434	8	14	9	14	9	If they say, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stay where we are and will not go up to them.
7435	8	14	10	14	10	But if they say, ‘Come on up,’ then we will go up, because this will be our sign that the LORD has delivered them into our hands.”
7436	8	14	11	14	11	So the two of them showed themselves to the outpost of the Philistines, who exclaimed, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!”
7437	8	14	12	14	12	So the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come on up, and we will teach you a lesson!” “Follow me,” Jonathan told his armor-bearer, “for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”
7438	8	14	13	14	13	And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. And the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off.
7439	8	14	14	14	14	In that first assault, Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down about twenty men over half an acre of land.
7440	8	14	15	14	15	Then terror struck the Philistines in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even those in the outposts and raiding parties trembled. Indeed, the earth quaked and panic spread from God.
7441	8	14	16	14	16	Now when Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in Benjamin looked and saw the troops melting away and scattering in every direction,
7442	8	14	17	14	17	Saul said to the troops who were with him, “Call the roll and see who has left us.” And when they had called the roll, they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
7443	8	14	18	14	18	Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God.” (For at that time it was with the Israelites.)
7444	8	14	19	14	19	While Saul was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued to increase. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
7445	8	14	20	14	20	Then Saul and all his troops assembled and marched to the battle, and they found the Philistines in total confusion, with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor.
7446	8	14	21	14	21	And the Hebrews who had previously gone up into the surrounding camps of the Philistines now went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
7447	8	14	22	14	22	When all the Israelites who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also joined Saul and Jonathan in the battle.
7448	8	14	23	14	23	So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth-aven.
7449	8	14	24	14	24	Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, for Saul had placed the troops under an oath, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the troops tasted any food.
7450	8	14	25	14	25	Then all the troops entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.
7451	8	14	26	14	26	And when they entered the forest and saw the flowing honey, not one of them put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.
7452	8	14	27	14	27	Jonathan, however, had not heard that his father had charged the people with the oath. So he reached out the end of the staff in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.
7453	8	14	28	14	28	Then one of the soldiers told him, “Your father bound the troops with a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ That is why the people are faint.”
7454	8	14	29	14	29	“My father has brought trouble to the land,” Jonathan replied. “Just look at how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
7455	8	14	30	14	30	How much better it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been much greater?”
7456	8	14	31	14	31	That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people were very faint.
7457	8	14	32	14	32	So they rushed greedily to the plunder, taking sheep, cattle, and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate meat with the blood still in it.
7458	8	14	33	14	33	Then someone reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.” “You have broken faith,” said Saul. “Roll a large stone over here at once.”
7459	8	14	34	14	34	Then he said, “Go among the troops and tell them, ‘Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep, slaughter them in this place, and then eat. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’” So that night everyone brought his ox and slaughtered it there.
7460	8	14	35	14	35	Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD.
7461	8	14	36	14	36	And Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn, leaving no man alive!” “Do whatever seems good to you,” the troops replied. But the priest said, “We must consult God here.”
7462	8	14	37	14	37	So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of Israel?” But God did not answer him that day.
7463	8	14	38	14	38	Therefore Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the troops, and let us investigate how this sin has occurred today.
7464	8	14	39	14	39	As surely as the LORD who saves Israel lives, even if it is my son Jonathan, he must die!” But not one of the troops said a word.
7465	8	14	40	14	40	Then Saul said to all Israel, “You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.” And the troops replied, “Do what seems good to you.”
7466	8	14	41	14	41	So Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the charge.
7467	8	14	42	14	42	Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected.
7468	8	14	43	14	43	“Tell me what you have done,” Saul commanded him. So Jonathan told him, “I only tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. And now I must die?”
7469	8	14	44	14	44	And Saul declared, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if you, Jonathan, do not surely die!”
7470	8	14	45	14	45	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die—he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for with God’s help he has accomplished this today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.
7471	8	14	46	14	46	Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own land.
7472	8	14	47	14	47	After Saul had assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he routed them.
7473	8	14	48	14	48	He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of its plunderers.
7474	8	14	49	14	49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn) and Michal (his younger daughter).
7475	8	14	50	14	50	His wife’s name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Saul’s uncle Ner.
7476	8	14	51	14	51	Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
7477	8	14	52	14	52	And the war with the Philistines was fierce for all the days of Saul. So whenever he noticed any strong or brave man, Saul would enlist him.
7478	8	15	1	15	1	Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD.
7479	8	15	2	15	2	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they ambushed them on their way up from Egypt.
7480	8	15	3	15	3	Now go and attack the Amalekites and devote to destruction all that belongs to them. Do not spare them, but put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”
7481	8	15	4	15	4	So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.
7482	8	15	5	15	5	Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
7483	8	15	6	15	6	And he warned the Kenites, “Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt, go on and get away from the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
7484	8	15	7	15	7	Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt.
7485	8	15	8	15	8	He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but devoted all the others to destruction with the sword.
7486	8	15	9	15	9	Saul and his troops spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs, and the best of everything else. They were unwilling to destroy them, but they devoted to destruction all that was despised and worthless.
7487	8	15	10	15	10	Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying,
7488	8	15	11	15	11	“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions.” And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all that night.
7489	8	15	12	15	12	Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and behold, he has set up a monument for himself and has turned and gone down to Gilgal.”
7490	8	15	13	15	13	When Samuel reached him, Saul said to him, “May the LORD bless you. I have carried out the LORD’s instructions.”
7491	8	15	14	15	14	But Samuel replied, “Then what is this bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle that I hear?”
7492	8	15	15	15	15	Saul answered, “The troops brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but the rest we devoted to destruction.”
7493	8	15	16	15	16	“Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” “Tell me,” Saul replied.
7494	8	15	17	15	17	And Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, have you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel
7495	8	15	18	15	18	and sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and devote to destruction the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until you have wiped them out.’
7496	8	15	19	15	19	So why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you rush upon the plunder and do evil in the sight of the LORD?”
7497	8	15	20	15	20	“But I did obey the LORD,” Saul replied. “I went on the mission that the LORD gave me. I brought back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
7498	8	15	21	15	21	The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of the things devoted to destruction, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal.”
7499	8	15	22	15	22	But Samuel declared: “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obedience to His voice? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, and attentiveness is better than the fat of rams.
7500	8	15	23	15	23	For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance is like the wickedness of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has rejected you as king.”
7501	8	15	24	15	24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have transgressed the LORD’s commandment and your instructions, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
7502	8	15	25	15	25	Now therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship the LORD.”
7503	8	15	26	15	26	“I will not return with you,” Samuel replied. “For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and He has rejected you as king over Israel.”
7504	8	15	27	15	27	As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore.
7505	8	15	28	15	28	So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor who is better than you.
7506	8	15	29	15	29	Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not lie or change His mind, for He is not a man, that He should change His mind.”
7507	8	15	30	15	30	“I have sinned,” Saul replied. “Please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.”
7508	8	15	31	15	31	So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
7509	8	15	32	15	32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” Agag came to him cheerfully, for he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
7510	8	15	33	15	33	But Samuel declared: “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
7511	8	15	34	15	34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
7512	8	15	35	15	35	And to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
7513	8	16	1	16	1	Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have selected from his sons a king for Myself.”
7514	8	16	2	16	2	“How can I go?” Samuel asked. “Saul will hear of it and kill me!” The LORD answered, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’
7515	8	16	3	16	3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you are to do. You are to anoint for Me the one I indicate.”
7516	8	16	4	16	4	So Samuel did what the LORD had said and went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled and asked, “Do you come in peace?”
7517	8	16	5	16	5	“In peace,” he replied. “I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
7518	8	16	6	16	6	When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and said, “Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.”
7519	8	16	7	16	7	But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; the LORD does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but the LORD sees the heart.”
7520	8	16	8	16	8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
7521	8	16	9	16	9	Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
7522	8	16	10	16	10	Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel told him, “The LORD has not chosen any of these.”
7523	8	16	11	16	11	And Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?” “There is still the youngest,” Jesse replied, “but he is tending the sheep.” “Send for him,” Samuel replied. “For we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.”
7524	8	16	12	16	12	So Jesse sent for his youngest son and brought him in. He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him, for he is the one.”
7525	8	16	13	16	13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah.
7526	8	16	14	16	14	After the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, a spirit of distress from the LORD began to torment him.
7527	8	16	15	16	15	Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely a spirit of distress from God is tormenting you.
7528	8	16	16	16	16	Let our lord command your servants here to seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp. Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you, he is to play it, and you will be well.”
7529	8	16	17	16	17	And Saul commanded his servants, “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him to me.”
7530	8	16	18	16	18	One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, eloquent and handsome, and the LORD is with him.”
7531	8	16	19	16	19	So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”
7532	8	16	20	16	20	And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat, and sent them to Saul with his son David.
7533	8	16	21	16	21	When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul admired him greatly, and David became his armor-bearer.
7534	8	16	22	16	22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”
7535	8	16	23	16	23	And whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would pick up his harp and play, and Saul would become well, and the spirit of distress would depart from him.
7536	8	17	1	17	1	Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.
7537	8	17	2	17	2	Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, arraying themselves for battle against the Philistines.
7538	8	17	3	17	3	The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them.
7539	8	17	4	17	4	Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height,
7540	8	17	5	17	5	and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels,
7541	8	17	6	17	6	and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.
7542	8	17	7	17	7	The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him.
7543	8	17	8	17	8	And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me.
7544	8	17	9	17	9	If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and labor for us.”
7545	8	17	10	17	10	Then the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man to fight!”
7546	8	17	11	17	11	On hearing the words of the Philistine, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid.
7547	8	17	12	17	12	Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah who had eight sons in the days of Saul. And Jesse was old and well along in years.
7548	8	17	13	17	13	The three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah.
7549	8	17	14	17	14	And David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul,
7550	8	17	15	17	15	but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep in Bethlehem.
7551	8	17	16	17	16	For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening to take his stand.
7552	8	17	17	17	17	One day Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
7553	8	17	18	17	18	Take also these ten portions of cheese to the commander of their unit. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back an assurance from them.
7554	8	17	19	17	19	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”
7555	8	17	20	17	20	So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He reached the camp as the army was marching out to its position and shouting the battle cry.
7556	8	17	21	17	21	And Israel and the Philistines arrayed in formation against each other.
7557	8	17	22	17	22	Then David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing.
7558	8	17	23	17	23	And as he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistines and shouted his usual words, which David also heard.
7559	8	17	24	17	24	When all the men of Israel saw Goliath, they fled from him in great fear.
7560	8	17	25	17	25	Now the men of Israel had been saying, “Do you see this man who keeps coming out to defy Israel? To the man who kills him the king will give great riches. And he will give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s house from taxation in Israel.”
7561	8	17	26	17	26	David asked the men who were standing with him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
7562	8	17	27	17	27	The people told him about the offer, saying, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.”
7563	8	17	28	17	28	Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, his anger burned against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and wickedness of heart—you have come down to see the battle!”
7564	8	17	29	17	29	“What have I done now?” said David. “Was it not just a question?”
7565	8	17	30	17	30	Then he turned from him toward another and asked about the offer, and those people answered him just as the first ones had answered.
7566	8	17	31	17	31	Now David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, who called for him.
7567	8	17	32	17	32	And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!”
7568	8	17	33	17	33	But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.”
7569	8	17	34	17	34	David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock,
7570	8	17	35	17	35	I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it.
7571	8	17	36	17	36	Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.”
7572	8	17	37	17	37	David added, “The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” “Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD be with you.”
7573	8	17	38	17	38	Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic, put a bronze helmet on his head, and dressed him in armor.
7574	8	17	39	17	39	David strapped his sword over the tunic and tried to walk, but he was not accustomed to them. “I cannot walk in these,” David said to Saul. “I am not accustomed to them.” So David took them off.
7575	8	17	40	17	40	And David took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag. And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine.
7576	8	17	41	17	41	Now the Philistine came closer and closer to David, with his shield-bearer before him.
7577	8	17	42	17	42	When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a boy, ruddy and handsome.
7578	8	17	43	17	43	“Am I a dog,” he said to David, “that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
7579	8	17	44	17	44	“Come here,” he called to David, “and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!”
7580	8	17	45	17	45	But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
7581	8	17	46	17	46	This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
7582	8	17	47	17	47	And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.”
7583	8	17	48	17	48	As the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
7584	8	17	49	17	49	Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, and slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.
7585	8	17	50	17	50	Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
7586	8	17	51	17	51	David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine’s sword and pulled it from its sheath and killed him; and he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.
7587	8	17	52	17	52	Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. And the bodies of the Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
7588	8	17	53	17	53	When the Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps.
7589	8	17	54	17	54	David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent.
7590	8	17	55	17	55	As Saul had watched David going out to confront the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” “As surely as you live, O king,” Abner replied, “I do not know.”
7591	8	17	56	17	56	“Find out whose son this young man is!” said the king.
7592	8	17	57	17	57	So when David returned from killing the Philistine, still holding his head in his hand, Abner took him and brought him before Saul.
7593	8	17	58	17	58	“Whose son are you, young man?” asked Saul. “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,” David replied.
7594	8	18	1	18	1	After David had finished speaking with Saul, the souls of Jonathan and David were knit together, and Jonathan loved him as himself.
7595	8	18	2	18	2	And from that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father’s house.
7596	8	18	3	18	3	Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
7597	8	18	4	18	4	And Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, his sword, his bow, and his belt.
7598	8	18	5	18	5	So David marched out and prospered in everything Saul sent him to do, and Saul set him over the men of war. And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and of Saul’s officers as well.
7599	8	18	6	18	6	As the troops were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs, and with tambourines and other instruments.
7600	8	18	7	18	7	And as the women danced, they sang out: “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.”
7601	8	18	8	18	8	And Saul was furious and resented this song. “They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,” he said, “but only thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?”
7602	8	18	9	18	9	And from that day forward Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
7603	8	18	10	18	10	The next day a spirit of distress sent from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house while David played the harp as usual. Now Saul was holding a spear,
7604	8	18	11	18	11	and he hurled it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.
7605	8	18	12	18	12	So Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had departed from Saul.
7606	8	18	13	18	13	Therefore Saul sent David away and gave him command of a thousand men. David led the troops out to battle and back,
7607	8	18	14	18	14	and he continued to prosper in all his ways, because the LORD was with him.
7608	8	18	15	18	15	When Saul saw that David was very successful, he was afraid of him.
7609	8	18	16	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he was leading them out to battle and back.
7610	8	18	17	18	17	Then Saul said to David, “Here is my oldest daughter, Merab. I will give her to you in marriage. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” But Saul was thinking, “I need not raise my hand against him; let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”
7611	8	18	18	18	18	And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel, that I should become the son-in-law of the king?”
7612	8	18	19	18	19	So when it was time to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.
7613	8	18	20	18	20	Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David, and when this was reported to Saul, it pleased him.
7614	8	18	21	18	21	“I will give her to David,” Saul thought, “so that she may be a snare to him, and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.”
7615	8	18	22	18	22	Then Saul ordered his servants, “Speak to David privately and tell him, ‘Behold, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become his son-in-law.’”
7616	8	18	23	18	23	But when Saul’s servants relayed these words to David, he replied, “Does it seem trivial in your sight to be the son-in-law of the king? I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.”
7617	8	18	24	18	24	And the servants told Saul what David had said.
7618	8	18	25	18	25	Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king desires no other dowry but a hundred Philistine foreskins as revenge on his enemies.’” But Saul intended to cause David’s death at the hands of the Philistines.
7619	8	18	26	18	26	When the servants reported these terms to David, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the wedding day arrived,
7620	8	18	27	18	27	David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as payment in full to become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave his daughter Michal to David in marriage.
7621	8	18	28	18	28	When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,
7622	8	18	29	18	29	he grew even more afraid of David. So from then on Saul was David’s enemy.
7623	8	18	30	18	30	Every time the Philistine commanders came out for battle, David was more successful than all of Saul’s officers, so that his name was highly esteemed.
7624	8	19	1	19	1	Then Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David. But Jonathan delighted greatly in David,
7625	8	19	2	19	2	so he warned David, saying, “My father Saul intends to kill you. Be on your guard in the morning; find a secret place and hide there.
7626	8	19	3	19	3	I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, so I can ask about you. And if I find out anything, I will tell you.”
7627	8	19	4	19	4	Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David; he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been highly beneficial to you.
7628	8	19	5	19	5	He took his life in his hands when he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced, so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?”
7629	8	19	6	19	6	Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore an oath: “As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death.”
7630	8	19	7	19	7	So Jonathan summoned David and told him all these things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul to serve him as he had before.
7631	8	19	8	19	8	When war broke out again, David went out and fought the Philistines and struck them with such a mighty blow that they fled before him.
7632	8	19	9	19	9	But as Saul was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, a spirit of distress from the LORD came upon him. While David was playing the harp,
7633	8	19	10	19	10	Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear. But the spear struck the wall and David eluded him, ran away, and escaped that night.
7634	8	19	11	19	11	Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michal warned him, “If you do not run for your life tonight, tomorrow you will be dead!”
7635	8	19	12	19	12	So Michal lowered David from the window, and he ran away and escaped.
7636	8	19	13	19	13	Then Michal took a household idol and laid it in the bed, placed some goat hair on its head, and covered it with a garment.
7637	8	19	14	19	14	When Saul sent the messengers to seize David, Michal said, “He is ill.”
7638	8	19	15	19	15	But Saul sent the messengers back to see David and told them, “Bring him up to me in his bed so I can kill him.”
7639	8	19	16	19	16	And when the messengers entered, there was the idol in the bed with the quilt of goats’ hair on its head.
7640	8	19	17	19	17	And Saul said to Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this? You sent my enemy away and he has escaped!” Michal replied, “He said to me, ‘Help me get away, or I will kill you!’”
7641	8	19	18	19	18	So David ran away and escaped. And he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.
7642	8	19	19	19	19	When Saul was told that David was at Naioth in Ramah,
7643	8	19	20	19	20	he sent messengers to capture him. But when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel leading them, the Spirit of God came upon them, and Saul’s messengers also began to prophesy.
7644	8	19	21	19	21	When this was reported to Saul, he sent more messengers, but they began to prophesy as well. So Saul tried again and sent messengers a third time, and even they began to prophesy.
7645	8	19	22	19	22	Finally, Saul himself left for Ramah and came to the large cistern at Secu, where he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” “At Naioth in Ramah,” he was told.
7646	8	19	23	19	23	So Saul went to Naioth in Ramah. But the Spirit of God came upon even Saul, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
7647	8	19	24	19	24	Then Saul stripped off his robes and also prophesied before Samuel. And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night. That is why it is said, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”
7648	8	20	1	20	1	Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? How have I sinned against your father, that he wants to take my life?”
7649	8	20	2	20	2	“Far from it!” Jonathan replied. “You will not die. Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This cannot be true!”
7650	8	20	3	20	3	But David again vowed, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.’ As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.”
7651	8	20	4	20	4	Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you desire, I will do for you.”
7652	8	20	5	20	5	So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I am supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let me go and hide in the field until the third evening from now.
7653	8	20	6	20	6	If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David urgently requested my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’
7654	8	20	7	20	7	If he says, ‘Good,’ then your servant is safe, but if he is enraged, you will know he has evil intentions.
7655	8	20	8	20	8	Therefore deal faithfully with your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD. If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?”
7656	8	20	9	20	9	“Never!” Jonathan replied. “If I ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you, would I not tell you?”
7657	8	20	10	20	10	Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
7658	8	20	11	20	11	“Come,” he replied, “let us go out to the field.” So the two of them went out into the field,
7659	8	20	12	20	12	and Jonathan said, “By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day. If he is favorable toward you, will I not send for you and tell you?
7660	8	20	13	20	13	But if my father intends to bring evil on you, then may the LORD punish me, and ever so severely, if I do not tell you and send you on your way in safety. May the LORD be with you, just as He has been with my father.
7661	8	20	14	20	14	And as long as I live, treat me with the LORD’s loving devotion that I may not die,
7662	8	20	15	20	15	and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from my household—not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”
7663	8	20	16	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the LORD hold David’s enemies accountable.”
7664	8	20	17	20	17	And Jonathan had David reaffirm his vow out of love for him, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself.
7665	8	20	18	20	18	Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon, and you will be missed if your seat is empty.
7666	8	20	19	20	19	When you have stayed three days, hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began, and remain beside the stone Ezel.
7667	8	20	20	20	20	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if I were aiming at a target.
7668	8	20	21	20	21	Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ Now, if I expressly say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them,’ then come, because as surely as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
7669	8	20	22	20	22	But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, for the LORD has sent you away.
7670	8	20	23	20	23	And as for the matter you and I have discussed, the LORD is a witness between you and me forever.”
7671	8	20	24	20	24	So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat.
7672	8	20	25	20	25	He sat in his usual place by the wall, opposite Jonathan and beside Abner, but David’s place was empty.
7673	8	20	26	20	26	Saul said nothing that day because he thought, “Something has happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.”
7674	8	20	27	20	27	But on the day after the New Moon, the second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?”
7675	8	20	28	20	28	Jonathan answered, “David urgently requested my permission to go to Bethlehem,
7676	8	20	29	20	29	saying, ‘Please let me go because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.’ That is why he did not come to the king’s table.”
7677	8	20	30	20	30	Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the disgrace of the mother who bore you?
7678	8	20	31	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingship shall be established. Now send for him and bring him to me, for he must surely die!”
7679	8	20	32	20	32	“Why must he be put to death?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?”
7680	8	20	33	20	33	Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.
7681	8	20	34	20	34	Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the month, for he was grieved by his father’s shameful treatment of David.
7682	8	20	35	20	35	In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.
7683	8	20	36	20	36	He said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” And as the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.
7684	8	20	37	20	37	When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called to him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”
7685	8	20	38	20	38	Then Jonathan cried out, “Hurry! Make haste! Do not delay!” So the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
7686	8	20	39	20	39	But the boy did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.
7687	8	20	40	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the boy and said, “Go, take it back to the city.”
7688	8	20	41	20	41	When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone, fell facedown, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept together—though David wept more.
7689	8	20	42	20	42	And Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘May the LORD be a witness between you and me, and between your descendants and mine forever.’”
7690	8	21	1	20	42	Then David got up and departed, and Jonathan went back into the city.
7691	8	21	2	21	1	Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And when Ahimelech met David, he trembled and asked him, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”
7692	8	21	3	21	2	“The king has given me a mission,” David replied. “He told me no one is to know about the mission or charge. And I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place.
7693	8	21	4	21	3	Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”
7694	8	21	5	21	4	“There is no common bread on hand,” the priest replied, “but there is some consecrated bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”
7695	8	21	6	21	5	David answered, “Women have indeed been kept from us, as usual when I set out. And the equipment of the young men is holy, as it is even on common missions, and all the more at this time.”
7696	8	21	7	21	6	So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence, which had been removed from before the LORD and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away.
7697	8	21	8	21	7	Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the LORD. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief shepherd for Saul.
7698	8	21	9	21	8	Then David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not a spear or sword on hand here? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent.”
7699	8	21	10	21	9	The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want, you may take it. For there is no other but this one.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
7700	8	21	11	21	10	That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
7701	8	21	12	21	11	But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing about him in their dances, saying: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?”
7702	8	21	13	21	12	Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
7703	8	21	14	21	13	So he changed his behavior before them and feigned madness in their hands; he scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard.
7704	8	21	15	21	14	Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you can see the man is insane! Why have you brought him to me?
7705	8	21	16	21	15	Am I in need of madmen, that you have brought this man to rave in my presence? Must this man come into my house?”
7706	8	22	1	22	1	So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.
7707	8	22	2	22	2	And all who were distressed or indebted or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
7708	8	22	3	22	3	From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab, where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I learn what God will do for me.”
7709	8	22	4	22	4	So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold.
7710	8	22	5	22	5	Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
7711	8	22	6	22	6	Soon Saul learned that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in hand and all his servants standing around him.
7712	8	22	7	22	7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Is the son of Jesse giving all of you fields and vineyards and making you commanders of thousands or hundreds?
7713	8	22	8	22	8	Is that why all of you have conspired against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made a covenant with Jesse’s son. Not one of you has shown concern for me or revealed to me that my son has stirred up my own servant to lie in wait against me, as is the case today.”
7714	8	22	9	22	9	But Doeg the Edomite, who had stationed himself with Saul’s servants, answered: “I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
7715	8	22	10	22	10	Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions. He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
7716	8	22	11	22	11	Then the king sent messengers to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and his father’s whole family, who were priests at Nob. And all of them came to the king.
7717	8	22	12	22	12	“Listen now, son of Ahitub,” said Saul. “Here I am, my lord,” he replied.
7718	8	22	13	22	13	And Saul asked him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him so that he could rise up against me to lie in wait, as he is doing today.”
7719	8	22	14	22	14	Ahimelech answered the king, “Who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguard who is honored in your house?
7720	8	22	15	22	15	Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of my father’s household, for your servant knew nothing of this whole affair—not in part or in whole.”
7721	8	22	16	22	16	But the king replied, “You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!”
7722	8	22	17	22	17	Then the king ordered the guards at his side, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too sided with David. For they knew he was fleeing, but they did not tell me.” But the king’s servants would not lift a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
7723	8	22	18	22	18	So the king ordered Doeg, “You turn and strike down the priests!” And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests himself. On that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
7724	8	22	19	22	19	He also put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, with its men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.
7725	8	22	20	22	20	But one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.
7726	8	22	21	22	21	And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
7727	8	22	22	22	22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that Doeg the Edomite was there that day, and that he was sure to tell Saul. I myself am responsible for the lives of everyone in your father’s house.
7728	8	22	23	22	23	Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks your life is seeking mine as well. You will be safe with me.”
7729	8	23	1	23	1	Now it was reported to David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and looting the threshing floors.”
7730	8	23	2	23	2	So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”
7731	8	23	3	23	3	But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
7732	8	23	4	23	4	Once again, David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him: “Go at once to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
7733	8	23	5	23	5	Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, and carried off their livestock, striking them with a mighty blow. So David saved the people of Keilah.
7734	8	23	6	23	6	(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)
7735	8	23	7	23	7	When Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, he said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.”
7736	8	23	8	23	8	Then Saul summoned all his troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.
7737	8	23	9	23	9	When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.”
7738	8	23	10	23	10	And David said, “O LORD, God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the city on my account.
7739	8	23	11	23	11	Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” “He will,” said the LORD.
7740	8	23	12	23	12	So David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” “They will,” said the LORD.
7741	8	23	13	23	13	Then David and his men, about six hundred strong, set out and departed from Keilah, moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he declined to go forth.
7742	8	23	14	23	14	And David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God would not deliver David into his hand.
7743	8	23	15	23	15	While David was in Horesh in the Wilderness of Ziph, he saw that Saul had come out to take his life.
7744	8	23	16	23	16	And Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and strengthened his hand in God,
7745	8	23	17	23	17	saying, “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. And you will be king over Israel, and I will be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this is true.”
7746	8	23	18	23	18	So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. And David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home.
7747	8	23	19	23	19	Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon?
7748	8	23	20	23	20	Now, O king, come down whenever your soul desires, and we will be responsible for delivering him into your hands.”
7749	8	23	21	23	21	“May you be blessed by the LORD,” replied Saul, “for you have had compassion on me.
7750	8	23	22	23	22	Please go and prepare further. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning.
7751	8	23	23	23	23	Observe and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.”
7752	8	23	24	23	24	So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon,
7753	8	23	25	23	25	and Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard of this, he pursued David there.
7754	8	23	26	23	26	Saul was proceeding along one side of the mountain, and David and his men along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
7755	8	23	27	23	27	Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!”
7756	8	23	28	23	28	So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why that place is called Sela-hammahlekoth.
7757	8	24	1	23	29	And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.
7758	8	24	2	24	1	After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”
7759	8	24	3	24	2	So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
7760	8	24	4	24	3	Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave.
7761	8	24	5	24	4	So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’” Then David crept up secretly and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.
7762	8	24	6	24	5	Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.
7763	8	24	7	24	6	So he said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.”
7764	8	24	8	24	7	With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.
7765	8	24	9	24	8	After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence
7766	8	24	10	24	9	and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’?
7767	8	24	11	24	10	Behold, this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the LORD’s anointed.’
7768	8	24	12	24	11	See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life.
7769	8	24	13	24	12	May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you.
7770	8	24	14	24	13	As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you.
7771	8	24	15	24	14	Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
7772	8	24	16	24	15	May the LORD be our judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.”
7773	8	24	17	24	16	When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” Then Saul wept aloud
7774	8	24	18	24	17	and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil.
7775	8	24	19	24	18	And you have shown this day how well you have dealt with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me.
7776	8	24	20	24	19	When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day.
7777	8	24	21	24	20	Now I know for sure that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
7778	8	24	22	24	21	So now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.”
7779	8	24	23	24	22	So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
7780	8	25	1	25	1	When Samuel died, all Israel gathered to mourn for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David set out and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.
7781	8	25	2	25	2	Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. He was a very wealthy man with a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.
7782	8	25	3	25	3	His name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in his dealings.
7783	8	25	4	25	4	While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
7784	8	25	5	25	5	So David sent ten young men and instructed them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel. Greet him in my name
7785	8	25	6	25	6	and say to him, ‘Long life to you, and peace to you and your house and to all that belongs to you.
7786	8	25	7	25	7	Now I hear that it is time for shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them, and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel.
7787	8	25	8	25	8	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find favor with you, for we have come on the day of a feast. Please give whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.’”
7788	8	25	9	25	9	When David’s young men arrived, they relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David. Then they waited.
7789	8	25	10	25	10	But Nabal asked them, “Who is David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters.
7790	8	25	11	25	11	Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give them to these men whose origin I do not know?”
7791	8	25	12	25	12	So David’s men turned around and went back, and they relayed to him all these words.
7792	8	25	13	25	13	And David said to his men, “Strap on your swords!” So David and all his men put on their swords, and about four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
7793	8	25	14	25	14	Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s young men informed Nabal’s wife Abigail, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he scolded them.
7794	8	25	15	25	15	Yet these men were very good to us. When we were in the field, we were not harassed, and nothing of ours went missing the whole time we lived among them.
7795	8	25	16	25	16	They were a wall around us, both day and night, the whole time we were herding our sheep near them.
7796	8	25	17	25	17	Now consider carefully what you must do, because disaster looms over our master and all his household. For he is such a scoundrel that nobody can speak to him!”
7797	8	25	18	25	18	Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs. She loaded them on donkeys
7798	8	25	19	25	19	and said to her young men, “Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
7799	8	25	20	25	20	As Abigail came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming down toward her, and she met them.
7800	8	25	21	25	21	Now David had just finished saying, “In vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the wilderness. Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing, yet he has paid me back evil for good.
7801	8	25	22	25	22	May God punish David, and ever so severely, if I let one of Nabal’s men survive until morning.”
7802	8	25	23	25	23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey, fell facedown, and bowed before him.
7803	8	25	24	25	24	She fell at his feet and said, “My lord, may the blame be on me alone, but please let your servant speak to you; hear the words of your servant.
7804	8	25	25	25	25	My lord should pay no attention to this worthless man Nabal, for he lives up to his name: His name means Fool, and folly accompanies him. I, your servant, did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent.
7805	8	25	26	25	26	Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, the LORD has held you back from coming to bloodshed and avenging yourself with your own hand. May your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal.
7806	8	25	27	25	27	Now let this gift your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow you.
7807	8	25	28	25	28	Please forgive your servant’s offense, for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord, because he fights the LORD’s battles. May no evil be found in you as long as you live.
7808	8	25	29	25	29	And should someone pursue you and seek your life, then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the LORD your God in the bundle of the living. But He shall fling away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling.
7809	8	25	30	25	30	When the LORD has done for my lord all the good He promised, and when He has appointed you ruler over Israel,
7810	8	25	31	25	31	then my lord will have no remorse or guilt of conscience over needless bloodshed and revenge. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, may you remember your maidservant.”
7811	8	25	32	25	32	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day!
7812	8	25	33	25	33	Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you, because today you kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.
7813	8	25	34	25	34	Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, then surely no male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by morning light.”
7814	8	25	35	25	35	Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him, and he said to her, “Go home in peace. See, I have heeded your voice and granted your request.”
7815	8	25	36	25	36	When Abigail returned to Nabal, there he was in the house, holding a feast fit for a king, in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until morning light.
7816	8	25	37	25	37	In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him about these events, and his heart failed within him and he became like a stone.
7817	8	25	38	25	38	About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal dead.
7818	8	25	39	25	39	On hearing that Nabal was dead, David said, “Blessed be the LORD who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal and has restrained His servant from evil. For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.” Then David sent word to Abigail, asking for her in marriage.
7819	8	25	40	25	40	When his servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to take you as his wife.”
7820	8	25	41	25	41	She arose, then bowed facedown and said, “Here is your maidservant, ready to serve and to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”
7821	8	25	42	25	42	So Abigail hurried and got on a donkey, and attended by five of her maidens, she followed David’s messengers and became his wife.
7822	8	25	43	25	43	David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel. So she and Abigail were both his wives.
7823	8	25	44	25	44	But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
7824	8	26	1	26	1	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?”
7825	8	26	2	26	2	So Saul, accompanied by three thousand choice men of Israel, went down to the Wilderness of Ziph to search for David there.
7826	8	26	3	26	3	Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon, but David was living in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had followed him there,
7827	8	26	4	26	4	David sent out spies to verify that Saul had arrived.
7828	8	26	5	26	5	Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him.
7829	8	26	6	26	6	And David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” “I will go with you,” answered Abishai.
7830	8	26	7	26	7	That night David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the troops were lying around him.
7831	8	26	8	26	8	Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. Now, therefore, please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke. I will not need to strike him twice!”
7832	8	26	9	26	9	But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the LORD’s anointed and be guiltless?”
7833	8	26	10	26	10	David added, “As surely as the LORD lives, the LORD Himself will strike him down; either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
7834	8	26	11	26	11	But the LORD forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.”
7835	8	26	12	26	12	So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.
7836	8	26	13	26	13	Then David crossed to the other side and stood atop the mountain at a distance; there was a wide gulf between them.
7837	8	26	14	26	14	And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Will you not answer me, Abner?” “Who calls to the king?” Abner replied.
7838	8	26	15	26	15	So David said to Abner, “You are a man, aren’t you? And who in Israel is your equal? Why then did you not protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him?
7839	8	26	16	26	16	This thing you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?”
7840	8	26	17	26	17	Then Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” “It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said.
7841	8	26	18	26	18	And he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?
7842	8	26	19	26	19	Now please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then may He accept an offering. But if men have done it, may they be cursed in the presence of the LORD! For today they have driven me away from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’
7843	8	26	20	26	20	So do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
7844	8	26	21	26	21	Then Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. I will never harm you again, because today you considered my life precious. I have played the fool and have committed a grave error!”
7845	8	26	22	26	22	“Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of the young men come over and get it.
7846	8	26	23	26	23	May the LORD repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. For the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.
7847	8	26	24	26	24	As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and rescue me from all trouble.”
7848	8	26	25	26	25	Saul said to him, “May you be blessed, David my son. You will accomplish great things and will surely prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
7849	8	27	1	27	1	David, however, said to himself, “One of these days now I will be swept away by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will stop searching for me all over Israel, and I will slip out of his hand.”
7850	8	27	2	27	2	So David set out with his six hundred men and went to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
7851	8	27	3	27	3	David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.
7852	8	27	4	27	4	And when Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
7853	8	27	5	27	5	Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your eyes, let me be assigned a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. For why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
7854	8	27	6	27	6	That day Achish gave him Ziklag, and to this day it still belongs to the kings of Judah.
7855	8	27	7	27	7	And the time that David lived in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months.
7856	8	27	8	27	8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these people had inhabited the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)
7857	8	27	9	27	9	Whenever David attacked a territory, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and clothing. Then he would return to Achish,
7858	8	27	10	27	10	who would ask him, “What have you raided today?” And David would reply, “The Negev of Judah,” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel,” or “The Negev of the Kenites.”
7859	8	27	11	27	11	David did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Otherwise they will report us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” And this was David’s custom the whole time he lived in Philistine territory.
7860	8	27	12	27	12	So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since he has made himself repugnant to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever.”
7861	8	28	1	28	1	Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for warfare against Israel. So Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men are to go out to battle with me.”
7862	8	28	2	28	2	David replied, “Then you will come to know what your servant can do.” “Very well,” said Achish. “I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
7863	8	28	3	28	3	Now by this time Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.
7864	8	28	4	28	4	The Philistines came together and camped at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and camped at Gilboa.
7865	8	28	5	28	5	When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and trembled violently.
7866	8	28	6	28	6	He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.
7867	8	28	7	28	7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.” “There is a medium at Endor,” his servants replied.
7868	8	28	8	28	8	So Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes, and he set out with two of his men. They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me. Bring up for me the one I name.”
7869	8	28	9	28	9	But the woman replied, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land. Why have you set a trap to get me killed?”
7870	8	28	10	28	10	Then Saul swore to her by the LORD: “As surely as the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this.”
7871	8	28	11	28	11	“Whom shall I bring up for you?” the woman asked. “Bring up Samuel,” he replied.
7872	8	28	12	28	12	But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
7873	8	28	13	28	13	“Do not be afraid,” the king replied. “What do you see?” “I see a god coming up out of the earth,” the woman answered.
7874	8	28	14	28	14	“What does he look like?” asked Saul. “An old man is coming up,” she replied. “And he is wearing a robe.” So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown in reverence.
7875	8	28	15	28	15	Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” “I am deeply distressed,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”
7876	8	28	16	28	16	“Why do you consult me,” asked Samuel, “since the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?
7877	8	28	17	28	17	He has done exactly what He spoke through me: The LORD has torn the kingship out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David.
7878	8	28	18	28	18	Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out His burning anger against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today.
7879	8	28	19	28	19	Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And the LORD will deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”
7880	8	28	20	28	20	Immediately Saul fell flat on the ground, terrified by the words of Samuel. And his strength was gone, because he had not eaten anything all that day and night.
7881	8	28	21	28	21	When the woman came to Saul and saw how distraught he was, she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice. I took my life in my hands and did as you told me.
7882	8	28	22	28	22	Now please listen to your servant and let me set a morsel of bread before you so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”
7883	8	28	23	28	23	Saul refused, saying, “I will not eat.” But his servants joined the woman in urging him, and he heeded their voice. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
7884	8	28	24	28	24	The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
7885	8	28	25	28	25	She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. And that night they got up and left.
7886	8	29	1	29	1	Now the Philistines brought all their forces together at Aphek, while Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.
7887	8	29	2	29	2	As the Philistine leaders marched out their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men marched behind them with Achish.
7888	8	29	3	29	3	Then the commanders of the Philistines asked, “What about these Hebrews?” Achish replied, “Is this not David, the servant of King Saul of Israel? He has been with me all these days, even years, and from the day he defected until today I have found no fault in him.”
7889	8	29	4	29	4	But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with Achish and told him, “Send that man back and let him return to the place you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle only to become our adversary during the war. What better way for him to regain the favor of his master than with the heads of our men?
7890	8	29	5	29	5	Is this not the David about whom they sing in their dances: ‘Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands’?”
7891	8	29	6	29	6	So Achish summoned David and told him, “As surely as the LORD lives, you have been upright in my sight, and it seems right that you should march in and out with me in the army, because I have found no fault in you from the day you came to me until this day. But you have no favor in the sight of the leaders.
7892	8	29	7	29	7	Therefore turn back now and go in peace, so that you will not do anything to displease the leaders of the Philistines.”
7893	8	29	8	29	8	“But what have I done?” David replied. “What have you found against your servant, from the day I came to you until today, to keep me from going along to fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
7894	8	29	9	29	9	Achish replied, “I know that you are as pleasing in my sight as an angel of God. But the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go into battle with us.’
7895	8	29	10	29	10	Now then, get up early in the morning, along with your master’s servants who came with you, and go as soon as it is light.”
7896	8	29	11	29	11	So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
7897	8	30	1	30	1	On the third day David and his men arrived in Ziklag, and the Amalekites had raided the Negev, attacked Ziklag, and burned it down.
7898	8	30	2	30	2	They had taken captive the women and all who were there, both young and old. They had not killed anyone, but had carried them off as they went on their way.
7899	8	30	3	30	3	When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
7900	8	30	4	30	4	So David and the troops with him lifted up their voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep.
7901	8	30	5	30	5	David’s two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had been taken captive.
7902	8	30	6	30	6	And David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of every man grieved for his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
7903	8	30	7	30	7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought it to him,
7904	8	30	8	30	8	and David inquired of the LORD: “Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them?” “Pursue them,” the LORD replied, “for you will surely overtake them and rescue the captives.”
7905	8	30	9	30	9	So David and his six hundred men went to the Brook of Besor, where some stayed behind
7906	8	30	10	30	10	because two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the brook. But David and four hundred men continued in pursuit.
7907	8	30	11	30	11	Now his men found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David. They gave the man water to drink and food to eat—
7908	8	30	12	30	12	a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. So he ate and was revived, for he had not had any food or water for three days and three nights.
7909	8	30	13	30	13	Then David asked him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” “I am an Egyptian,” he replied, “the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago when I fell ill.
7910	8	30	14	30	14	We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory of Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag.”
7911	8	30	15	30	15	“Will you lead me to these raiders?” David asked. And the man replied, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will lead you to them.”
7912	8	30	16	30	16	So he led David down, and there were the Amalekites spread out over all the land, eating, drinking, and celebrating the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah.
7913	8	30	17	30	17	And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man escaped, except four hundred young men who fled, riding off on camels.
7914	8	30	18	30	18	So David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
7915	8	30	19	30	19	Nothing was missing, young or old, son or daughter, or any of the plunder the Amalekites had taken. David brought everything back.
7916	8	30	20	30	20	And he recovered all the flocks and herds, which his men drove ahead of the other livestock, calling out, “This is David’s plunder!”
7917	8	30	21	30	21	When David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him from the Brook of Besor, they came out to meet him and the troops with him. As David approached the men, he greeted them,
7918	8	30	22	30	22	but all the wicked and worthless men among those who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered, except for each man’s wife and children. They may take them and go.”
7919	8	30	23	30	23	But David said, “My brothers, you must not do this with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiders who came against us.
7920	8	30	24	30	24	Who will listen to your proposal? The share of the one who went to battle will match the share of the one who stayed with the supplies. They will share alike.”
7921	8	30	25	30	25	And so it has been from that day forward. David established this statute as an ordinance for Israel to this very day.
7922	8	30	26	30	26	When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD’s enemies.”
7923	8	30	27	30	27	He sent gifts to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir;
7924	8	30	28	30	28	to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa;
7925	8	30	29	30	29	to those in Racal and in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites;
7926	8	30	30	30	30	to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and Athach;
7927	8	30	31	30	31	and to those in Hebron and in all the places where David and his men had roamed.
7928	8	31	1	31	1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
7929	8	31	2	31	2	The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
7930	8	31	3	31	3	When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him critically.
7931	8	31	4	31	4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through and torture me!” But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
7932	8	31	5	31	5	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him.
7933	8	31	6	31	6	So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together that same day.
7934	8	31	7	31	7	When the Israelites along the valley and those on the other side of the Jordan saw that the army of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities.
7935	8	31	8	31	8	The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
7936	8	31	9	31	9	They cut off Saul’s head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people.
7937	8	31	10	31	10	They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan.
7938	8	31	11	31	11	When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
7939	8	31	12	31	12	all their men of valor set out, journeyed all night, and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. When they arrived at Jabesh, they burned the bodies there.
7940	8	31	13	31	13	Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
7941	9	1	1	1	1	After the death of Saul, David returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
7942	9	1	2	1	2	On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him homage.
7943	9	1	3	1	3	“Where have you come from?” David asked. “I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he replied.
7944	9	1	4	1	4	“What was the outcome?” David asked. “Please tell me.” “The troops fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
7945	9	1	5	1	5	Then David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
7946	9	1	6	1	6	“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him.
7947	9	1	7	1	7	When he turned around and saw me, he called out and I answered, ‘Here I am!’
7948	9	1	8	1	8	‘Who are you?’ he asked. So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
7949	9	1	9	1	9	Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me but my life still lingers.’
7950	9	1	10	1	10	So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
7951	9	1	11	1	11	Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same.
7952	9	1	12	1	12	They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
7953	9	1	13	1	13	And David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, “Where are you from?” “I am the son of a foreigner,” he answered. “I am an Amalekite.”
7954	9	1	14	1	14	So David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?”
7955	9	1	15	1	15	Then David summoned one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him!” So the young man struck him down, and he died.
7956	9	1	16	1	16	For David had said to the Amalekite, “Your blood be on your own head because your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I killed the LORD’s anointed.’”
7957	9	1	17	1	17	Then David took up this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,
7958	9	1	18	1	18	and he ordered that the sons of Judah be taught the Song of the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar:
7959	9	1	19	1	19	“Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
7960	9	1	20	1	20	Tell it not in Gath; proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, and the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
7961	9	1	21	1	21	O mountains of Gilboa, may you have no dew or rain, no fields yielding offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.
7962	9	1	22	1	22	From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not retreat, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.
7963	9	1	23	1	23	Saul and Jonathan, beloved and delightful in life, were not divided in death. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
7964	9	1	24	1	24	O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and luxury, who decked your garments with ornaments of gold.
7965	9	1	25	1	25	How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
7966	9	1	26	1	26	I grieve for you, Jonathan, my brother. You were delightful to me; your love to me was extraordinary, surpassing the love of women.
7967	9	1	27	1	27	How the mighty have fallen and the weapons of war have perished!”
7968	9	2	1	2	1	Some time later, David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up to one of the towns of Judah?” “Go up,” the LORD answered. Then David asked, “Where should I go?” “To Hebron,” replied the LORD.
7969	9	2	2	2	2	So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
7970	9	2	3	2	3	David also took the men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns near Hebron.
7971	9	2	4	2	4	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.”
7972	9	2	5	2	5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead to tell them, “The LORD bless you, because you showed this kindness to Saul your lord when you buried him.
7973	9	2	6	2	6	Now may the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness, and I will also show you the same favor because you have done this.
7974	9	2	7	2	7	Now then, be strong and courageous, for though Saul your lord is dead, the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.”
7975	9	2	8	2	8	Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, took Saul’s son Ish-bosheth, moved him to Mahanaim,
7976	9	2	9	2	9	and made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin—over all Israel.
7977	9	2	10	2	10	Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.
7978	9	2	11	2	11	And the length of time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
7979	9	2	12	2	12	One day Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
7980	9	2	13	2	13	So Joab son of Zeruiah, along with the servants of David, marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. And the two camps took up positions on opposite sides of the pool.
7981	9	2	14	2	14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let us have the young men get up and compete before us.” “Let them get up,” Joab replied.
7982	9	2	15	2	15	So they got up and were counted off—twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.
7983	9	2	16	2	16	Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side, and they all fell together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is called Helkath-hazzurim.
7984	9	2	17	2	17	The battle that day was intense, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the servants of David.
7985	9	2	18	2	18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was fleet of foot like a wild gazelle,
7986	9	2	19	2	19	and he chased Abner, not turning to the right or to the left in his pursuit.
7987	9	2	20	2	20	And Abner glanced back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” “It is,” Asahel replied.
7988	9	2	21	2	21	So Abner told him, “Turn to your right or to your left, seize one of the young men, and take his equipment for yourself.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
7989	9	2	22	2	22	Once again, Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I show my face to your brother Joab?”
7990	9	2	23	2	23	But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach, and it came out his back, and he fell dead on the spot. And every man paused when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
7991	9	2	24	2	24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
7992	9	2	25	2	25	The Benjamites rallied to Abner, formed a single unit, and took their stand atop a hill.
7993	9	2	26	2	26	Then Abner called out to Joab: “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not realize that this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?”
7994	9	2	27	2	27	“As surely as God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken up, the troops would have continued pursuing their brothers until morning.”
7995	9	2	28	2	28	So Joab blew the ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight.
7996	9	2	29	2	29	And all that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning, and arrived at Mahanaim.
7997	9	2	30	2	30	When Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the troops. In addition to Asahel, nineteen of David’s servants were missing,
7998	9	2	31	2	31	but they had struck down 360 Benjamites who were with Abner.
7999	9	2	32	2	32	Later, they took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at daybreak.
8000	9	3	1	3	1	Now the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was protracted. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
8001	9	3	2	3	2	And sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel;
8002	9	3	3	3	3	his second was Chileab, by Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel; his third was Absalom, the son of Maacah daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
8003	9	3	4	3	4	his fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith; his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital;
8004	9	3	5	3	5	and his sixth was Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron.
8005	9	3	6	3	6	During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had continued to strengthen his position in the house of Saul.
8006	9	3	7	3	7	Meanwhile, Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner, “Why did you sleep with my father’s concubine?”
8007	9	3	8	3	8	Abner was furious over Ish-bosheth’s accusation. “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah?” he asked. “All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends. I have not delivered you into the hand of David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this woman!
8008	9	3	9	3	9	May God punish Abner, and ever so severely, if I do not do for David as the LORD has sworn to him,
8009	9	3	10	3	10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”
8010	9	3	11	3	11	And for fear of Abner, Ish-bosheth did not dare to say another word to him.
8011	9	3	12	3	12	Then Abner sent messengers in his place to say to David, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and surely my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over to you.”
8012	9	3	13	3	13	“Good,” replied David, “I will make a covenant with you. But there is one thing I require of you: Do not appear before me unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you come to see me.”
8013	9	3	14	3	14	Then David sent messengers to say to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, “Give me back my wife, Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
8014	9	3	15	3	15	So Ish-bosheth sent and took Michal from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.
8015	9	3	16	3	16	Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back.” So he returned home.
8016	9	3	17	3	17	Now Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, “In the past you sought David as your king.
8017	9	3	18	3	18	Now take action, because the LORD has said to David, ‘Through My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and of all their enemies.’”
8018	9	3	19	3	19	Abner also spoke to the Benjamites and went to Hebron to tell David all that seemed good to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin.
8019	9	3	20	3	20	When Abner and twenty of his men came to David at Hebron, David held a feast for them.
8020	9	3	21	3	21	Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at once, and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he went in peace.
8021	9	3	22	3	22	Just then David’s soldiers and Joab returned from a raid, bringing with them a great plunder. But Abner was not with David in Hebron because David had sent him on his way in peace.
8022	9	3	23	3	23	When Joab and all his troops arrived, he was informed, “Abner son of Ner came to see the king, who sent him on his way in peace.”
8023	9	3	24	3	24	So Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now he is getting away!
8024	9	3	25	3	25	Surely you realize that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to track your movements and all that you are doing.”
8025	9	3	26	3	26	As soon as Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David was unaware of it.
8026	9	3	27	3	27	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside into the gateway, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died on account of the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel.
8027	9	3	28	3	28	Afterward, David heard about this and said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
8028	9	3	29	3	29	May it whirl over the heads of Joab and the entire house of his father, and may the house of Joab never be without one having a discharge or skin disease, or one who leans on a staff or falls by the sword or lacks food.”
8029	9	3	30	3	30	(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
8030	9	3	31	3	31	Then David ordered Joab and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier.
8031	9	3	32	3	32	When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb, and all the people wept.
8032	9	3	33	3	33	And the king sang this lament for Abner: “Should Abner die the death of a fool?
8033	9	3	34	3	34	Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. As a man falls before the wicked, so also you fell.” And all the people wept over him even more.
8034	9	3	35	3	35	Then all the people came and urged David to eat something while it was still day, but David took an oath, saying, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!”
8035	9	3	36	3	36	All the people took note and were pleased. In fact, everything the king did pleased them.
8036	9	3	37	3	37	So on that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
8037	9	3	38	3	38	Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not realize that a great prince has fallen today in Israel?
8038	9	3	39	3	39	And I am weak this day, though anointed as king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil!”
8039	9	4	1	4	1	Now when Ish-bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was dismayed.
8040	9	4	2	4	2	Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,
8041	9	4	3	4	3	because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as foreigners to this day.
8042	9	4	4	4	4	And Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was hurrying to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
8043	9	4	5	4	5	Now Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while the king was taking his midday nap.
8044	9	4	6	4	6	They entered the interior of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
8045	9	4	7	4	7	They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed, and having stabbed and killed him, they beheaded him, took his head, and traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
8046	9	4	8	4	8	They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. Today the LORD has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.”
8047	9	4	9	4	9	But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,
8048	9	4	10	4	10	when someone told me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was a bearer of good news, I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was his reward for his news!
8049	9	4	11	4	11	How much more, when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house and on his own bed, shall I not now require his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth!”
8050	9	4	12	4	12	So David commanded his young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron, but they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
8051	9	5	1	5	1	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
8052	9	5	2	5	2	Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’”
8053	9	5	3	5	3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel.
8054	9	5	4	5	4	David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.
8055	9	5	5	5	5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
8056	9	5	6	5	6	Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.”
8057	9	5	7	5	7	Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
8058	9	5	8	5	8	On that day he said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David.” That is why it is said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.”
8059	9	5	9	5	9	So David took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces inward.
8060	9	5	10	5	10	And David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of Hosts was with him.
8061	9	5	11	5	11	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
8062	9	5	12	5	12	And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
8063	9	5	13	5	13	After he had arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
8064	9	5	14	5	14	These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
8065	9	5	15	5	15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
8066	9	5	16	5	16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
8067	9	5	17	5	17	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went down to the stronghold.
8068	9	5	18	5	18	Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
8069	9	5	19	5	19	So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
8070	9	5	20	5	20	So David went to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that place Baal-perazim.
8071	9	5	21	5	21	There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away.
8072	9	5	22	5	22	Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
8073	9	5	23	5	23	So David inquired of the LORD, who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
8074	9	5	24	5	24	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because this will mean that the LORD has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
8075	9	5	25	5	25	So David did as the LORD had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
8076	9	6	1	6	1	David again assembled the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand in all.
8077	9	6	2	6	2	And he and all his troops set out for Baale of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name—the name of the LORD of Hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on it.
8078	9	6	3	6	3	They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart,
8079	9	6	4	6	4	bringing with it the ark of God. And Ahio was walking in front of the ark.
8080	9	6	5	6	5	David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood instruments, harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
8081	9	6	6	6	6	When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen had stumbled.
8082	9	6	7	6	7	And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence, and he died there beside the ark of God.
8083	9	6	8	6	8	Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is called to this day.
8084	9	6	9	6	9	That day David feared the LORD and asked, “How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?”
8085	9	6	10	6	10	So he was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
8086	9	6	11	6	11	Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and all his household.
8087	9	6	12	6	12	Now it was reported to King David, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and had the ark of God brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing.
8088	9	6	13	6	13	When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
8089	9	6	14	6	14	And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced with all his might before the LORD,
8090	9	6	15	6	15	while he and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sounding of the ram’s horn.
8091	9	6	16	6	16	As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.
8092	9	6	17	6	17	So they brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
8093	9	6	18	6	18	When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts.
8094	9	6	19	6	19	Then he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. And all the people departed, each for his own home.
8095	9	6	20	6	20	As soon as David returned home to bless his own household, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!” she said. “He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do.”
8096	9	6	21	6	21	But David said to Michal, “I was dancing before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house when He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD,
8097	9	6	22	6	22	and I will humiliate and humble myself even more than this. Yet I will be honored by the maidservants of whom you have spoken.”
8098	9	6	23	6	23	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
8099	9	7	1	7	1	After the king had settled into his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
8100	9	7	2	7	2	he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.”
8101	9	7	3	7	3	And Nathan replied to the king, “Go and do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”
8102	9	7	4	7	4	But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
8103	9	7	5	7	5	“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in?
8104	9	7	6	7	6	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved about with a tent as My dwelling.
8105	9	7	7	7	7	In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people Israel, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’
8106	9	7	8	7	8	Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel.
8107	9	7	9	7	9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
8108	9	7	10	7	10	And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning
8109	9	7	11	7	11	and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD declares to you that He Himself will establish a house for you.
8110	9	7	12	7	12	And when your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.
8111	9	7	13	7	13	He will build a house for My Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
8112	9	7	14	7	14	I will be his Father, and he will be My son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men.
8113	9	7	15	7	15	But My loving devotion will never be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I moved out of your way.
8114	9	7	16	7	16	Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me, and your throne will be established forever.”
8115	9	7	17	7	17	So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision.
8116	9	7	18	7	18	Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
8117	9	7	19	7	19	And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, You have also spoken about the future of the house of Your servant. Is this Your custom with man, O Lord GOD?
8118	9	7	20	7	20	What more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD.
8119	9	7	21	7	21	For the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed it to Your servant.
8120	9	7	22	7	22	How great You are, O Lord GOD! For there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears.
8121	9	7	23	7	23	And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself and to make a name for Himself? You performed great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt.
8122	9	7	24	7	24	For You have established Your people Israel as Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.
8123	9	7	25	7	25	And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house. Do as You have promised,
8124	9	7	26	7	26	so that Your name will be magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.’ And the house of Your servant David will be established before You.
8125	9	7	27	7	27	For You, O LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant when You said, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Therefore Your servant has found the courage to offer this prayer to You.
8126	9	7	28	7	28	And now, O Lord GOD, You are God! Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
8127	9	7	29	7	29	Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing the house of Your servant will be blessed forever.”
8128	9	8	1	8	1	Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines.
8129	9	8	2	8	2	David also defeated the Moabites, made them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a cord. He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
8130	9	8	3	8	3	David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, who had marched out to restore his dominion along the Euphrates River.
8131	9	8	4	8	4	David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
8132	9	8	5	8	5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
8133	9	8	6	8	6	Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
8134	9	8	7	8	7	And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
8135	9	8	8	8	8	And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze.
8136	9	8	9	8	9	When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
8137	9	8	10	8	10	he sent his son Joram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze,
8138	9	8	11	8	11	and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued—
8139	9	8	12	8	12	from Edom and Moab, from the Ammonites and Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
8140	9	8	13	8	13	And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
8141	9	8	14	8	14	He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
8142	9	8	15	8	15	Thus David reigned over all Israel and administered justice and righteousness for all his people:
8143	9	8	16	8	16	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
8144	9	8	17	8	17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was the scribe;
8145	9	8	18	8	18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.
8146	9	9	1	9	1	Then David asked, “Is there anyone left from the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?”
8147	9	9	2	9	2	And there was a servant of Saul’s family named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king inquired, “Are you Ziba?” “I am your servant,” he replied.
8148	9	9	3	9	3	So the king asked, “Is there anyone left of Saul’s family to whom I can show the kindness of God?” Ziba answered, “There is still Jonathan’s son, who is lame in both feet.”
8149	9	9	4	9	4	“Where is he?” replied the king. And Ziba said, “Indeed, he is in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.”
8150	9	9	5	9	5	So King David had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
8151	9	9	6	9	6	And when Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he fell facedown in reverence. Then David said, “Mephibosheth!” “I am your servant,” he replied.
8152	9	9	7	9	7	“Do not be afraid,” said David, “for surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
8153	9	9	8	9	8	Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog like me?”
8154	9	9	9	9	9	Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “I have given to your master’s grandson all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
8155	9	9	10	9	10	You and your sons and servants are to work the ground for him and bring in the harvest, so that your master’s grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
8156	9	9	11	9	11	And Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all that my lord the king has commanded.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table like one of the king’s sons.
8157	9	9	12	9	12	And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.
8158	9	9	13	9	13	So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table, and he was lame in both feet.
8159	9	10	1	10	1	Some time later, the king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son Hanun.
8160	9	10	2	10	2	And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent some of his servants to console Hanun concerning his father. But when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
8161	9	10	3	10	3	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Has not David instead sent his servants to explore the city, spy it out, and overthrow it?”
8162	9	10	4	10	4	So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.
8163	9	10	5	10	5	When this was reported to David, he sent messengers to meet the men, since they had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”
8164	9	10	6	10	6	When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba, as well as a thousand men from the king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Tob.
8165	9	10	7	10	7	On hearing of this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.
8166	9	10	8	10	8	The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
8167	9	10	9	10	9	When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans.
8168	9	10	10	10	10	And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites.
8169	9	10	11	10	11	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue.
8170	9	10	12	10	12	Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.”
8171	9	10	13	10	13	So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him.
8172	9	10	14	10	14	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
8173	9	10	15	10	15	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped.
8174	9	10	16	10	16	Hadadezer sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
8175	9	10	17	10	17	When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and went to Helam. Then the Arameans arrayed themselves against David and fought against him.
8176	9	10	18	10	18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, who died there.
8177	9	10	19	10	19	When all the kings who were subject to Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
8178	9	11	1	11	1	In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, David sent Joab with his servants and the whole army of Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
8179	9	11	2	11	2	One evening David got up from his bed and strolled around on the roof of the palace. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing—a very beautiful woman.
8180	9	11	3	11	3	So David sent and inquired about the woman, and he was told, “This is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.”
8181	9	11	4	11	4	Then David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. (Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned home.
8182	9	11	5	11	5	And the woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”
8183	9	11	6	11	6	At this, David sent orders to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David.
8184	9	11	7	11	7	When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the troops were doing with the war.
8185	9	11	8	11	8	Then he said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him.
8186	9	11	9	11	9	But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master’s servants; he did not go down to his house.
8187	9	11	10	11	10	And David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” “Haven’t you just arrived from a journey?” David asked Uriah. “Why didn’t you go home?”
8188	9	11	11	11	11	Uriah answered, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field. How can I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing!”
8189	9	11	12	11	12	“Stay here one more day,” David said to Uriah, “and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
8190	9	11	13	11	13	Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him, and he got Uriah drunk. And in the evening Uriah went out to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants, but he did not go home.
8191	9	11	14	11	14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
8192	9	11	15	11	15	In the letter he wrote: “Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle; then withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and killed.”
8193	9	11	16	11	16	So as Joab besieged the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he saw the strongest enemy soldiers.
8194	9	11	17	11	17	And when the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of David’s servants fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died.
8195	9	11	18	11	18	Joab sent to David a full account of the battle
8196	9	11	19	11	19	and instructed the messenger, “When you have finished giving the king all the details of the battle,
8197	9	11	20	11	20	if the king’s anger flares, he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Did you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall?
8198	9	11	21	11	21	Who was the one to strike Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ If so, then you are to say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.’”
8199	9	11	22	11	22	So the messenger set out and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to say.
8200	9	11	23	11	23	The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
8201	9	11	24	11	24	Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s servants were killed. And your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.”
8202	9	11	25	11	25	Then David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Do not let this matter upset you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city and demolish it.’ Encourage him with these words.”
8203	9	11	26	11	26	When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
8204	9	11	27	11	27	And when the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD.
8205	9	12	1	12	1	Then the LORD sent Nathan to David, and when he arrived, he said, “There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor.
8206	9	12	2	12	2	The rich man had a great number of sheep and cattle,
8207	9	12	3	12	3	but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food and drank from his cup; it slept in his arms and was like a daughter to him.
8208	9	12	4	12	4	Now a traveler came to the rich man, who refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for his guest.”
8209	9	12	5	12	5	David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan: “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
8210	9	12	6	12	6	Because he has done this thing and has shown no pity, he must pay for the lamb four times over.”
8211	9	12	7	12	7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are that man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
8212	9	12	8	12	8	I gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more.
8213	9	12	9	12	9	Why then have you despised the command of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife as your own, for you have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.
8214	9	12	10	12	10	Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’
8215	9	12	11	12	11	This is what the LORD says: ‘I will raise up adversity against you from your own house. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to another, and he will lie with them in broad daylight.
8216	9	12	12	12	12	You have acted in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’”
8217	9	12	13	12	13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” “The LORD has taken away your sin,” Nathan replied. “You will not die.
8218	9	12	14	12	14	Nevertheless, because by this deed you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD, the son born to you will surely die.”
8219	9	12	15	12	15	After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he became ill.
8220	9	12	16	12	16	David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted and went into his house and spent the night lying in sackcloth on the ground.
8221	9	12	17	12	17	The elders of his household stood beside him to help him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them.
8222	9	12	18	12	18	On the seventh day the child died. But David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to us. So how can we tell him the child is dead? He may even harm himself.”
8223	9	12	19	12	19	When David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, he perceived that the child was dead. So he asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” “He is dead,” they replied.
8224	9	12	20	12	20	Then David got up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they set food before him, and he ate.
8225	9	12	21	12	21	“What is this you have done?” his servants asked. “While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate.”
8226	9	12	22	12	22	David answered, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let him live.’
8227	9	12	23	12	23	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”
8228	9	12	24	12	24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. So she gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. Now the LORD loved the child
8229	9	12	25	12	25	and sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah because the LORD loved him.
8230	9	12	26	12	26	Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal fortress.
8231	9	12	27	12	27	Then Joab sent messengers to David to say, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the water supply of the city.
8232	9	12	28	12	28	Now, therefore, assemble the rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise I will capture the city, and it will be named after me.”
8233	9	12	29	12	29	So David assembled all the troops and went to Rabbah; and he fought against it and captured it.
8234	9	12	30	12	30	Then he took the crown from the head of their king. It weighed a talent of gold and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
8235	9	12	31	12	31	David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes, and he made them work at the brick kilns. He did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
8236	9	13	1	13	1	After some time, David’s son Amnon fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of David’s son Absalom.
8237	9	13	2	13	2	Amnon was sick with frustration over his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed implausible for him to do anything to her.
8238	9	13	3	13	3	Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah. Jonadab was a very shrewd man,
8239	9	13	4	13	4	so he asked Amnon, “Why are you, the son of the king, so depressed morning after morning? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon replied, “I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
8240	9	13	5	13	5	Jonadab told him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare it in my sight so I may watch her and eat it from her hand.’”
8241	9	13	6	13	6	So Amnon lay down and feigned illness. When the king came to see him, Amnon said, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.”
8242	9	13	7	13	7	Then David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare a meal for him.”
8243	9	13	8	13	8	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked them.
8244	9	13	9	13	9	Then she brought the pan and set it down before him, but he refused to eat. “Send everyone away!” said Amnon. And everyone went out.
8245	9	13	10	13	10	Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat it from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes she had made and went to her brother Amnon’s bedroom.
8246	9	13	11	13	11	And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”
8247	9	13	12	13	12	“No, my brother!” she cried. “Do not humiliate me, for such a thing should never be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!
8248	9	13	13	13	13	Where could I ever take my shame? And you would be like one of the fools in Israel! Please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
8249	9	13	14	13	14	But Amnon refused to listen to her, and being stronger, he violated her and lay with her.
8250	9	13	15	13	15	Then Amnon hated Tamar with such intensity that his hatred was greater than the love he previously had. “Get up!” he said to her. “Be gone!”
8251	9	13	16	13	16	“No,” she replied, “sending me away is worse than this great wrong you have already done to me!” But he refused to listen to her.
8252	9	13	17	13	17	Instead, he called to his attendant and said, “Throw this woman out and bolt the door behind her!”
8253	9	13	18	13	18	So Amnon’s attendant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a robe of many colors, because this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore.
8254	9	13	19	13	19	And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her robe. And putting her hand on her head, she went away crying bitterly.
8255	9	13	20	13	20	Her brother Absalom said to her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in the house of her brother Absalom.
8256	9	13	21	13	21	When King David heard all this, he was furious.
8257	9	13	22	13	22	And Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon for disgracing his sister Tamar.
8258	9	13	23	13	23	Two years later, when Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, he invited all the king’s sons.
8259	9	13	24	13	24	And he went to the king and said, “Your servant has just hired shearers. Will the king and his servants please come with me?”
8260	9	13	25	13	25	“No, my son,” the king replied, “we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he was not willing to go, but gave him his blessing.
8261	9	13	26	13	26	“If not,” said Absalom, “please let my brother Amnon go with us.” “Why should he go with you?” the king asked.
8262	9	13	27	13	27	But Absalom urged him, so he sent Amnon and the rest of the king’s sons.
8263	9	13	28	13	28	Now Absalom had ordered his young men, “Watch Amnon until his heart is merry with wine, and when I order you to strike Amnon down, you are to kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant!”
8264	9	13	29	13	29	So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had ordered. Then all the rest of the king’s sons got up, and each one fled on his mule.
8265	9	13	30	13	30	While they were on the way, a report reached David: “Absalom has struck down all the king’s sons; not one of them is left!”
8266	9	13	31	13	31	Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
8267	9	13	32	13	32	But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, spoke up: “My lord must not think they have killed all the sons of the king, for only Amnon is dead. In fact, Absalom has planned this since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar.
8268	9	13	33	13	33	So now, my lord the king, do not take to heart the report that all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”
8269	9	13	34	13	34	Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. When the young man standing watch looked up, he saw many people coming down the road west of him, along the side of the hill. (And the watchman went and reported to the king, “I see men coming from the direction of Horonaim, along the side of the hill.”)
8270	9	13	35	13	35	So Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons have arrived! It is just as your servant said.”
8271	9	13	36	13	36	And as he finished speaking, the king’s sons came in, wailing loudly. Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.
8272	9	13	37	13	37	Now Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But David mourned for his son every day.
8273	9	13	38	13	38	After Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, he stayed there three years.
8274	9	13	39	13	39	And King David longed to go to Absalom, for he had been consoled over Amnon’s death.
8275	9	14	1	14	1	Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart longed for Absalom.
8276	9	14	2	14	2	So Joab sent to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He told her, “Please pretend to be a mourner; put on clothes for mourning and do not anoint yourself with oil. Act like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time.
8277	9	14	3	14	3	Then go to the king and speak these words to him.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.
8278	9	14	4	14	4	When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell facedown in homage and said, “Help me, O king!”
8279	9	14	5	14	5	“What troubles you?” the king asked her. “Indeed,” she said, “I am a widow, for my husband is dead.
8280	9	14	6	14	6	And your maidservant had two sons who were fighting in the field with no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.
8281	9	14	7	14	7	Now the whole clan has risen up against your maidservant and said, ‘Hand over the one who struck down his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of the brother whom he killed. Then we will cut off the heir as well!’ So they would extinguish my one remaining ember by not preserving my husband’s name or posterity on the earth.”
8282	9	14	8	14	8	“Go home,” the king said to the woman, “and I will give orders on your behalf.”
8283	9	14	9	14	9	But the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, may any blame be on me and on my father’s house, and may the king and his throne be guiltless.”
8284	9	14	10	14	10	“If anyone speaks to you,” said the king, “bring him to me, and he will not trouble you again!”
8285	9	14	11	14	11	“Please,” she replied, “may the king invoke the LORD your God to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing the devastation, so that my son may not be destroyed!” “As surely as the LORD lives,” he vowed, “not a hair of your son’s head will fall to the ground.”
8286	9	14	12	14	12	Then the woman said, “Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?” “Speak,” he replied.
8287	9	14	13	14	13	The woman asked, “Why have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, since he has not brought back his own banished son?
8288	9	14	14	14	14	For surely we will die and be like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises ways that the banished one may not be cast out from Him.
8289	9	14	15	14	15	Now therefore, I have come to present this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king. Perhaps he will grant the request of his maidservant.
8290	9	14	16	14	16	For the king will hear and deliver his maidservant from the hand of the man who would cut off both me and my son from God’s inheritance.’
8291	9	14	17	14	17	And now your servant says, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is able to discern good and evil, just like the angel of God. May the LORD your God be with you.’”
8292	9	14	18	14	18	Then the king said to the woman, “I am going to ask you something; do not conceal it from me!” “Let my lord the king speak,” she replied.
8293	9	14	19	14	19	So the king asked, “Is the hand of Joab behind all this?” The woman answered, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave me orders; he told your maidservant exactly what to say.
8294	9	14	20	14	20	Joab your servant has done this to bring about this change of affairs, but my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that happens in the land.”
8295	9	14	21	14	21	Then the king said to Joab, “I hereby grant this request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”
8296	9	14	22	14	22	Joab fell facedown in homage and blessed the king. “Today,” said Joab, “your servant knows that he has found favor with you, my lord the king, because the king has granted his request.”
8297	9	14	23	14	23	So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
8298	9	14	24	14	24	But the king added, “He may return to his house, but he must not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, but he did not see the king.
8299	9	14	25	14	25	Now there was not a man in all Israel as handsome and highly praised as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.
8300	9	14	26	14	26	And when he cut the hair of his head—he shaved it every year because his hair got so heavy—he would weigh it out to be two hundred shekels, according to the royal standard.
8301	9	14	27	14	27	Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman.
8302	9	14	28	14	28	Now Absalom lived in Jerusalem two years without seeing the face of the king.
8303	9	14	29	14	29	Then he sent for Joab to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come. So Absalom sent the second time, but Joab still would not come.
8304	9	14	30	14	30	Then Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire!” And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
8305	9	14	31	14	31	Then Joab came to Absalom’s house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”
8306	9	14	32	14	32	“Look,” said Absalom, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”
8307	9	14	33	14	33	So Joab went and told the king, and David summoned Absalom, who came to him and bowed facedown before him. Then the king kissed Absalom.
8308	9	15	1	15	1	Some time later, Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses and fifty men to run ahead of him.
8309	9	15	2	15	2	He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out and ask, “What city are you from?” And if he replied, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,”
8310	9	15	3	15	3	Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king has no deputy to hear you.”
8311	9	15	4	15	4	And he would add, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land, then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would give him justice.”
8312	9	15	5	15	5	Also, when anyone approached to bow down to him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.
8313	9	15	6	15	6	Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for justice. In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
8314	9	15	7	15	7	After four years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to fulfill a vow I have made to the LORD.
8315	9	15	8	15	8	For your servant made a vow while dwelling in Geshur of Aram, saying: ‘If indeed the LORD brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron.’”
8316	9	15	9	15	9	“Go in peace,” said the king. So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.
8317	9	15	10	15	10	Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When you hear the sound of the horn, you are to say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’”
8318	9	15	11	15	11	Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and they went along innocently, for they knew nothing about the matter.
8319	9	15	12	15	12	While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, to come from his hometown of Giloh. So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept increasing.
8320	9	15	13	15	13	Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”
8321	9	15	14	15	14	And David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! We must leave quickly, or he will soon overtake us, heap disaster on us, and put the city to the sword.”
8322	9	15	15	15	15	The king’s servants replied, “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are your servants.”
8323	9	15	16	15	16	Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace.
8324	9	15	17	15	17	So the king set out with all the people following him. He stopped at the last house,
8325	9	15	18	15	18	and all his servants marched past him—all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath.
8326	9	15	19	15	19	Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the new king, since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.
8327	9	15	20	15	20	In fact, you arrived only yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.”
8328	9	15	21	15	21	But Ittai answered the king, “As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be!”
8329	9	15	22	15	22	“March on then,” said David to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
8330	9	15	23	15	23	Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly as all the people passed by. And as the king crossed the Kidron Valley, all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness.
8331	9	15	24	15	24	Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until the people had passed out of the city.
8332	9	15	25	15	25	Then the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back and let me see both it and His dwelling place again.
8333	9	15	26	15	26	But if He should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him.”
8334	9	15	27	15	27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace—you with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar with his son Jonathan.
8335	9	15	28	15	28	See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”
8336	9	15	29	15	29	So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there.
8337	9	15	30	15	30	But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.
8338	9	15	31	15	31	Now someone told David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” So David pleaded, “O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”
8339	9	15	32	15	32	When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head.
8340	9	15	33	15	33	David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
8341	9	15	34	15	34	But you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, my king; in the past I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant.’
8342	9	15	35	15	35	Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report to them everything you hear from the king’s palace.
8343	9	15	36	15	36	Indeed, their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with everything you hear.”
8344	9	15	37	15	37	So David’s friend Hushai arrived in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city.
8345	9	16	1	16	1	When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
8346	9	16	2	16	2	“Why do you have these?” asked the king. Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
8347	9	16	3	16	3	“Where is your master’s grandson?” asked the king. And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’”
8348	9	16	4	16	4	So the king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” “I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba. “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king!”
8349	9	16	5	16	5	As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses.
8350	9	16	6	16	6	He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and left.
8351	9	16	7	16	7	And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed!
8352	9	16	8	16	8	The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of bloodshed!”
8353	9	16	9	16	9	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!”
8354	9	16	10	16	10	But the king replied, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’”
8355	9	16	11	16	11	Then David said to Abishai and all his servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let him curse me, for the LORD has told him so.
8356	9	16	12	16	12	Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today.”
8357	9	16	13	16	13	So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David.
8358	9	16	14	16	14	Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived, exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
8359	9	16	15	16	15	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
8360	9	16	16	16	16	And David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
8361	9	16	17	16	17	“Is this the loyalty you show your friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?”
8362	9	16	18	16	18	“Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For the one chosen by the LORD, by the people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain.
8363	9	16	19	16	19	Furthermore, whom should I serve if not the son? As I served in your father’s presence, so also I will serve in yours.”
8364	9	16	20	16	20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me counsel. What should we do?”
8365	9	16	21	16	21	Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”
8366	9	16	22	16	22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
8367	9	16	23	16	23	Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice.
8368	9	17	1	17	1	Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.
8369	9	17	2	17	2	I will attack him while he is weak and weary; I will throw him into a panic, and all the people with him will flee; I will strike down only the king
8370	9	17	3	17	3	and bring all the people back to you. When everyone returns except the man you seek, all the people will be at peace.”
8371	9	17	4	17	4	This proposal seemed good to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
8372	9	17	5	17	5	Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the Archite as well, and let us hear what he too has to say.”
8373	9	17	6	17	6	So Hushai came to Absalom, who told him, “Ahithophel has spoken this proposal. Should we carry it out? If not, what do you say?”
8374	9	17	7	17	7	Hushai replied, “This time the advice of Ahithophel is not sound.”
8375	9	17	8	17	8	He continued, “You know your father and his men. They are mighty men, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Moreover, your father is a man of war who will not spend the night with the troops.
8376	9	17	9	17	9	Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or some other location. If some of your troops fall first, whoever hears of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.’
8377	9	17	10	17	10	Then even the most valiant soldier with the heart of a lion will melt with fear, because all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man who has valiant men with him.
8378	9	17	11	17	11	Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand on the seashore—be gathered to you, and that you yourself lead them into battle.
8379	9	17	12	17	12	Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. And of all the men with him, not even one will remain.
8380	9	17	13	17	13	If he retreats to a city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a pebble can be found.”
8381	9	17	14	17	14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
8382	9	17	15	17	15	So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised.
8383	9	17	16	17	16	Now send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the wilderness, but be sure to cross over. Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.’”
8384	9	17	17	17	17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, for they dared not be seen entering the city.
8385	9	17	18	17	18	But a young man did see them and told Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.
8386	9	17	19	17	19	Then the man’s wife took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, scattering grain over it so nobody would know a thing.
8387	9	17	20	17	20	When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” “They have crossed over the brook,” she replied. The men searched but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
8388	9	17	21	17	21	After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up out of the well and went to inform King David, saying, “Get up and cross over the river at once, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.”
8389	9	17	22	17	22	So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan.
8390	9	17	23	17	23	When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father’s tomb.
8391	9	17	24	17	24	Then David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
8392	9	17	25	17	25	Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, the Ishmaelite who had married Abigail daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
8393	9	17	26	17	26	So the Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
8394	9	17	27	17	27	When David came to Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.
8395	9	17	28	17	28	They brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
8396	9	17	29	17	29	honey, curds, sheep, and cheese from the herd for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.”
8397	9	18	1	18	1	Then David reviewed his troops and appointed over them commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
8398	9	18	2	18	2	He sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I will surely march out with you as well.”
8399	9	18	3	18	3	But the people pleaded, “You must not go out! For if we have to flee, they will pay no attention to us. Even if half of us die, they will not care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It is better for now if you support us from the city.”
8400	9	18	4	18	4	“I will do whatever seems best to you,” the king replied. So he stood beside the gate, while all the troops marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
8401	9	18	5	18	5	Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” And all the people heard the king’s orders to each of the commanders regarding Absalom.
8402	9	18	6	18	6	So David’s army marched into the field to engage Israel in the battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim.
8403	9	18	7	18	7	There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s servants, and the slaughter was great that day—twenty thousand men.
8404	9	18	8	18	8	The battle spread over the whole countryside, and that day the forest devoured more people than the sword.
8405	9	18	9	18	9	Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in midair.
8406	9	18	10	18	10	When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”
8407	9	18	11	18	11	“You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed. “Why did you not strike him to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a warrior’s belt!”
8408	9	18	12	18	12	The man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels of silver were weighed out into my hands, I would not raise my hand against the king’s son. For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’
8409	9	18	13	18	13	If I had jeopardized my own life—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have abandoned me.”
8410	9	18	14	18	14	But Joab declared, “I am not going to wait like this with you!” And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree.
8411	9	18	15	18	15	And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him.
8412	9	18	16	18	16	Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab had restrained them.
8413	9	18	17	18	17	They took Absalom, cast him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled, each to his home.
8414	9	18	18	18	18	During his lifetime, Absalom had set up for himself a pillar in the King’s Valley, for he had said, “I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he gave the pillar his name, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.
8415	9	18	19	18	19	Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.”
8416	9	18	20	18	20	But Joab replied, “You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.”
8417	9	18	21	18	21	So Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running.
8418	9	18	22	18	22	Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted and said to Joab, “Regardless of whatever may happen, please let me also run behind the Cushite!” “My son,” Joab replied, “why do you want to run, since you will not receive a reward?”
8419	9	18	23	18	23	“No matter what, I want to run!” he replied. “Then run!” Joab told him. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
8420	9	18	24	18	24	Now David was sitting between the two gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall, looked out, and saw a man running alone.
8421	9	18	25	18	25	So he called out and told the king. “If he is alone,” the king replied, “he bears good news.” As the first runner drew near,
8422	9	18	26	18	26	the watchman saw another man running, and he called out to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!” “This one also brings good news,” said the king.
8423	9	18	27	18	27	The watchman said, “The first man appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” “This is a good man,” said the king. “He comes with good news.”
8424	9	18	28	18	28	Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” And he bowed facedown before the king. He continued, “Blessed be the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.”
8425	9	18	29	18	29	The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was.”
8426	9	18	30	18	30	“Move aside,” said the king, “and stand here.” So he stepped aside.
8427	9	18	31	18	31	Just then the Cushite came and said, “May my lord the king hear the good news: Today the LORD has avenged you of all who rose up against you!”
8428	9	18	32	18	32	The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom all right?” And the Cushite replied, “May what has become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king and to all who rise up against you to harm you.”
8429	9	19	1	18	33	The king was shaken and went up to the gate chamber and wept. And as he walked, he cried out, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”
8430	9	19	2	19	1	Then it was reported to Joab, “The king is weeping and mourning over Absalom.”
8431	9	19	3	19	2	And that day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the people, because on that day they were told, “The king is grieving over his son.”
8432	9	19	4	19	3	So they returned to the city quietly that day, as people steal away in humiliation after fleeing a battle.
8433	9	19	5	19	4	But the king covered his face and cried out at the top of his voice, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”
8434	9	19	6	19	5	Then Joab went into the house and said to the king, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your wives, and of your concubines.
8435	9	19	7	19	6	You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! For you have made it clear today that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. I know today that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased you!
8436	9	19	8	19	7	Now therefore get up! Go out and speak comfort to your servants, for I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth until now!”
8437	9	19	9	19	8	So the king got up and sat in the gate, and all the people were told: “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” So they all came before the king. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled, each man to his home.
8438	9	19	10	19	9	And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel were arguing, “The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies and delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled the land because of Absalom.
8439	9	19	11	19	10	But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?”
8440	9	19	12	19	11	Then King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to restore the king to his palace, since the talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters?
8441	9	19	13	19	12	You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to restore the king?’
8442	9	19	14	19	13	And say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from this time you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’”
8443	9	19	15	19	14	So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man, and they sent word to the king: “Return, you and all your servants.”
8444	9	19	16	19	15	So the king returned, and when he arrived at the Jordan, the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the Jordan.
8445	9	19	17	19	16	Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David,
8446	9	19	18	19	17	along with a thousand men of Benjamin, as well as Ziba the steward of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan before the king
8447	9	19	19	19	18	and crossed at the ford to carry over the king’s household and to do what was good in his sight. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell down before the king
8448	9	19	20	19	19	and said, “My lord, do not hold me guilty, and do not remember your servant’s wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart.
8449	9	19	21	19	20	For your servant knows that I have sinned, so here I am today as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”
8450	9	19	22	19	21	But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?”
8451	9	19	23	19	22	And David replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, what have I to do with you, that you should be my adversaries today? Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Am I not indeed aware that today I am king over Israel?”
8452	9	19	24	19	23	So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” Then the king swore an oath to him.
8453	9	19	25	19	24	Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until the day he returned safely.
8454	9	19	26	19	25	And he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, who asked him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?”
8455	9	19	27	19	26	“My lord the king,” he replied, “because I am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ But my servant Ziba deceived me,
8456	9	19	28	19	27	and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. Yet my lord the king is like the angel of God, so do what is good in your eyes.
8457	9	19	29	19	28	For all the house of my grandfather deserves death from my lord the king, yet you have set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right, then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?”
8458	9	19	30	19	29	The king replied, “Why say any more? I hereby declare that you and Ziba are to divide the land.”
8459	9	19	31	19	30	And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Instead, since my lord the king has safely come to his own house, let Ziba take it all!”
8460	9	19	32	19	31	Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and send him on his way from there.
8461	9	19	33	19	32	Barzillai was quite old, eighty years of age, and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the king while he stayed in Mahanaim.
8462	9	19	34	19	33	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.”
8463	9	19	35	19	34	But Barzillai replied, “How many years of my life remain, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
8464	9	19	36	19	35	I am now eighty years old. Can I discern what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
8465	9	19	37	19	36	Your servant could go with the king only a short distance past the Jordan; why should the king repay me with such a reward?
8466	9	19	38	19	37	Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your sight.”
8467	9	19	39	19	38	The king replied, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good in your sight, and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.”
8468	9	19	40	19	39	So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned home.
8469	9	19	41	19	40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham crossed over with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king.
8470	9	19	42	19	41	Soon all the men of Israel came to the king and asked, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and bring the king and his household across the Jordan, together with all of David’s men?”
8471	9	19	43	19	42	And all the men of Judah replied to the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is our relative. Why does this anger you? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense or received anything for ourselves?”
8472	9	19	44	19	43	“We have ten shares in the king,” answered the men of Israel, “so we have more claim to David than you. Why then do you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of restoring our king?” But the men of Judah pressed even harder than the men of Israel.
8473	9	20	1	20	1	Now a worthless man named Sheba son of Bichri, a Benjamite, happened to be there, and he blew the ram’s horn and shouted: “We have no share in David, no inheritance in Jesse’s son. Every man to his tent, O Israel!”
8474	9	20	2	20	2	So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bichri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
8475	9	20	3	20	3	When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to care for the palace, and he placed them in a house under guard. He provided for them, but he no longer slept with them. They were confined until the day of their death, living as widows.
8476	9	20	4	20	4	Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.”
8477	9	20	5	20	5	So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time allotted him.
8478	9	20	6	20	6	And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and elude us.”
8479	9	20	7	20	7	So Joab’s men, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, marched out of Jerusalem in pursuit of Sheba son of Bichri.
8480	9	20	8	20	8	And while they were at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa joined them. Now Joab was dressed in military attire, with a dagger strapped to his belt. And as he stepped forward, he slipped the dagger from its sheath.
8481	9	20	9	20	9	“Are you well, my brother?” Joab asked Amasa. And with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him.
8482	9	20	10	20	10	Amasa was not on guard against the dagger in Joab’s hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach and spilled out his intestines on the ground. And Joab did not need to strike him again, for Amasa was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri.
8483	9	20	11	20	11	One of Joab’s young men stood near Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!”
8484	9	20	12	20	12	But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the road, and when the man saw that all the troops were stopping there, he dragged the body off the road into a field and threw a garment over it.
8485	9	20	13	20	13	As soon as Amasa’s body was removed from the road, all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
8486	9	20	14	20	14	Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel-Beth-Maacah and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him.
8487	9	20	15	20	15	And Joab’s troops came and besieged Sheba in Abel-Beth-Maacah and built a siege ramp against the outer rampart of the city. As all the troops with Joab were battering the wall to topple it,
8488	9	20	16	20	16	a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come here so that I may speak with him.”
8489	9	20	17	20	17	When he had come near to her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” “I am,” he replied. “Listen to the words of your servant,” she said. “I am listening,” he answered.
8490	9	20	18	20	18	Then the woman said, “Long ago they used to say, ‘Seek counsel at Abel,’ and that is how disputes were settled.
8491	9	20	19	20	19	I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel, but you are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the LORD’s inheritance?”
8492	9	20	20	20	20	“Far be it!” Joab declared. “Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!
8493	9	20	21	20	21	That is not the case. But a man named Sheba son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him alone, and I will depart from the city.” “Look,” the woman replied, “his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”
8494	9	20	22	20	22	Then the woman went to all the people with her wise counsel, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the ram’s horn and his men dispersed from the city, each to his own home. And Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.
8495	9	20	23	20	23	Now Joab was over the whole army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;
8496	9	20	24	20	24	Adoram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
8497	9	20	25	20	25	Sheva was the scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
8498	9	20	26	20	26	and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest.
8499	9	21	1	21	1	During the reign of David there was a famine for three successive years, and David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, “It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family, because he killed the Gibeonites.”
8500	9	21	2	21	2	At this, David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them, but in his zeal for Israel and Judah, Saul had sought to kill them.)
8501	9	21	3	21	3	So David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How can I make amends so that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?”
8502	9	21	4	21	4	The Gibeonites said to him, “We need no silver or gold from Saul or his house, nor should you put to death anyone in Israel for us.” “Whatever you ask, I will do for you,” he replied.
8503	9	21	5	21	5	And they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us to exterminate us from existing within any border of Israel,
8504	9	21	6	21	6	let seven of his male descendants be delivered to us so that we may hang them before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” “I will give them to you,” said the king.
8505	9	21	7	21	7	Now the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
8506	9	21	8	21	8	But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul, as well as the five sons whom Merab daughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
8507	9	21	9	21	9	And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD. So all seven of them fell together; they were put to death in the first days of the harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
8508	9	21	10	21	10	And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies, she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
8509	9	21	11	21	11	When David was told what Saul’s concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done,
8510	9	21	12	21	12	he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung the bodies after they had struck down Saul at Gilboa.
8511	9	21	13	21	13	So David had the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan brought from there, along with the bones of those who had been hanged.
8512	9	21	14	21	14	And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. After they had done everything the king had commanded, God answered their prayers for the land.
8513	9	21	15	21	15	Once again the Philistines waged war against Israel, and David and his servants went down and fought against the Philistines; but David became exhausted.
8514	9	21	16	21	16	Then Ishbi-benob, a descendant of Rapha, whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels and who was bearing a new sword, resolved to kill David.
8515	9	21	17	21	17	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, “You must never again go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel may not be extinguished.”
8516	9	21	18	21	18	Some time later at Gob, there was another battle with the Philistines. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.
8517	9	21	19	21	19	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
8518	9	21	20	21	20	And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,
8519	9	21	21	21	21	and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
8520	9	21	22	21	22	So these four descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.
8521	9	22	1	22	1	And David sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
8522	9	22	2	22	2	He said: “The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
8523	9	22	3	22	3	My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation. My stronghold, my refuge, and my Savior, You save me from violence.
8524	9	22	4	22	4	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.
8525	9	22	5	22	5	For the waves of death engulfed me; the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me.
8526	9	22	6	22	6	The cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
8527	9	22	7	22	7	In my distress I called upon the LORD; I cried out to my God. And from His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for help reached His ears.
8528	9	22	8	22	8	Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the heavens trembled; they were shaken because He burned with anger.
8529	9	22	9	22	9	Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; glowing coals flamed forth.
8530	9	22	10	22	10	He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds beneath His feet.
8531	9	22	11	22	11	He mounted a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind.
8532	9	22	12	22	12	He made darkness a canopy around Him, a gathering of water and thick clouds.
8533	9	22	13	22	13	From the brightness of His presence coals of fire blazed forth.
8534	9	22	14	22	14	The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
8535	9	22	15	22	15	He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; He hurled lightning and routed them.
8536	9	22	16	22	16	The channels of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
8537	9	22	17	22	17	He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters.
8538	9	22	18	22	18	He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, for they were too mighty for me.
8539	9	22	19	22	19	They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD was my support.
8540	9	22	20	22	20	He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
8541	9	22	21	22	21	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
8542	9	22	22	22	22	For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.
8543	9	22	23	22	23	For all His ordinances are before me; I have not disregarded His statutes.
8544	9	22	24	22	24	And I have been blameless before Him and kept myself from iniquity.
8545	9	22	25	22	25	So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in His sight.
8546	9	22	26	22	26	To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, and to the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
8547	9	22	27	22	27	to the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.
8548	9	22	28	22	28	You save an afflicted people, but Your eyes are on the haughty to bring them down.
8549	9	22	29	22	29	For You, O LORD, are my lamp; the LORD enlightens my darkness.
8550	9	22	30	22	30	For in You I can charge an army; with my God I can scale a wall.
8551	9	22	31	22	31	As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
8552	9	22	32	22	32	For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?
8553	9	22	33	22	33	God is my strong fortress and He makes my way clear.
8554	9	22	34	22	34	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and stations me upon the heights.
8555	9	22	35	22	35	He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
8556	9	22	36	22	36	You have given me Your shield of salvation, and Your gentleness exalts me.
8557	9	22	37	22	37	You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not give way.
8558	9	22	38	22	38	I pursued my enemies and destroyed them; I did not turn back until they were consumed.
8559	9	22	39	22	39	I devoured and crushed them so they could not rise; they have fallen under my feet.
8560	9	22	40	22	40	You have armed me with strength for battle; You have subdued my foes beneath me.
8561	9	22	41	22	41	You have made my enemies retreat before me; I put an end to those who hated me.
8562	9	22	42	22	42	They looked, but there was no one to save them—to the LORD, but He did not answer.
8563	9	22	43	22	43	I ground them as the dust of the earth; I crushed and trampled them like mud in the streets.
8564	9	22	44	22	44	You have delivered me from the strife of my people; You have preserved me as the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me.
8565	9	22	45	22	45	Foreigners cower before me; when they hear me, they obey me.
8566	9	22	46	22	46	Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds.
8567	9	22	47	22	47	The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! And may God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted—
8568	9	22	48	22	48	the God who avenges me and brings down nations beneath me,
8569	9	22	49	22	49	who frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent men.
8570	9	22	50	22	50	Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name.
8571	9	22	51	22	51	Great salvation He brings to His king. He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”
8572	9	23	1	23	1	These are the last words of David: “The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man raised on high, the one anointed by the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
8573	9	23	2	23	2	The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; His word was on my tongue.
8574	9	23	3	23	3	The God of Israel spoke; the Rock of Israel said to me, ‘He who rules the people with justice, who rules in the fear of God,
8575	9	23	4	23	4	is like the light of the morning at sunrise of a cloudless dawn, the glistening after the rain on the sprouting grass of the earth.’
8576	9	23	5	23	5	Is not my house right with God? For He has established with me an everlasting covenant, ordered and secured in every part. Will He not bring about my full salvation and my every desire?
8577	9	23	6	23	6	But the worthless are all like thorns raked aside, for they can never be gathered by hand.
8578	9	23	7	23	7	The man who touches them must be armed with iron or with the shaft of a spear. The fire burns them to ashes in the place where they lie.”
8579	9	23	8	23	8	These are the names of David’s mighty men: Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite was chief of the Three. He wielded his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed at one time.
8580	9	23	9	23	9	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he went with David to taunt the Philistines who had gathered for battle at Pas-dammim. The men of Israel retreated,
8581	9	23	10	23	10	but Eleazar stood his ground and struck the Philistines until his hand grew weary and stuck to his sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. Then the troops returned to him, but only to plunder the dead.
8582	9	23	11	23	11	And after him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines had banded together near a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them.
8583	9	23	12	23	12	But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory.
8584	9	23	13	23	13	At harvest time, three of the thirty chief men went down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
8585	9	23	14	23	14	At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
8586	9	23	15	23	15	David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
8587	9	23	16	23	16	So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD,
8588	9	23	17	23	17	saying, “Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this! Is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives?” So he refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
8589	9	23	18	23	18	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Three, and he lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three.
8590	9	23	19	23	19	Was he not more honored than the Three? And he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three.
8591	9	23	20	23	20	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.
8592	9	23	21	23	21	He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.
8593	9	23	22	23	22	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
8594	9	23	23	23	23	He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.
8595	9	23	24	23	24	Now these were members of the Thirty: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
8596	9	23	25	23	25	Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
8597	9	23	26	23	26	Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
8598	9	23	27	23	27	Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
8599	9	23	28	23	28	Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
8600	9	23	29	23	29	Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites,
8601	9	23	30	23	30	Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,
8602	9	23	31	23	31	Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
8603	9	23	32	23	32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
8604	9	23	33	23	33	son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
8605	9	23	34	23	34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
8606	9	23	35	23	35	Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
8607	9	23	36	23	36	Igal son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
8608	9	23	37	23	37	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
8609	9	23	38	23	38	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
8610	9	23	39	23	39	and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
8611	9	24	1	24	1	Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He stirred up David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.”
8612	9	24	2	24	2	So the king said to Joab the commander of his army, who was with him, “Go now throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and register the troops, so that I may know their number.”
8613	9	24	3	24	3	But Joab replied to the king, “May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”
8614	9	24	4	24	4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army departed from the presence of the king to count the troops of Israel.
8615	9	24	5	24	5	They crossed the Jordan and camped near Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the valley, and proceeded toward Gad and Jazer.
8616	9	24	6	24	6	Then they went to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and on to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon.
8617	9	24	7	24	7	They went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah, to Beersheba.
8618	9	24	8	24	8	At the end of nine months and twenty days, having gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem.
8619	9	24	9	24	9	And Joab reported to the king the total number of the troops. In Israel there were 800,000 men of valor who drew the sword, and in Judah there were 500,000.
8620	9	24	10	24	10	After David had numbered the troops, his conscience was stricken and he said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
8621	9	24	11	24	11	When David got up in the morning, a revelation from the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:
8622	9	24	12	24	12	“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’”
8623	9	24	13	24	13	So Gad went and said to David, “Shall you endure three years of famine in your land, or three months of fleeing the pursuit of your enemies, or three days of plague upon your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
8624	9	24	14	24	14	David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
8625	9	24	15	24	15	So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from that morning until the appointed time, and of the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died.
8626	9	24	16	24	16	But when the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
8627	9	24	17	24	17	When David saw the angel striking down the people, he said to the LORD, “Surely I, the shepherd, have sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house.”
8628	9	24	18	24	18	And that day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
8629	9	24	19	24	19	So David went up at the word of Gad, just as the LORD had commanded.
8630	9	24	20	24	20	When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, he went out and bowed facedown before the king.
8631	9	24	21	24	21	“Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” Araunah said. “To buy your threshing floor,” David replied, “that I may build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”
8632	9	24	22	24	22	Araunah said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good and offer it up. Here are the oxen for a burnt offering and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
8633	9	24	23	24	23	O king, Araunah gives all these to the king.” He also said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.”
8634	9	24	24	24	24	“No,” replied the king, “I insist on paying a price, for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
8635	9	24	25	24	25	And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then the LORD answered the prayers on behalf of the land, and the plague upon Israel was halted.
8636	10	1	1	1	1	Now King David was old and well along in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm.
8637	10	1	2	1	2	So his servants said to him, “Let us search for a young virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him and care for him and lie by his side to keep him warm.”
8638	10	1	3	1	3	Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
8639	10	1	4	1	4	The girl was unsurpassed in beauty; she cared for the king and served him, but he had no relations with her.
8640	10	1	5	1	5	At that time Adonijah, David’s son by Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying, “I will be king!” And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him.
8641	10	1	6	1	6	(His father had never once reprimanded him by saying, “Why do you act this way?” Adonijah was also very handsome, born next after Absalom.)
8642	10	1	7	1	7	So Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, who supported him.
8643	10	1	8	1	8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s mighty men would not join Adonijah.
8644	10	1	9	1	9	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king.
8645	10	1	10	1	10	But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.
8646	10	1	11	1	11	Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know it?
8647	10	1	12	1	12	Now please, come and let me advise you. Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
8648	10	1	13	1	13	Go at once to King David and say, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant, “Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?’
8649	10	1	14	1	14	Then, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”
8650	10	1	15	1	15	So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
8651	10	1	16	1	16	And Bathsheba bowed down in homage to the king, who asked, “What is your desire?”
8652	10	1	17	1	17	“My lord,” she replied, “you yourself swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God: ‘Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.’
8653	10	1	18	1	18	But now, behold, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, did not know it.
8654	10	1	19	1	19	And he has sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the other sons of the king, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon.
8655	10	1	20	1	20	And as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
8656	10	1	21	1	21	Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be counted as criminals.”
8657	10	1	22	1	22	And just then, while Bathsheba was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
8658	10	1	23	1	23	So the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And Nathan went in and bowed facedown before the king.
8659	10	1	24	1	24	“My lord the king,” said Nathan, “did you say, ‘Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne’?
8660	10	1	25	1	25	For today he has gone down and sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’
8661	10	1	26	1	26	But me your servant he did not invite, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.
8662	10	1	27	1	27	Has my lord the king let this happen without informing your servant who should sit on the throne after my lord the king?”
8663	10	1	28	1	28	Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba for me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him.
8664	10	1	29	1	29	And the king swore an oath, saying, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,
8665	10	1	30	1	30	I will carry out this very day exactly what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.”
8666	10	1	31	1	31	Bathsheba bowed facedown in homage to the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”
8667	10	1	32	1	32	Then King David said, “Call in for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king.
8668	10	1	33	1	33	“Take my servants with you,” said the king. “Set my son Solomon on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.
8669	10	1	34	1	34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. You are to blow the ram’s horn and declare, ‘Long live King Solomon!’
8670	10	1	35	1	35	Then you shall go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. For I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”
8671	10	1	36	1	36	“Amen,” replied Benaiah son of Jehoiada. “May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.
8672	10	1	37	1	37	Just as the LORD was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon and make his throne even greater than that of my lord King David.”
8673	10	1	38	1	38	Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, went down and set Solomon on King David’s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon.
8674	10	1	39	1	39	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram’s horn, and all the people proclaimed, “Long live King Solomon!”
8675	10	1	40	1	40	All the people followed him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth was split by the sound.
8676	10	1	41	1	41	Now Adonijah and all his guests were finishing their feast when they heard the sound of the ram’s horn. “Why is the city in such a loud uproar?” asked Joab.
8677	10	1	42	1	42	As he was speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” said Adonijah, “for you are a man of valor. You must be bringing good news.”
8678	10	1	43	1	43	“Not at all,” Jonathan replied. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
8679	10	1	44	1	44	And with Solomon, the king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with Cherethites and Pelethites, and they have set him on the king’s mule.
8680	10	1	45	1	45	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there with rejoicing that rings out in the city. That is the noise you hear.
8681	10	1	46	1	46	Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
8682	10	1	47	1	47	The king’s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your own name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ And the king has bowed in worship on his bed,
8683	10	1	48	1	48	saying, ‘May the LORD God of Israel be praised! Today He has provided one to sit on my throne, and my eyes have seen it.’”
8684	10	1	49	1	49	At this, all the guests of Adonijah arose in terror and scattered.
8685	10	1	50	1	50	But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar.
8686	10	1	51	1	51	It was reported to Solomon: “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.’”
8687	10	1	52	1	52	And Solomon replied, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he will die.”
8688	10	1	53	1	53	So King Solomon summoned Adonijah down from the altar, and he came and bowed down before King Solomon, who said to him, “Go to your home.”
8689	10	2	1	2	1	As the time drew near for David to die, he charged his son Solomon,
8690	10	2	2	2	2	“I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong and prove yourself a man.
8691	10	2	3	2	3	And keep the charge of the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees, as is written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn,
8692	10	2	4	2	4	and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise to me: ‘If your descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’
8693	10	2	5	2	5	Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.
8694	10	2	6	2	6	So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
8695	10	2	7	2	7	But show loving devotion to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
8696	10	2	8	2	8	Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you. He called down bitter curses against me on the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: ‘I will never kill you with the sword.’
8697	10	2	9	2	9	Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You know what you ought to do to him to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood.”
8698	10	2	10	2	10	Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
8699	10	2	11	2	11	The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
8700	10	2	12	2	12	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.
8701	10	2	13	2	13	Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she asked, “Do you come in peace?” “Yes, in peace,” he replied.
8702	10	2	14	2	14	Then he said, “I have something to tell you.” “Say it,” she answered.
8703	10	2	15	2	15	“You know that the kingship was mine,” he said. “All Israel expected that I should reign, but the kingship has turned to my brother, for it has come to him from the LORD.
8704	10	2	16	2	16	So now I have just one request of you; do not deny me.” “State your request,” she told him.
8705	10	2	17	2	17	Adonijah replied, “Please speak to King Solomon, since he will not turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
8706	10	2	18	2	18	“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”
8707	10	2	19	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then the king had a throne brought for his mother, who sat down at his right hand.
8708	10	2	20	2	20	“I have just one small request of you,” she said. “Do not deny me.” “Make your request, my mother,” the king replied, “for I will not deny you.”
8709	10	2	21	2	21	So Bathsheba said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”
8710	10	2	22	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my older brother, you might as well request the kingdom for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah.”
8711	10	2	23	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life.
8712	10	2	24	2	24	And now, as surely as the LORD lives—the One who established me, who set me on the throne of my father David, and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised—surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!”
8713	10	2	25	2	25	So King Solomon sent the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died.
8714	10	2	26	2	26	Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death at this time, since you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and you suffered through all that my father suffered.”
8715	10	2	27	2	27	So Solomon banished Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli.
8716	10	2	28	2	28	When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah but not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
8717	10	2	29	2	29	It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD and is now beside the altar.” So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down!”
8718	10	2	30	2	30	And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’” But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.” So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, “This is how Joab answered me.”
8719	10	2	31	2	31	And the king replied, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so remove from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood that Joab shed.
8720	10	2	32	2	32	The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous and better than he when he killed with the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army.
8721	10	2	33	2	33	Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab and his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.”
8722	10	2	34	2	34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his own home in the wilderness.
8723	10	2	35	2	35	And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar’s place.
8724	10	2	36	2	36	Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.
8725	10	2	37	2	37	On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”
8726	10	2	38	2	38	“The sentence is fair,” Shimei replied. “Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
8727	10	2	39	2	39	After three years, however, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And Shimei was told, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.”
8728	10	2	40	2	40	So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves, and he brought them back from Gath.
8729	10	2	41	2	41	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,
8730	10	2	42	2	42	the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, ‘On the day you leave and go elsewhere, know for sure that you will die’? And you told me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will comply.’
8731	10	2	43	2	43	So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command that I gave you?”
8732	10	2	44	2	44	The king also said, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head.
8733	10	2	45	2	45	But King Solomon will be blessed and David’s throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.”
8734	10	2	46	2	46	Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon.
8735	10	3	1	3	1	Later, Solomon formed an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. Solomon brought her to the City of David until he had finished building his palace and the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem.
8736	10	3	2	3	2	The people, however, were still sacrificing on the high places because a house for the Name of the LORD had not yet been built.
8737	10	3	3	3	3	And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of his father David—except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
8738	10	3	4	3	4	Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for it was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there.
8739	10	3	5	3	5	One night at Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!”
8740	10	3	6	3	6	Solomon replied, “You have shown much loving devotion to Your servant, my father David, because he walked before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart. And You have maintained this loving devotion by giving him a son to sit on his throne this very day.
8741	10	3	7	3	7	And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king in my father David’s place. But I am only a little child, not knowing how to go out or come in.
8742	10	3	8	3	8	Your servant is here among the people You have chosen, a people too numerous to count or number.
8743	10	3	9	3	9	Therefore give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
8744	10	3	10	3	10	Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had made this request.
8745	10	3	11	3	11	So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself or death for your enemies—but you have asked for discernment to administer justice—
8746	10	3	12	3	12	behold, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.
8747	10	3	13	3	13	Moreover, I will give you what you did not request—both riches and honor—so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal.
8748	10	3	14	3	14	So if you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commandments, just as your father David did, I will prolong your days.”
8749	10	3	15	3	15	Then Solomon awoke, and indeed it had been a dream. So he returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants.
8750	10	3	16	3	16	At that time two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
8751	10	3	17	3	17	One woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in the house.
8752	10	3	18	3	18	On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also had a baby. We were alone, with no one in the house but the two of us.
8753	10	3	19	3	19	During the night this woman’s son died because she rolled over on him.
8754	10	3	20	3	20	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep. She laid him in her bosom and put her dead son at my bosom.
8755	10	3	21	3	21	The next morning, when I got up to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. But when I examined him, I realized that he was not the son I had borne.”
8756	10	3	22	3	22	“No,” said the other woman, “the living one is my son and the dead one is your son.” But the first woman insisted, “No, the dead one is yours and the living one is mine.” So they argued before the king.
8757	10	3	23	3	23	Then the king replied, “This woman says, ‘My son is alive and yours is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead and mine is alive.’”
8758	10	3	24	3	24	The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought him a sword,
8759	10	3	25	3	25	and the king declared, “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”
8760	10	3	26	3	26	Then the woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she yearned with compassion for her son. “Please, my lord,” she said, “give her the living baby. Do not kill him!” But the other woman said, “He will not be mine or yours. Cut him in two!”
8761	10	3	27	3	27	Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. By no means should you kill him; she is his mother.”
8762	10	3	28	3	28	When all Israel heard of the judgment the king had given, they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
8763	10	4	1	4	1	So King Solomon ruled over Israel,
8764	10	4	2	4	2	and these were his chief officials: Azariah son of Zadok was the priest;
8765	10	4	3	4	3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
8766	10	4	4	4	4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
8767	10	4	5	4	5	Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the governors; Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king;
8768	10	4	6	4	6	Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor.
8769	10	4	7	4	7	Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel to provide food for the king and his household. Each one would arrange provisions for one month of the year,
8770	10	4	8	4	8	and these were their names: Ben-hur in the hill country of Ephraim;
8771	10	4	9	4	9	Ben-deker in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
8772	10	4	10	4	10	Ben-hesed in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);
8773	10	4	11	4	11	Ben-abinadab in Naphath-dor (Taphath, a daughter of Solomon, was his wife);
8774	10	4	12	4	12	Baana son of Ahilud in Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah and on past Jokmeam;
8775	10	4	13	4	13	Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead (the villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead belonged to him, as well as the region of Argob in Bashan with its sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
8776	10	4	14	4	14	Ahinadab son of Iddo in Mahanaim;
8777	10	4	15	4	15	Ahimaaz in Naphtali (he had married Basemath, a daughter of Solomon);
8778	10	4	16	4	16	Baana son of Hushai in Asher and in Aloth;
8779	10	4	17	4	17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah in Issachar;
8780	10	4	18	4	18	Shimei son of Ela in Benjamin;
8781	10	4	19	4	19	Geber son of Uri in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. He was the only governor in the land of Judah.
8782	10	4	20	4	20	The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore, and they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
8783	10	5	1	4	21	And Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
8784	10	5	2	4	22	Solomon’s provisions for a single day were thirty cors of fine flour, sixty cors of meal,
8785	10	5	3	4	23	ten fat oxen, twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened poultry.
8786	10	5	4	4	24	For Solomon had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates—over all the kingdoms from Tiphsah to Gaza—and he had peace on all sides.
8787	10	5	5	4	25	Throughout the days of Solomon, Judah and Israel lived in safety from Dan to Beersheba, each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.
8788	10	5	6	4	26	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses.
8789	10	5	7	4	27	Each month the governors in turn provided food for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
8790	10	5	8	4	28	Each one also brought to the required place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other horses.
8791	10	5	9	4	29	And God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand on the seashore.
8792	10	5	10	4	30	Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the men of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
8793	10	5	11	4	31	He was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations.
8794	10	5	12	4	32	Solomon composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
8795	10	5	13	4	33	He spoke of trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing in the wall, and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
8796	10	5	14	4	34	So men of all nations came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
8797	10	5	15	5	1	Now when Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king in his father’s place, he sent envoys to Solomon; for Hiram had always been a friend of David.
8798	10	5	16	5	2	And Solomon relayed this message to Hiram:
8799	10	5	17	5	3	“As you are aware, because of the wars waged on all sides against my father David, he could not build a house for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet.
8800	10	5	18	5	4	But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or crisis.
8801	10	5	19	5	5	So behold, I plan to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, according to what the LORD said to my father David: ‘I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the house for My Name.’
8802	10	5	20	5	6	Now therefore, order that cedars of Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you set, for you know that there are none among us as skilled in logging as the Sidonians.”
8803	10	5	21	5	7	When Hiram received Solomon’s message, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day! He has given David a wise son over this great people!”
8804	10	5	22	5	8	Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon, saying: “I have received your message; I will do all you desire regarding the cedar and cypress timber.
8805	10	5	23	5	9	My servants will haul the logs from Lebanon to the Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate the logs, and you can take them away. And in exchange, you can meet my needs by providing my household with food.”
8806	10	5	24	5	10	So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted,
8807	10	5	25	5	11	and year after year Solomon would provide Hiram with 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, as well as 20,000 baths of pure olive oil.
8808	10	5	26	5	12	And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
8809	10	5	27	5	13	Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel.
8810	10	5	28	5	14	He sent them to Lebanon in monthly shifts of 10,000 men, so that they would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home. And Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
8811	10	5	29	5	15	Solomon had 70,000 porters and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains,
8812	10	5	30	5	16	not including his 3,300 foremen who supervised the workers.
8813	10	5	31	5	17	And the king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones.
8814	10	5	32	5	18	So Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders, along with the Gebalites, quarried the stone and prepared the timber and stone for the construction of the temple.
8815	10	6	1	6	1	In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the month of Ziv, the second month of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, he began to build the house of the LORD.
8816	10	6	2	6	2	The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
8817	10	6	3	6	3	The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple and projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple.
8818	10	6	4	6	4	He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple.
8819	10	6	5	6	5	Against the walls of the temple and the inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple, in which he constructed the side rooms.
8820	10	6	6	6	6	The bottom floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits, and the third floor seven cubits. He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls.
8821	10	6	7	6	7	The temple was constructed using finished stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.
8822	10	6	8	6	8	The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third floor.
8823	10	6	9	6	9	So Solomon built the temple and finished it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar.
8824	10	6	10	6	10	He built chambers all along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple with beams of cedar.
8825	10	6	11	6	11	Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:
8826	10	6	12	6	12	“As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David.
8827	10	6	13	6	13	And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon My people Israel.”
8828	10	6	14	6	14	So Solomon built the temple and finished it.
8829	10	6	15	6	15	He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress boards.
8830	10	6	16	6	16	He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
8831	10	6	17	6	17	And the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.
8832	10	6	18	6	18	The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen.
8833	10	6	19	6	19	Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
8834	10	6	20	6	20	The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
8835	10	6	21	6	21	So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
8836	10	6	22	6	22	So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
8837	10	6	23	6	23	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood.
8838	10	6	24	6	24	One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits.
8839	10	6	25	6	25	The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape,
8840	10	6	26	6	26	and the height of each cherub was ten cubits.
8841	10	6	27	6	27	And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched.
8842	10	6	28	6	28	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
8843	10	6	29	6	29	Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
8844	10	6	30	6	30	And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.
8845	10	6	31	6	31	For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.
8846	10	6	32	6	32	The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.
8847	10	6	33	6	33	In the same way he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance.
8848	10	6	34	6	34	The two doors were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels.
8849	10	6	35	6	35	He carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold, hammered evenly over the carvings.
8850	10	6	36	6	36	Solomon built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams.
8851	10	6	37	6	37	The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of Ziv.
8852	10	6	38	6	38	In his eleventh year and eighth month, the month of Bul, the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification. So he built the temple in seven years.
8853	10	7	1	7	1	Solomon, however, took thirteen years to complete the construction of his entire palace.
8854	10	7	2	7	2	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar pillars supporting the cedar beams.
8855	10	7	3	7	3	The house was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the pillars—forty-five beams, fifteen per row.
8856	10	7	4	7	4	There were three rows of high windows facing each other in three tiers.
8857	10	7	5	7	5	All the doorways had rectangular frames, with the openings facing each other in tiers of three.
8858	10	7	6	7	6	Solomon made his colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, with a portico in front of it and a canopy with pillars in front of the portico.
8859	10	7	7	7	7	In addition, he built a hall for the throne, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.
8860	10	7	8	7	8	And the palace where Solomon would live, set further back, was of similar construction. He also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married.
8861	10	7	9	7	9	All these buildings were constructed with costly stones, cut to size and trimmed with saws inside and out from the foundation to the eaves, and from the outside to the great courtyard.
8862	10	7	10	7	10	The foundations were laid with large, costly stones, some ten cubits long and some eight cubits long.
8863	10	7	11	7	11	Above these were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.
8864	10	7	12	7	12	The great courtyard was surrounded by three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams, as were the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD.
8865	10	7	13	7	13	Now King Solomon sent to bring Huram from Tyre.
8866	10	7	14	7	14	He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work.
8867	10	7	15	7	15	He cast two pillars of bronze, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.
8868	10	7	16	7	16	He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars, each capital five cubits high.
8869	10	7	17	7	17	For the capitals on top of the pillars he made a network of lattice, with wreaths of chainwork, seven for each capital.
8870	10	7	18	7	18	Likewise, he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates around each grating to cover each capital atop the pillars.
8871	10	7	19	7	19	And the capitals atop the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, four cubits high.
8872	10	7	20	7	20	On the capitals of both pillars, just above the rounded projection next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital.
8873	10	7	21	7	21	Thus he set up the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jachin, and the pillar to the north he named Boaz.
8874	10	7	22	7	22	And the tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the work of the pillars was completed.
8875	10	7	23	7	23	He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference.
8876	10	7	24	7	24	Below the rim, ornamental buds encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea.
8877	10	7	25	7	25	The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested on them, with all their hindquarters toward the center.
8878	10	7	26	7	26	It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold two thousand baths.
8879	10	7	27	7	27	In addition, he made ten movable stands of bronze, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
8880	10	7	28	7	28	This was the design of the stands: They had side panels attached to uprights,
8881	10	7	29	7	29	and on the panels between the uprights were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the uprights was a pedestal above, and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beveled work.
8882	10	7	30	7	30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and a basin resting on four supports, with wreaths at each side.
8883	10	7	31	7	31	The opening to each stand inside the crown at the top was one cubit deep, with a round opening like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half wide. And around its opening were engravings, but the panels of the stands were square, not round.
8884	10	7	32	7	32	There were four wheels under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand; each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter.
8885	10	7	33	7	33	The wheels were made like chariot wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal.
8886	10	7	34	7	34	Each stand had four handles, one for each corner, projecting from the stand.
8887	10	7	35	7	35	At the top of each stand was a circular band half a cubit high. The supports and panels were cast as a unit with the top of the stand.
8888	10	7	36	7	36	He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever each had space, with wreaths all around.
8889	10	7	37	7	37	In this way he made the ten stands, each with the same casting, dimensions, and shape.
8890	10	7	38	7	38	He also made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin for each of the ten stands.
8891	10	7	39	7	39	He set five stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north, and he put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.
8892	10	7	40	7	40	Additionally, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of the LORD:
8893	10	7	41	7	41	the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars;
8894	10	7	42	7	42	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network covering both the bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars);
8895	10	7	43	7	43	the ten stands; the ten basins on the stands;
8896	10	7	44	7	44	the Sea; the twelve oxen underneath the Sea;
8897	10	7	45	7	45	and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. All the articles that Huram made for King Solomon in the house of the LORD were made of burnished bronze.
8898	10	7	46	7	46	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
8899	10	7	47	7	47	Solomon left all these articles unweighed, because there were so many. The weight of the bronze could not be determined.
8900	10	7	48	7	48	Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of the LORD: the golden altar; the golden table on which was placed the Bread of the Presence;
8901	10	7	49	7	49	the lampstands of pure gold in front of the inner sanctuary, five on the right side and five on the left; the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs;
8902	10	7	50	7	50	the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers; and the gold hinges for the doors of the inner temple (that is, the Most Holy Place) as well as for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
8903	10	7	51	7	51	So all the work that King Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD was completed. Then Solomon brought the consecrated items of his father David—the silver, the gold, and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
8904	10	8	1	8	1	At that time Solomon assembled before him in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David.
8905	10	8	2	8	2	And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month, the month of Ethanim.
8906	10	8	3	8	3	When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,
8907	10	8	4	8	4	and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. So the priests and Levites carried them up.
8908	10	8	5	8	5	There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
8909	10	8	6	8	6	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
8910	10	8	7	8	7	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles.
8911	10	8	8	8	8	The poles extended far enough that their ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day.
8912	10	8	9	8	9	There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of the land of Egypt.
8913	10	8	10	8	10	And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD
8914	10	8	11	8	11	so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
8915	10	8	12	8	12	Then Solomon said: “The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick cloud.
8916	10	8	13	8	13	I have indeed built You an exalted house, a place for You to dwell forever.”
8917	10	8	14	8	14	And as the whole assembly of Israel stood there, the king turned around and blessed them all
8918	10	8	15	8	15	and said: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying,
8919	10	8	16	8	16	‘Since the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house so that My Name would be there. But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’
8920	10	8	17	8	17	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
8921	10	8	18	8	18	But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart.
8922	10	8	19	8	19	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own offspring, will build the house for My Name.’
8923	10	8	20	8	20	Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
8924	10	8	21	8	21	And there I have provided a place for the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”
8925	10	8	22	8	22	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven,
8926	10	8	23	8	23	and said: “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.
8927	10	8	24	8	24	You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.
8928	10	8	25	8	25	Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done.’
8929	10	8	26	8	26	And now, O God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant, my father David.
8930	10	8	27	8	27	But will God indeed dwell upon the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built.
8931	10	8	28	8	28	Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You today.
8932	10	8	29	8	29	May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.
8933	10	8	30	8	30	Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive.
8934	10	8	31	8	31	When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
8935	10	8	32	8	32	then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
8936	10	8	33	8	33	When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading with You in this temple,
8937	10	8	34	8	34	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to their fathers.
8938	10	8	35	8	35	When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them,
8939	10	8	36	8	36	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
8940	10	8	37	8	37	When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemy besieges them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come,
8941	10	8	38	8	38	may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make—each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple—
8942	10	8	39	8	39	be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and act, and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of all men—
8943	10	8	40	8	40	so that they may fear You all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers.
8944	10	8	41	8	41	And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name—
8945	10	8	42	8	42	for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
8946	10	8	43	8	43	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name.
8947	10	8	44	8	44	When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name,
8948	10	8	45	8	45	then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause.
8949	10	8	46	8	46	When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near,
8950	10	8	47	8	47	and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’
8951	10	8	48	8	48	and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray to You in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name,
8952	10	8	49	8	49	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause.
8953	10	8	50	8	50	May You forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all the transgressions they have committed against You, and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors to show them mercy.
8954	10	8	51	8	51	For they are Your people and Your inheritance; You brought them out of Egypt, out of the furnace for iron.
8955	10	8	52	8	52	May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel, and may You listen to them whenever they call to You.
8956	10	8	53	8	53	For You, O Lord GOD, as Your inheritance, have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth, as You spoke through Your servant Moses when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.”
8957	10	8	54	8	54	Now when Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
8958	10	8	55	8	55	And he stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:
8959	10	8	56	8	56	“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses.
8960	10	8	57	8	57	May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He never leave us nor forsake us.
8961	10	8	58	8	58	May He incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances He commanded our fathers.
8962	10	8	59	8	59	And may these words with which I have made my petition before the LORD be near to the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold the cause of His servant and of His people Israel as each day requires,
8963	10	8	60	8	60	so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God. There is no other!
8964	10	8	61	8	61	So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God, as it is this day, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments.”
8965	10	8	62	8	62	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
8966	10	8	63	8	63	And Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD.
8967	10	8	64	8	64	On that same day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to contain all these offerings.
8968	10	8	65	8	65	So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast before the LORD our God for seven days and seven more days—fourteen days in all.
8969	10	8	66	8	66	On the fifteenth day Solomon sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel.
8970	10	9	1	9	1	Now when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all that he had desired to do,
8971	10	9	2	9	2	the LORD appeared to him a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
8972	10	9	3	9	3	And the LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and petition before Me. I have consecrated this temple you have built by putting My Name there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there for all time.
8973	10	9	4	9	4	And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
8974	10	9	5	9	5	then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’
8975	10	9	6	9	6	But if indeed you or your sons turn away from following Me and do not keep the commandments and statutes I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods,
8976	10	9	7	9	7	then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and this temple that I have sanctified for My Name I will banish from My presence. Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples.
8977	10	9	8	9	8	And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and will hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
8978	10	9	9	9	9	And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.’”
8979	10	9	10	9	10	Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace,
8980	10	9	11	9	11	King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress logs and gold for his every desire.
8981	10	9	12	9	12	So Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them.
8982	10	9	13	9	13	“What are these towns you have given me, my brother?” asked Hiram, and he called them the Land of Cabul, as they are called to this day.
8983	10	9	14	9	14	And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold.
8984	10	9	15	9	15	This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon imposed to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces, and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
8985	10	9	16	9	16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
8986	10	9	17	9	17	So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon,
8987	10	9	18	9	18	Baalath, and Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah,
8988	10	9	19	9	19	as well as all the store cities that Solomon had for his chariots and horses—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
8989	10	9	20	9	20	As for all the people who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—
8990	10	9	21	9	21	their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction—Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
8991	10	9	22	9	22	But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery, because they were his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
8992	10	9	23	9	23	They were also the chief officers over Solomon’s projects: 550 supervisors over the people who did the work.
8993	10	9	24	9	24	As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her, he built the supporting terraces.
8994	10	9	25	9	25	Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the temple.
8995	10	9	26	9	26	King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
8996	10	9	27	9	27	And Hiram sent his servants, men who knew the sea, to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s servants.
8997	10	9	28	9	28	They sailed to Ophir and imported gold from there—420 talents—and delivered it to Solomon.
8998	10	10	1	10	1	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions.
8999	10	10	2	10	2	She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones. So she came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was on her mind.
9000	10	10	3	10	3	And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain.
9001	10	10	4	10	4	When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,
9002	10	10	5	10	5	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.
9003	10	10	6	10	6	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true.
9004	10	10	7	10	7	But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report I heard.
9005	10	10	8	10	8	How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
9006	10	10	9	10	9	Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness.”
9007	10	10	10	10	10	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was such an abundance of spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
9008	10	10	11	10	11	(The fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug wood and precious stones.
9009	10	10	12	10	12	The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought in, nor has such been seen to this day.)
9010	10	10	13	10	13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.
9011	10	10	14	10	14	The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents,
9012	10	10	15	10	15	not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
9013	10	10	16	10	16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
9014	10	10	17	10	17	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
9015	10	10	18	10	18	Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
9016	10	10	19	10	19	The throne had six steps and a rounded top at the back of the throne. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.
9017	10	10	20	10	20	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
9018	10	10	21	10	21	All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
9019	10	10	22	10	22	For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
9020	10	10	23	10	23	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
9021	10	10	24	10	24	The whole world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
9022	10	10	25	10	25	Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
9023	10	10	26	10	26	Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
9024	10	10	27	10	27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.
9025	10	10	28	10	28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
9026	10	10	29	10	29	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.
9027	10	11	1	11	1	King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh—women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women.
9028	10	11	2	11	2	These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love.
9029	10	11	3	11	3	He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—and his wives turned his heart away.
9030	10	11	4	11	4	For when Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been.
9031	10	11	5	11	5	Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
9032	10	11	6	11	6	So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely.
9033	10	11	7	11	7	At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.
9034	10	11	8	11	8	He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
9035	10	11	9	11	9	Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
9036	10	11	10	11	10	Although He had warned Solomon explicitly not to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s command.
9037	10	11	11	11	11	Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.
9038	10	11	12	11	12	Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
9039	10	11	13	11	13	Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”
9040	10	11	14	11	14	Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
9041	10	11	15	11	15	Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom.
9042	10	11	16	11	16	Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom.
9043	10	11	17	11	17	But Hadad, still just a young boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of his father.
9044	10	11	18	11	18	Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
9045	10	11	19	11	19	There Hadad found such great favor in the sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife.
9046	10	11	20	11	20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace, and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh.
9047	10	11	21	11	21	When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”
9048	10	11	22	11	22	But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?” “Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but please let me go.”
9049	10	11	23	11	23	And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah,
9050	10	11	24	11	24	and had gathered men to himself. When David killed the Zobaites, Rezon captained a band of raiders and went to Damascus, where they settled and gained control.
9051	10	11	25	11	25	Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the days of Solomon, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel.
9052	10	11	26	11	26	Now Solomon’s servant, Jeroboam son of Nebat, was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon,
9053	10	11	27	11	27	and this is the account of his rebellion against the king. Solomon had built the supporting terraces and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
9054	10	11	28	11	28	Now Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
9055	10	11	29	11	29	During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field.
9056	10	11	30	11	30	And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces,
9057	10	11	31	11	31	and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes.
9058	10	11	32	11	32	But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
9059	10	11	33	11	33	For they have forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and judgments, as Solomon’s father David did.
9060	10	11	34	11	34	Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes.
9061	10	11	35	11	35	But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you.
9062	10	11	36	11	36	I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put My Name.
9063	10	11	37	11	37	But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.
9064	10	11	38	11	38	If you listen to all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
9065	10	11	39	11	39	Because of this, I will humble David’s descendants—but not forever.’”
9066	10	11	40	11	40	Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he remained until the death of Solomon.
9067	10	11	41	11	41	As for the rest of the acts of Solomon—all that he did, as well as his wisdom—are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
9068	10	11	42	11	42	Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
9069	10	11	43	11	43	And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
9070	10	12	1	12	1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king.
9071	10	12	2	12	2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he was still in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon and had been living ever since.
9072	10	12	3	12	3	So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
9073	10	12	4	12	4	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
9074	10	12	5	12	5	Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days and then return to me.” So the people departed.
9075	10	12	6	12	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked.
9076	10	12	7	12	7	They replied, “If you will be a servant to these people and serve them this day, and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
9077	10	12	8	12	8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him.
9078	10	12	9	12	9	He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
9079	10	12	10	12	10	The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!
9080	10	12	11	12	11	Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’”
9081	10	12	12	12	12	After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.”
9082	10	12	13	12	13	And the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the elders
9083	10	12	14	12	14	and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.”
9084	10	12	15	12	15	So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word He had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
9085	10	12	16	12	16	When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What portion do we have in David, and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David!” So the Israelites went home,
9086	10	12	17	12	17	but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.
9087	10	12	18	12	18	Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem.
9088	10	12	19	12	19	So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.
9089	10	12	20	12	20	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David.
9090	10	12	21	12	21	And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000 choice warriors—to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
9091	10	12	22	12	22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
9092	10	12	23	12	23	“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people
9093	10	12	24	12	24	that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for this word is from Me.’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and turned back according to the word of the LORD.
9094	10	12	25	12	25	Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And from there he went out and built Penuel.
9095	10	12	26	12	26	Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David.
9096	10	12	27	12	27	If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah; then they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
9097	10	12	28	12	28	After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves and said to the people, “Going to Jerusalem is too much for you. Here, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
9098	10	12	29	12	29	One calf he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.
9099	10	12	30	12	30	And this thing became a sin; the people walked as far as Dan to worship before one of the calves.
9100	10	12	31	12	31	Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places and appointed from every class of people priests who were not Levites.
9101	10	12	32	12	32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up, and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up.
9102	10	12	33	12	33	On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar he had set up in Bethel. So he ordained a feast for the Israelites, offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense.
9103	10	13	1	13	1	Suddenly, as Jeroboam was standing beside the altar to burn incense, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD.
9104	10	13	2	13	2	And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, “O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and human bones will be burned upon you.’”
9105	10	13	3	13	3	That day the man of God gave a sign, saying, “The LORD has spoken this sign: ‘Surely the altar will be split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out.’”
9106	10	13	4	13	4	Now when King Jeroboam, who was at the altar in Bethel, heard the word that the man of God had cried out against it, he stretched out his hand and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward him withered, so that he could not pull it back.
9107	10	13	5	13	5	And the altar was split apart, and the ashes poured out, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
9108	10	13	6	13	6	Then the king responded to the man of God, “Intercede with the LORD your God and pray that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him as it was before.
9109	10	13	7	13	7	Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”
9110	10	13	8	13	8	But the man of God replied, “If you were to give me half your possessions, I still would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.
9111	10	13	9	13	9	For this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.’”
9112	10	13	10	13	10	So the man of God went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
9113	10	13	11	13	11	Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words that the man had spoken to the king.
9114	10	13	12	13	12	“Which way did he go?” their father asked. And his sons had seen the way taken by the man of God, who had come from Judah.
9115	10	13	13	13	13	So the prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” Then they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it
9116	10	13	14	13	14	and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” “I am,” he replied.
9117	10	13	15	13	15	So the prophet said to the man of God, “Come home with me and eat some bread.”
9118	10	13	16	13	16	But the man replied, “I cannot return with you or eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
9119	10	13	17	13	17	For I have been told by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.’”
9120	10	13	18	13	18	Then the prophet replied, “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water.’” The old prophet was lying to him,
9121	10	13	19	13	19	but the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.
9122	10	13	20	13	20	While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back,
9123	10	13	21	13	21	and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you,
9124	10	13	22	13	22	but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the place where He told you not to do so, your body shall never reach the tomb of your fathers.’”
9125	10	13	23	13	23	And after the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet who had brought him back saddled the donkey for him.
9126	10	13	24	13	24	As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
9127	10	13	25	13	25	And there were men passing by who saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported this in the city where the old prophet lived.
9128	10	13	26	13	26	When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard this, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to him.”
9129	10	13	27	13	27	Then the old prophet instructed his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it,
9130	10	13	28	13	28	and he went and found the body lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the donkey.
9131	10	13	29	13	29	So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
9132	10	13	30	13	30	Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they lamented over him, “Oh, my brother!”
9133	10	13	31	13	31	After he had buried him, the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones,
9134	10	13	32	13	32	for the message that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria will surely come to pass.”
9135	10	13	33	13	33	Even after these events, Jeroboam did not repent of his evil ways, but again he appointed priests for the high places from every class of people. He ordained anyone who desired to be a priest of the high places.
9136	10	13	34	13	34	And this was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its extermination and destruction from the face of the earth.
9137	10	14	1	14	1	At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,
9138	10	14	2	14	2	and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not recognize you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people.
9139	10	14	3	14	3	Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the boy.”
9140	10	14	4	14	4	Jeroboam’s wife did as instructed; she arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
9141	10	14	5	14	5	But the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.”
9142	10	14	6	14	6	So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news.
9143	10	14	7	14	7	Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My people Israel.
9144	10	14	8	14	8	I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you were not like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes.
9145	10	14	9	14	9	You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me, and you have flung Me behind your back.
9146	10	14	10	14	10	Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam: I will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, both slave and free; I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns up dung until it is gone!
9147	10	14	11	14	11	Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.’ For the LORD has spoken.
9148	10	14	12	14	12	As for you, get up and go home. When your feet enter the city, the child will die.
9149	10	14	13	14	13	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him, for this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam.
9150	10	14	14	14	14	Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day—yes, even today!
9151	10	14	15	14	15	For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking the LORD to anger.
9152	10	14	16	14	16	So He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”
9153	10	14	17	14	17	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and departed for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.
9154	10	14	18	14	18	And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.
9155	10	14	19	14	19	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
9156	10	14	20	14	20	And the length of Jeroboam’s reign was twenty-two years, and he rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.
9157	10	14	21	14	21	Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
9158	10	14	22	14	22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and by the sins they committed they provoked Him to jealous anger more than all their fathers had done.
9159	10	14	23	14	23	They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
9160	10	14	24	14	24	There were even male cult prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
9161	10	14	25	14	25	In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem.
9162	10	14	26	14	26	He seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made.
9163	10	14	27	14	27	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
9164	10	14	28	14	28	And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would bear the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom.
9165	10	14	29	14	29	As for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, along with all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9166	10	14	30	14	30	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days.
9167	10	14	31	14	31	And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David; his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. And his son Abijam reigned in his place.
9168	10	15	1	15	1	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam became king of Judah,
9169	10	15	2	15	2	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
9170	10	15	3	15	3	And Abijam walked in all the sins that his father before him had committed, and his heart was not as fully devoted to the LORD his God as the heart of David his forefather had been.
9171	10	15	4	15	4	Nevertheless, for the sake of David, the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and to make Jerusalem strong.
9172	10	15	5	15	5	For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not turned aside from anything the LORD commanded all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
9173	10	15	6	15	6	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of Abijam’s life.
9174	10	15	7	15	7	As for the rest of the acts of Abijam, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
9175	10	15	8	15	8	And Abijam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David, and his son Asa reigned in his place.
9176	10	15	9	15	9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Asa became king of Judah,
9177	10	15	10	15	10	and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
9178	10	15	11	15	11	And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done.
9179	10	15	12	15	12	He banished the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all of the idols that his fathers had made.
9180	10	15	13	15	13	He also removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
9181	10	15	14	15	14	The high places were not removed, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted to the LORD all his days.
9182	10	15	15	15	15	And he brought into the house of the LORD the silver and gold and other articles that he and his father had dedicated.
9183	10	15	16	15	16	Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days.
9184	10	15	17	15	17	Baasha king of Israel went to war against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
9185	10	15	18	15	18	So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with this message to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus:
9186	10	15	19	15	19	“Let there be a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”
9187	10	15	20	15	20	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and the whole land of Naphtali, including the region of Chinnereth.
9188	10	15	21	15	21	When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
9189	10	15	22	15	22	Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah, with no exception, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah.
9190	10	15	23	15	23	Now the rest of the acts of Asa, along with all his might, all his accomplishments, and the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet.
9191	10	15	24	15	24	And Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of his father David, and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.
9192	10	15	25	15	25	In the second year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned two years.
9193	10	15	26	15	26	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.
9194	10	15	27	15	27	Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon of the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging the city.
9195	10	15	28	15	28	In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha killed Nadab and reigned in his place.
9196	10	15	29	15	29	As soon as Baasha became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
9197	10	15	30	15	30	because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.
9198	10	15	31	15	31	As for the rest of the acts of Nadab, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9199	10	15	32	15	32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days.
9200	10	15	33	15	33	In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years.
9201	10	15	34	15	34	And Baasha did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.
9202	10	16	1	16	1	Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying:
9203	10	16	2	16	2	“Even though I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin and to provoke Me to anger by their sins.
9204	10	16	3	16	3	So now I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat:
9205	10	16	4	16	4	Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.”
9206	10	16	5	16	5	As for the rest of the acts of Baasha, along with his accomplishments and might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9207	10	16	6	16	6	And Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah reigned in his place.
9208	10	16	7	16	7	Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands and becoming like the house of Jeroboam, and also because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam.
9209	10	16	8	16	8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
9210	10	16	9	16	9	However, while Elah was in Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza the steward of his household there, Elah’s servant Zimri, the commander of half his chariots, conspired against him.
9211	10	16	10	16	10	So in the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri went in, struck Elah down, and killed him. And Zimri reigned in his place.
9212	10	16	11	16	11	As soon as Zimri began to reign and was seated on the throne, he struck down the entire household of Baasha. He did not leave a single male, whether a kinsman or friend.
9213	10	16	12	16	12	So Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, according to the word that the LORD had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet.
9214	10	16	13	16	13	This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
9215	10	16	14	16	14	As for the rest of the acts of Elah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9216	10	16	15	16	15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines,
9217	10	16	16	16	16	and the people in the camp heard that Zimri had not only conspired but had also struck down the king. So there in the camp that very day, all Israel proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel.
9218	10	16	17	16	17	Then Omri and all the Israelites marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
9219	10	16	18	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned it down upon himself. So he died
9220	10	16	19	16	19	because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD and following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit.
9221	10	16	20	16	20	As for the rest of the acts of Zimri and the treason he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9222	10	16	21	16	21	At that time the people of Israel were divided: Half of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath as king, and half supported Omri.
9223	10	16	22	16	22	But the followers of Omri proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
9224	10	16	23	16	23	In the thirty-first year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
9225	10	16	24	16	24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city there, calling it Samaria after the name of Shemer, who had owned the hill.
9226	10	16	25	16	25	But Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.
9227	10	16	26	16	26	For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sins, which he caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
9228	10	16	27	16	27	As for the rest of the acts of Omri, along with his accomplishments and the might he exercised, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9229	10	16	28	16	28	And Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab reigned in his place.
9230	10	16	29	16	29	In the thirty-eighth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twenty-two years.
9231	10	16	30	16	30	However, Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him.
9232	10	16	31	16	31	And as if it were not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he even married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and he then proceeded to serve and worship Baal.
9233	10	16	32	16	32	First, Ahab set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he had built in Samaria.
9234	10	16	33	16	33	Then he set up an Asherah pole. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel before him.
9235	10	16	34	16	34	In Ahab’s days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his youngest he set up its gates, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through Joshua son of Nun.
9236	10	17	1	17	1	Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was among the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As surely as the LORD lives—the God of Israel before whom I stand—there will be neither dew nor rain in these years except at my word!”
9237	10	17	2	17	2	Then a revelation from the LORD came to Elijah:
9238	10	17	3	17	3	“Leave here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Brook Cherith, east of the Jordan.
9239	10	17	4	17	4	And you are to drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”
9240	10	17	5	17	5	So Elijah did what the LORD had told him, and he went and lived by the Brook Cherith, east of the Jordan.
9241	10	17	6	17	6	The ravens would bring him bread and meat in the morning and evening, and he would drink from the brook.
9242	10	17	7	17	7	Some time later, however, the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
9243	10	17	8	17	8	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah:
9244	10	17	9	17	9	“Get up and go to Zarephath of Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”
9245	10	17	10	17	10	So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow gathering sticks. Elijah called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.”
9246	10	17	11	17	11	And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”
9247	10	17	12	17	12	But she replied, “As surely as the LORD your God lives, I have no bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks to take home and prepare a meal for myself and my son, so that we may eat it and die.”
9248	10	17	13	17	13	“Do not be afraid,” Elijah said to her. “Go and do as you have said. But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have, and bring it out to me. Afterward, make some for yourself and your son,
9249	10	17	14	17	14	for this is what the LORD God of Israel says: ‘The jar of flour will not be exhausted and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the face of the earth.’”
9250	10	17	15	17	15	So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and there was food every day for Elijah and the woman and her household.
9251	10	17	16	17	16	The jar of flour was not exhausted and the jug of oil did not run dry, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through Elijah.
9252	10	17	17	17	17	Later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill, and his sickness grew worse and worse, until no breath remained in him.
9253	10	17	18	17	18	“O man of God,” said the woman to Elijah, “what have you done to me? Have you come to remind me of my iniquity and cause the death of my son?”
9254	10	17	19	17	19	But Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
9255	10	17	20	17	20	Then he cried out to the LORD, “O LORD my God, have You also brought tragedy on this widow who has opened her home to me, by causing her son to die?”
9256	10	17	21	17	21	Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the LORD, “O LORD my God, please let this boy’s life return to him!”
9257	10	17	22	17	22	And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah, and the child’s life returned to him, and he lived.
9258	10	17	23	17	23	Then Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. “Look, your son is alive,” Elijah declared.
9259	10	17	24	17	24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is truth.”
9260	10	18	1	18	1	After a long time, in the third year of the drought, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: “Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth.”
9261	10	18	2	18	2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria,
9262	10	18	3	18	3	and Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Now Obadiah greatly feared the LORD,
9263	10	18	4	18	4	for when Jezebel had slaughtered the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty men per cave, providing them with food and water.)
9264	10	18	5	18	5	Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go throughout the land to every spring and every valley. Perhaps we will find grass to keep the horses and mules alive so that we will not have to destroy any livestock.”
9265	10	18	6	18	6	So they divided the land to explore. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
9266	10	18	7	18	7	Now as Obadiah went on his way, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized him, he fell facedown and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
9267	10	18	8	18	8	“It is I,” he answered. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here!’”
9268	10	18	9	18	9	But Obadiah replied, “How have I sinned, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death?
9269	10	18	10	18	10	As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ he made that kingdom or nation swear that they had not found you.
9270	10	18	11	18	11	And now you say, ‘Go tell your master that Elijah is here!’
9271	10	18	12	18	12	I do not know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off when I leave you. Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth.
9272	10	18	13	18	13	Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD, fifty men per cave, and I provided them with food and water.
9273	10	18	14	18	14	And now you say, ‘Go tell your lord that Elijah is here!’ He will kill me!”
9274	10	18	15	18	15	Then Elijah said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will present myself to Ahab today.”
9275	10	18	16	18	16	So Obadiah went to inform Ahab, who went to meet Elijah.
9276	10	18	17	18	17	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him, “Is that you, O troubler of Israel?”
9277	10	18	18	18	18	“I have not troubled Israel,” Elijah replied, “but you and your father’s house have, for you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals.
9278	10	18	19	18	19	Now summon all Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel, along with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
9279	10	18	20	18	20	So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
9280	10	18	21	18	21	Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him. But if Baal is God, follow him.” But the people did not answer a word.
9281	10	18	22	18	22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I am the only remaining prophet of the LORD, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
9282	10	18	23	18	23	Get two bulls for us. Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood but not light the fire. And I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not light the fire.
9283	10	18	24	18	24	Then you may call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The God who answers by fire, He is God.” And all the people answered, “What you say is good.”
9284	10	18	25	18	25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.”
9285	10	18	26	18	26	And they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, shouting, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no sound, and no one answered as they leaped around the altar they had made.
9286	10	18	27	18	27	At noon Elijah began to taunt them, saying, “Shout louder, for he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or occupied, or on a journey. Perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened!”
9287	10	18	28	18	28	So they shouted louder and cut themselves with knives and lances, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them.
9288	10	18	29	18	29	Midday passed, and they kept on raving until the time of the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
9289	10	18	30	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people approached him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.
9290	10	18	31	18	31	And Elijah took twelve stones, one for each tribe of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come and said, “Israel shall be your name.”
9291	10	18	32	18	32	And with the stones, Elijah built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
9292	10	18	33	18	33	Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, placed it on the wood,
9293	10	18	34	18	34	and said, “Fill four waterpots and pour the water on the offering and on the wood.” “Do it a second time,” he said, and they did it a second time. “Do it a third time,” he said, and they did it a third time.
9294	10	18	35	18	35	So the water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
9295	10	18	36	18	36	At the time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached the altar and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and have done all these things at Your command.
9296	10	18	37	18	37	Answer me, O LORD! Answer me, so that this people will know that You, the LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back again.”
9297	10	18	38	18	38	Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench.
9298	10	18	39	18	39	When all the people saw this, they fell facedown and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”
9299	10	18	40	18	40	Then Elijah ordered them, “Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let a single one escape.” So they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered them there.
9300	10	18	41	18	41	And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.”
9301	10	18	42	18	42	So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel, bent down on the ground, and put his face between his knees.
9302	10	18	43	18	43	“Go and look toward the sea,” he said to his servant. So the servant went and looked, and he said, “There is nothing there.” Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”
9303	10	18	44	18	44	On the seventh time the servant reported, “There is a cloud as small as a man’s hand rising from the sea.” And Elijah replied, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’”
9304	10	18	45	18	45	Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and a heavy rain began to fall. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.
9305	10	18	46	18	46	And the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah, and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
9306	10	19	1	19	1	Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
9307	10	19	2	19	2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the lives of those you killed!”
9308	10	19	3	19	3	And Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
9309	10	19	4	19	4	while he himself traveled on a day’s journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, LORD,” he said. “Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”
9310	10	19	5	19	5	Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”
9311	10	19	6	19	6	And he looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again.
9312	10	19	7	19	7	A second time the angel of the LORD returned and touched him, saying, “Get up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you.”
9313	10	19	8	19	8	So he got up and ate and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
9314	10	19	9	19	9	There Elijah entered a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
9315	10	19	10	19	10	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.”
9316	10	19	11	19	11	Then the LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD. Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.” And a great and mighty wind tore into the mountains and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
9317	10	19	12	19	12	After the earthquake there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a still, small voice.
9318	10	19	13	19	13	When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
9319	10	19	14	19	14	“I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.”
9320	10	19	15	19	15	Then the LORD said to him, “Go back by the way you came, to the Desert of Damascus. When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
9321	10	19	16	19	16	You are also to anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet.
9322	10	19	17	19	17	Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Jehu.
9323	10	19	18	19	18	Nevertheless, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.”
9324	10	19	19	19	19	So Elijah departed and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him.
9325	10	19	20	19	20	So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” Elijah replied, “for what have I done to you?”
9326	10	19	21	19	21	So Elisha turned back from him, took his pair of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s equipment, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow and serve Elijah.
9327	10	20	1	20	1	Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he marched up, besieged Samaria, and waged war against it.
9328	10	20	2	20	2	Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel,
9329	10	20	3	20	3	saying, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and your best wives and children are mine!’”
9330	10	20	4	20	4	And the king of Israel replied, “Just as you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.”
9331	10	20	5	20	5	The messengers came back and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent to you to demand your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.
9332	10	20	6	20	6	But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to search your palace and the houses of your servants. They will seize and carry away all that is precious to you.’”
9333	10	20	7	20	7	Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please take note and see that this man is looking for trouble, for when he demanded my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, I did not deny him.”
9334	10	20	8	20	8	And the elders and the people all said, “Do not listen to him or consent to his terms.”
9335	10	20	9	20	9	So Ahab answered the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded of your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad.
9336	10	20	10	20	10	Then Ben-hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if enough dust remains of Samaria for each of my men to have a handful.”
9337	10	20	11	20	11	And the king of Israel replied, “Tell him: ‘The one putting on his armor should not boast like one taking it off.’”
9338	10	20	12	20	12	Ben-hadad received this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he said to his servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves against the city.
9339	10	20	13	20	13	Meanwhile a prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do you see this entire great army? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this very day, and you will know that I am the LORD.’”
9340	10	20	14	20	14	“By whom?” Ahab asked. And the prophet replied, “This is what the LORD says: ‘By the young officers of the district governors.’” “Who will start the battle?” asked Ahab. “You will,” answered the prophet.
9341	10	20	15	20	15	So Ahab assembled the young officers of the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all.
9342	10	20	16	20	16	They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
9343	10	20	17	20	17	And the young officers of the district governors marched out first. Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who reported to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”
9344	10	20	18	20	18	“If they have marched out in peace,” he said, “take them alive. Even if they have marched out for war, take them alive.”
9345	10	20	19	20	19	Meanwhile, these young officers of the district governors marched out of the city, with the army behind them,
9346	10	20	20	20	20	and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with the cavalry.
9347	10	20	21	20	21	Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter on the Arameans.
9348	10	20	22	20	22	Afterward, the prophet approached the king of Israel and said, “Go and strengthen your position, and take note what you must do, for in the spring the king of Aram will come up against you.”
9349	10	20	23	20	23	Meanwhile, the servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they prevailed over us. Instead, we should fight them on the plains; surely then we will prevail.
9350	10	20	24	20	24	So do this: Dismiss all the kings from their positions and replace them with other officers.
9351	10	20	25	20	25	And you must raise an army like the one you have lost—horse for horse and chariot for chariot—so we can fight the Israelites on the plain, where we will surely prevail.” And the king approved their plan and acted accordingly.
9352	10	20	26	20	26	In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
9353	10	20	27	20	27	The Israelites also mobilized, gathered supplies, and marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.
9354	10	20	28	20	28	Then the man of God approached the king of Israel and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not of the valleys, I will deliver all this great army into your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
9355	10	20	29	20	29	For seven days the armies camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle ensued, and the Israelites struck down the Arameans—a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.
9356	10	20	30	20	30	The rest of them fled into the city of Aphek, where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. Ben-hadad also fled to the city and hid in an inner room.
9357	10	20	31	20	31	Then the servants of Ben-hadad said to him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go out to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
9358	10	20	32	20	32	So with sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please spare my life.’” And the king answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
9359	10	20	33	20	33	Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, and they quickly grasped at this word and replied, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” “Go and get him!” said the king. Then Ben-hadad came out, and Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
9360	10	20	34	20	34	Ben-hadad said to him, “I will restore the cities my father took from your father; you may set up your own marketplaces in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” “By this treaty I release you,” Ahab replied. So he made a treaty with him and sent him away.
9361	10	20	35	20	35	Meanwhile, by the word of the LORD, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me, please!” But the man refused to strike him.
9362	10	20	36	20	36	Then the prophet said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you depart from me a lion will kill you.” And when he left, a lion found him and killed him.
9363	10	20	37	20	37	Then the prophet found another man and said, “Strike me, please!” So the man struck him and wounded him,
9364	10	20	38	20	38	and the prophet went and waited on the road for the king, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
9365	10	20	39	20	39	As the king passed by, he cried out to the king: “Your servant had marched out into the middle of the battle, when suddenly a man came over with a captive and told me, ‘Guard this man! If he goes missing for any reason, your life will be exchanged for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver.’
9366	10	20	40	20	40	But while your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.” And the king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you have pronounced it on yourself.”
9367	10	20	41	20	41	Then the prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
9368	10	20	42	20	42	And the prophet said to the king, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have let slip from your hand the man I had devoted to destruction, your life will be exchanged for his life, and your people for his people.’”
9369	10	20	43	20	43	Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went home to Samaria.
9370	10	21	1	21	1	Some time later, Naboth the Jezreelite happened to own a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
9371	10	21	2	21	2	So Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard to use as a vegetable garden, since it is next to my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in its place—or if you prefer, I will give you its value in silver.”
9372	10	21	3	21	3	But Naboth replied, “The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.”
9373	10	21	4	21	4	So Ahab went to his palace, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had told him, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He lay down on his bed, turned his face away, and refused to eat.
9374	10	21	5	21	5	Soon his wife Jezebel came in and asked, “Why are you so sullen that you refuse to eat?”
9375	10	21	6	21	6	Ahab answered, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and told him, ‘Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you another vineyard in its place.’ And he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard!’”
9376	10	21	7	21	7	But his wife Jezebel said to him, “Do you not reign over Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful, for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
9377	10	21	8	21	8	Then Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.
9378	10	21	9	21	9	In the letters she wrote: “Proclaim a fast and give Naboth a seat of honor among the people.
9379	10	21	10	21	10	But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify, ‘You have cursed both God and the king!’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”
9380	10	21	11	21	11	So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel had instructed in the letters she had written to them.
9381	10	21	12	21	12	They proclaimed a fast and gave Naboth a seat of honor among the people.
9382	10	21	13	21	13	And the two scoundrels came in and sat opposite Naboth, and these men testified against him before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed God and the king!” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
9383	10	21	14	21	14	Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
9384	10	21	15	21	15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to give it to you for silver. For Naboth is no longer alive, but dead.”
9385	10	21	16	21	16	And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
9386	10	21	17	21	17	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
9387	10	21	18	21	18	“Get up and go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. See, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, of which he has gone to take possession.
9388	10	21	19	21	19	Tell him that this is what the LORD says: ‘Have you not murdered a man and seized his land?’ Then tell him that this is also what the LORD says: ‘In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, there also the dogs will lick up your blood—yes, yours!’”
9389	10	21	20	21	20	When Elijah arrived, Ahab said to him, “So you have found me out, my enemy.” He replied, “I have found you out because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD.
9390	10	21	21	21	21	This is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring calamity on you and consume your descendants; I will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel, both slave and free.
9391	10	21	22	21	22	I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked My anger and caused Israel to sin.’
9392	10	21	23	21	23	And the LORD also speaks concerning Jezebel: ‘The dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’
9393	10	21	24	21	24	He who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and he who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.”
9394	10	21	25	21	25	(Surely there was never one like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD, incited by his wife Jezebel.
9395	10	21	26	21	26	He committed the most detestable acts by going after idols, just like the Amorites whom the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.)
9396	10	21	27	21	27	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth and walked around meekly.
9397	10	21	28	21	28	Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
9398	10	21	29	21	29	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the calamity during his days, but I will bring it upon his house in the days of his son.”
9399	10	22	1	22	1	Then three years passed without war between Aram and Israel.
9400	10	22	2	22	2	However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel,
9401	10	22	3	22	3	who said to his servants, “Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?”
9402	10	22	4	22	4	So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?” Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.”
9403	10	22	5	22	5	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
9404	10	22	6	22	6	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?” “Go up,” they replied, “and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
9405	10	22	7	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?”
9406	10	22	8	22	8	The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
9407	10	22	9	22	9	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
9408	10	22	10	22	10	Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
9409	10	22	11	22	11	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’”
9410	10	22	12	22	12	And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
9411	10	22	13	22	13	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
9412	10	22	14	22	14	But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me.”
9413	10	22	15	22	15	When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” “Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
9414	10	22	16	22	16	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
9415	10	22	17	22	17	So Micaiah declared: “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master; let each one return home in peace.’”
9416	10	22	18	22	18	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
9417	10	22	19	22	19	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and on His left.
9418	10	22	20	22	20	And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one suggested this, and another that.
9419	10	22	21	22	21	Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ ‘By what means?’ asked the LORD.
9420	10	22	22	22	22	And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ ‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’
9421	10	22	23	22	23	So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
9422	10	22	24	22	24	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
9423	10	22	25	22	25	Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
9424	10	22	26	22	26	And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
9425	10	22	27	22	27	and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’”
9426	10	22	28	22	28	But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!”
9427	10	22	29	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
9428	10	22	30	22	30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
9429	10	22	31	22	31	Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
9430	10	22	32	22	32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
9431	10	22	33	22	33	And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
9432	10	22	34	22	34	However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
9433	10	22	35	22	35	The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
9434	10	22	36	22	36	As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the army: “Every man to his own city, and every man to his own land!”
9435	10	22	37	22	37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where they buried him.
9436	10	22	38	22	38	And the chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up Ahab’s blood, according to the word that the LORD had spoken.
9437	10	22	39	22	39	As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, along with all his accomplishments and the ivory palace and all the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9438	10	22	40	22	40	And Ahab rested with his fathers, and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.
9439	10	22	41	22	41	In the fourth year of Ahab’s reign over Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah.
9440	10	22	42	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
9441	10	22	43	22	43	And Jehoshaphat walked in all the ways of his father Asa; he did not turn away from them, but did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
9442	10	22	44	22	43	The high places, however, were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
9443	10	22	45	22	44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
9444	10	22	46	22	45	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, along with the might he exercised and how he waged war, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9445	10	22	47	22	46	He banished from the land any male cult prostitutes who had remained from the days of his father Asa.
9446	10	22	48	22	47	And there was no king in Edom; a deputy served as king.
9447	10	22	49	22	48	Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail, because they were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
9448	10	22	50	22	49	At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants sail with your servants,” but Jehoshaphat refused.
9449	10	22	51	22	50	And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoram reigned in his place.
9450	10	22	52	22	51	In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria two years.
9451	10	22	53	22	52	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father and mother, and of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin.
9452	10	22	54	22	53	Ahaziah served and worshiped Baal, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.
9453	11	1	1	1	1	After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
9454	11	1	2	1	2	Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.”
9455	11	1	3	1	3	But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’
9456	11	1	4	1	4	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’” So Elijah departed.
9457	11	1	5	1	5	When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?”
9458	11	1	6	1	6	They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’”
9459	11	1	7	1	7	The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?”
9460	11	1	8	1	8	“He was a hairy man,” they answered, “with a leather belt around his waist.” “It is Elijah the Tishbite,” said the king.
9461	11	1	9	1	9	Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down!’”
9462	11	1	10	1	10	Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And fire came down from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
9463	11	1	11	1	11	So the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. And the captain said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down at once!’”
9464	11	1	12	1	12	Again Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
9465	11	1	13	1	13	So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. And the third captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, “Man of God, may my life and the lives of these fifty servants please be precious in your sight.
9466	11	1	14	1	14	Behold, fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty, with all their men. But now may my life be precious in your sight.”
9467	11	1	15	1	15	Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.” So Elijah arose and went down with him to the king.
9468	11	1	16	1	16	And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what the LORD says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.”
9469	11	1	17	1	17	So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah.
9470	11	1	18	1	18	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9471	11	2	1	2	1	Shortly before the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal,
9472	11	2	2	2	2	and Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
9473	11	2	3	2	3	Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
9474	11	2	4	2	4	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went to Jericho.
9475	11	2	5	2	5	Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?” “Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
9476	11	2	6	2	6	And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.
9477	11	2	7	2	7	Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing Elijah and Elisha as the two of them stood by the Jordan.
9478	11	2	8	2	8	And Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and to the left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
9479	11	2	9	2	9	After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?” “Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied.
9480	11	2	10	2	10	“You have requested a difficult thing,” said Elijah. “Nevertheless, if you see me as I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, then it will not be so.”
9481	11	2	11	2	11	As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind.
9482	11	2	12	2	12	As Elisha watched, he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And he saw Elijah no more. So taking hold of his own clothes, he tore them in two.
9483	11	2	13	2	13	Elisha also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
9484	11	2	14	2	14	Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the waters. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” he asked. And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over.
9485	11	2	15	2	15	When the sons of the prophets who were facing him from Jericho saw what had happened, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
9486	11	2	16	2	16	“Look now,” they said to Elisha, “we your servants have fifty valiant men. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.” “Do not send them,” Elisha replied.
9487	11	2	17	2	17	But when they pressed him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.” And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
9488	11	2	18	2	18	When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”
9489	11	2	19	2	19	Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please note, our lord, that the city’s location is good, as you can see. But the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.”
9490	11	2	20	2	20	“Bring me a new bowl,” he replied, “and put some salt in it.” So they brought it to him,
9491	11	2	21	2	21	and Elisha went out to the spring, cast the salt into it, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘I have healed this water. No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.’”
9492	11	2	22	2	22	And the waters there have been healthy to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha.
9493	11	2	23	2	23	From there, Elisha went up to Bethel, and as he was walking up the road, a group of boys came out of the city and jeered at him, chanting, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
9494	11	2	24	2	24	Then he turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
9495	11	2	25	2	25	And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
9496	11	3	1	3	1	In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twelve years.
9497	11	3	2	3	2	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.
9498	11	3	3	3	3	Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
9499	11	3	4	3	4	Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
9500	11	3	5	3	5	But after the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
9501	11	3	6	3	6	So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
9502	11	3	7	3	7	And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” “I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.”
9503	11	3	8	3	8	Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?” “By way of the Desert of Edom,” replied Joram.
9504	11	3	9	3	9	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or for their animals.
9505	11	3	10	3	10	“Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”
9506	11	3	11	3	11	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here? Let us inquire of the LORD through him.” And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”
9507	11	3	12	3	12	Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
9508	11	3	13	3	13	Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!” “No,” replied the king of Israel, “for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
9509	11	3	14	3	14	Then Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or acknowledge you.
9510	11	3	15	3	15	But now, bring me a harpist.” And while the harpist played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha
9511	11	3	16	3	16	and he said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’
9512	11	3	17	3	17	For the LORD says, ‘You will not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink—you and your cattle and your animals.’
9513	11	3	18	3	18	This is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD, and He will also deliver the Moabites into your hands.
9514	11	3	19	3	19	And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree, stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.”
9515	11	3	20	3	20	The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land.
9516	11	3	21	3	21	Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border.
9517	11	3	22	3	22	When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way.
9518	11	3	23	3	23	“This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!”
9519	11	3	24	3	24	But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the Moabites.
9520	11	3	25	3	25	They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
9521	11	3	26	3	26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail.
9522	11	3	27	3	27	So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. And there was great fury against the Israelites, so they withdrew and returned to their own land.
9523	11	4	1	4	1	Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And now his creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves!”
9524	11	4	2	4	2	“How can I help you?” asked Elisha. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?” She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”
9525	11	4	3	4	3	“Go,” said Elisha, “borrow jars, even empty ones, from all your neighbors. Do not gather just a few.
9526	11	4	4	4	4	Then go inside, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these jars, setting the full ones aside.”
9527	11	4	5	4	5	So she left him, and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing jars to her, and she kept pouring.
9528	11	4	6	4	6	When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another.” But he replied, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
9529	11	4	7	4	7	She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt. Then you and your sons can live on the remainder.”
9530	11	4	8	4	8	One day Elisha went to Shunem, and a prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to have a meal. So whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat.
9531	11	4	9	4	9	Then the woman said to her husband, “Behold, now I know that the one who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
9532	11	4	10	4	10	Please let us make a small room upstairs and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him. Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.”
9533	11	4	11	4	11	One day Elisha came to visit and went to his upper room to lie down.
9534	11	4	12	4	12	And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call the Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, she stood before him,
9535	11	4	13	4	13	and Elisha said to Gehazi, “Now tell her, ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’” “I have a home among my own people,” she replied.
9536	11	4	14	4	14	So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?” “Well, she has no son,” Gehazi replied, “and her husband is old.”
9537	11	4	15	4	15	“Call her,” said Elisha. So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway.
9538	11	4	16	4	16	And Elisha declared, “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.” “No, my lord,” she said. “Do not lie to your maidservant, O man of God.”
9539	11	4	17	4	17	But the woman did conceive, and at that time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
9540	11	4	18	4	18	And the child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the harvesters.
9541	11	4	19	4	19	“My head! My head!” he complained to his father. So his father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
9542	11	4	20	4	20	After the servant had picked him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.
9543	11	4	21	4	21	And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out.
9544	11	4	22	4	22	And the woman called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may go quickly to the man of God and return.”
9545	11	4	23	4	23	“Why would you go to him today?” he replied. “It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.” “Everything is all right,” she said.
9546	11	4	24	4	24	Then she saddled the donkey and told her servant, “Drive onward; do not slow the pace for me unless I tell you.”
9547	11	4	25	4	25	So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there is the Shunammite woman.
9548	11	4	26	4	26	Please run out now to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’” And she answered, “Everything is all right.”
9549	11	4	27	4	27	When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is in deep distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.”
9550	11	4	28	4	28	Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me?’”
9551	11	4	29	4	29	So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tie up your garment, take my staff in your hand, and go! If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Then lay my staff on the boy’s face.”
9552	11	4	30	4	30	And the mother of the boy said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.
9553	11	4	31	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”
9554	11	4	32	4	32	When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his bed.
9555	11	4	33	4	33	So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
9556	11	4	34	4	34	Then Elisha got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand. As he stretched himself out over him, the boy’s body became warm.
9557	11	4	35	4	35	Elisha turned away and paced back and forth across the room. Then he got on the bed and stretched himself out over the boy again, and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
9558	11	4	36	4	36	Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her and she came. Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.”
9559	11	4	37	4	37	She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out.
9560	11	4	38	4	38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his feet, he said to his attendant, “Put on the large pot and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets.”
9561	11	4	39	4	39	One of them went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment could hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.
9562	11	4	40	4	40	And they poured it out for the men to eat, but when they tasted the stew they cried out, “There is death in the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it.
9563	11	4	41	4	41	Then Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
9564	11	4	42	4	42	Now a man from Baal-shalishah came to the man of God with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread from the first ripe grain. “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha.
9565	11	4	43	4	43	But his servant asked, “How am I to set twenty loaves before a hundred men?” “Give it to the people to eat,” said Elisha, “for this is what the LORD says: ‘They will eat and have some left over.’”
9566	11	4	44	4	44	So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.
9567	11	5	1	5	1	Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
9568	11	5	2	5	2	At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife.
9569	11	5	3	5	3	She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”
9570	11	5	4	5	4	And Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
9571	11	5	5	5	5	“Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
9572	11	5	6	5	6	And the letter that he took to the king of Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
9573	11	5	7	5	7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life, that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he is seeking a quarrel with me!”
9574	11	5	8	5	8	Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
9575	11	5	9	5	9	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha’s house.
9576	11	5	10	5	10	Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”
9577	11	5	11	5	11	But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy.
9578	11	5	12	5	12	Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
9579	11	5	13	5	13	Naaman’s servants, however, approached him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’?”
9580	11	5	14	5	14	So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he was clean.
9581	11	5	15	5	15	Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “Now I know for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”
9582	11	5	16	5	16	But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused.
9583	11	5	17	5	17	“If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD.
9584	11	5	18	5	18	Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.”
9585	11	5	19	5	19	“Go in peace,” said Elisha. But after Naaman had traveled a short distance,
9586	11	5	20	5	20	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, while not accepting what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”
9587	11	5	21	5	21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
9588	11	5	22	5	22	“Everything is all right,” Gehazi replied. “My master has sent me to say, ‘I have just now discovered that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’”
9589	11	5	23	5	23	But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged Gehazi to accept them. Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
9590	11	5	24	5	24	When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from the servants and stored them in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they departed.
9591	11	5	25	5	25	When Gehazi went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Gehazi, where have you been?” “Your servant did not go anywhere,” he replied.
9592	11	5	26	5	26	But Elisha questioned him, “Did not my spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?
9593	11	5	27	5	27	Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants forever!” And as Gehazi left his presence, he was leprous—as white as snow.
9594	11	6	1	6	1	Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please take note that the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
9595	11	6	2	6	2	Please let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a log so we can build ourselves a place to live there.” “Go,” said Elisha.
9596	11	6	3	6	3	Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” “I will come,” he replied.
9597	11	6	4	6	4	So Elisha went with them, and when they came to the Jordan, they began to cut down some trees.
9598	11	6	5	6	5	As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe head fell into the water. “Oh, my master,” he cried out, “it was borrowed!”
9599	11	6	6	6	6	“Where did it fall?” asked the man of God. And when he showed him the place, the man of God cut a stick, threw it there, and made the iron float.
9600	11	6	7	6	7	“Lift it out,” he said, and the man reached out his hand and took it.
9601	11	6	8	6	8	Now the king of Aram was at war against Israel. After consulting with his servants, he said, “My camp will be in such and such a place.”
9602	11	6	9	6	9	Then the man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful passing by this place, for the Arameans are going down there.”
9603	11	6	10	6	10	So the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had pointed out. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.
9604	11	6	11	6	11	For this reason, the king of Aram became enraged and called his servants to demand of them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”
9605	11	6	12	6	12	But one of his servants replied, “No one, my lord the king. For Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.”
9606	11	6	13	6	13	So the king said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send men to capture him.” On receiving the report, “Elisha is in Dothan,”
9607	11	6	14	6	14	the king of Aram sent horses, chariots, and a great army. They went there by night and surrounded the city.
9608	11	6	15	6	15	When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early in the morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?”
9609	11	6	16	6	16	“Do not be afraid,” Elisha answered, “for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
9610	11	6	17	6	17	Then Elisha prayed, “O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.” And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
9611	11	6	18	6	18	As the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, “Please strike these people with blindness.” So He struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
9612	11	6	19	6	19	And Elisha told them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria.
9613	11	6	20	6	20	When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see.” Then the LORD opened their eyes, and they looked around and discovered that they were in Samaria.
9614	11	6	21	6	21	And when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”
9615	11	6	22	6	22	“Do not kill them,” he replied. “Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and then return to their master.”
9616	11	6	23	6	23	So the king prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. And the Aramean raiders did not come into the land of Israel again.
9617	11	6	24	6	24	Some time later, Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his entire army and marched up to besiege Samaria.
9618	11	6	25	6	25	So there was a great famine in Samaria. Indeed, they besieged the city so long that a donkey’s head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter cab of dove’s dung sold for five shekels of silver.
9619	11	6	26	6	26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help me, my lord the king!”
9620	11	6	27	6	27	He answered, “If the LORD does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or the winepress?”
9621	11	6	28	6	28	Then the king asked her, “What is the matter?” And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him, and tomorrow we will eat my son.’
9622	11	6	29	6	29	So we boiled my son and ate him, and the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.”
9623	11	6	30	6	30	When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by on the wall, the people saw the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin.
9624	11	6	31	6	31	He announced, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders through this day!”
9625	11	6	32	6	32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out. Is not the sound of his master’s footsteps behind him?”
9626	11	6	33	6	33	While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, “This calamity is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”
9627	11	7	1	7	1	Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the LORD says: ‘About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel.’”
9628	11	7	2	7	2	But the officer on whose arm the king leaned answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” “You will see it with your own eyes,” replied Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it.”
9629	11	7	3	7	3	Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another, “Why just sit here until we die?
9630	11	7	4	7	4	If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ we will die there from the famine in the city; but if we sit here, we will also die. So come now, let us go over to the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we will live; if they kill us, we will die.”
9631	11	7	5	7	5	So they arose at twilight and went to the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the outskirts of the camp, there was not a man to be found.
9632	11	7	6	7	6	For the LORD had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army, so that they said to each other, “Look, the king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.”
9633	11	7	7	7	7	Thus the Arameans had arisen and fled at twilight, abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys. The camp was intact, and they had run for their lives.
9634	11	7	8	7	8	When the lepers reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they carried off the silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. On returning, they entered another tent, carried off some items from there, and hid them.
9635	11	7	9	7	9	Finally, they said to one another, “We are not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until morning light, our sin will overtake us. Now, therefore, let us go and tell the king’s household.”
9636	11	7	10	7	10	So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city, saying, “We went to the Aramean camp and no one was there—not a trace—only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents were intact.”
9637	11	7	11	7	11	The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported to the king’s household.
9638	11	7	12	7	12	So the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving, so they have left the camp to hide in the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we will take them alive and enter the city.’”
9639	11	7	13	7	13	But one of his servants replied, “Please, have scouts take five of the horses that remain in the city. Their plight will be no worse than all the Israelites who are left here. You can see that all the Israelites here are doomed. So let us send them and find out.”
9640	11	7	14	7	14	Then the scouts took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go and see.”
9641	11	7	15	7	15	And they tracked them as far as the Jordan, and indeed, the whole way was littered with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown off in haste. So the scouts returned and told the king.
9642	11	7	16	7	16	Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. It was then that a seah of fine flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
9643	11	7	17	7	17	Now the king had appointed the officer on whose arm he leaned to be in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king had come to him.
9644	11	7	18	7	18	It happened just as the man of God had told the king: “About this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria, two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel.”
9645	11	7	19	7	19	And the officer had answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” So Elisha had replied, “You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!”
9646	11	7	20	7	20	And this is just what happened to him. The people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
9647	11	8	1	8	1	Now Elisha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, you and your household; go and live as a foreigner wherever you can. For the LORD has decreed a seven-year famine, and it has already come to the land.”
9648	11	8	2	8	2	So the woman got ready and did as the man of God had instructed. She and her household lived as foreigners for seven years in the land of the Philistines.
9649	11	8	3	8	3	At the end of seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to the king to appeal for her house and her land.
9650	11	8	4	8	4	Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things Elisha has done.”
9651	11	8	5	8	5	And Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life. Just then, the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land. So Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha restored to life.”
9652	11	8	6	8	6	When the king asked the woman, she confirmed it. So the king appointed for her an officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, along with all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the country until now.”
9653	11	8	7	8	7	Then Elisha came to Damascus while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and the king was told, “The man of God has come here.”
9654	11	8	8	8	8	So the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand, go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’”
9655	11	8	9	8	9	So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift of forty camel loads of every good thing from Damascus. And he went in and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’”
9656	11	8	10	8	10	Elisha answered, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover.’ But the LORD has shown me that in fact he will die.”
9657	11	8	11	8	11	Elisha fixed his gaze steadily on him until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the man of God began to weep.
9658	11	8	12	8	12	“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael. “Because I know the evil you will do to the Israelites,” Elisha replied. “You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.”
9659	11	8	13	8	13	“But how could your servant, a mere dog, do such a monstrous thing?” said Hazael. And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown me that you will be king over Aram.”
9660	11	8	14	8	14	So Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he replied, “He told me that you would surely recover.”
9661	11	8	15	8	15	But the next day Hazael took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king’s face. So Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned in his place.
9662	11	8	16	8	16	In the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat succeeded his father as king of Judah.
9663	11	8	17	8	17	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
9664	11	8	18	8	18	And Jehoram walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD.
9665	11	8	19	8	19	Yet for the sake of His servant David, the LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah, since He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
9666	11	8	20	8	20	In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king.
9667	11	8	21	8	21	So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked by night. His troops, however, fled to their homes.
9668	11	8	22	8	22	So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same time.
9669	11	8	23	8	23	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoram, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9670	11	8	24	8	24	And Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.
9671	11	8	25	8	25	In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab over Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
9672	11	8	26	8	26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
9673	11	8	27	8	27	And Ahaziah walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
9674	11	8	28	8	28	Then Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram.
9675	11	8	29	8	29	So King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded.
9676	11	9	1	9	1	Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak under your belt, take this flask of oil, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
9677	11	9	2	9	2	When you arrive, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in, get him away from his companions, and take him to an inner room.
9678	11	9	3	9	3	Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and declare, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run. Do not delay!”
9679	11	9	4	9	4	So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead,
9680	11	9	5	9	5	and when he arrived, the army commanders were sitting there. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said. “For which of us?” asked Jehu. “For you, commander,” he replied.
9681	11	9	6	9	6	So Jehu got up and went into the house, where the young prophet poured the oil on his head and declared, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the LORD’s people Israel.
9682	11	9	7	9	7	And you are to strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD shed by the hand of Jezebel.
9683	11	9	8	9	8	The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off from Ahab all the males in Israel, both slave and free.
9684	11	9	9	9	9	I will make the house of Ahab like the houses of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.
9685	11	9	10	9	10	And on the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour Jezebel, and there will be no one to bury her.’” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.
9686	11	9	11	9	11	When Jehu went out to the servants of his master, they asked, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?” “You know his kind and their babble,” he replied.
9687	11	9	12	9	12	“That is a lie!” they said. “Tell us now!” So Jehu answered, “He talked to me about this and that, and he said, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’”
9688	11	9	13	9	13	Quickly, each man took his garment and put it under Jehu on the bare steps. Then they blew the ram’s horn and proclaimed, “Jehu is king!”
9689	11	9	14	9	14	Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram,
9690	11	9	15	9	15	but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had suffered at the hands of the Arameans in the battle against Hazael their king.) So Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to make me king, then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.”
9691	11	9	16	9	16	Then Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel, because Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
9692	11	9	17	9	17	Now the watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, and he called out, “I see a company of troops!” “Choose a rider,” Joram commanded. “Send him out to meet them and ask, ‘Have you come in peace?’”
9693	11	9	18	9	18	So a horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’” “What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.” And the watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”
9694	11	9	19	9	19	So the king sent out a second horseman, who went to them and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’” “What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”
9695	11	9	20	9	20	Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the charioteer is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi—he is driving like a madman!”
9696	11	9	21	9	21	“Harness!” Joram shouted, and they harnessed his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
9697	11	9	22	9	22	When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?” “How can there be peace,” he replied, “as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
9698	11	9	23	9	23	Joram turned around and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
9699	11	9	24	9	24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
9700	11	9	25	9	25	And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember that when you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab, the LORD lifted up this burden against him:
9701	11	9	26	9	26	‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, declares the LORD, so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.’ Now then, according to the word of the LORD, pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground.”
9702	11	9	27	9	27	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot him, too!” So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot on the Ascent of Gur, near Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo and died there.
9703	11	9	28	9	28	Then his servants carried him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.
9704	11	9	29	9	29	(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.)
9705	11	9	30	9	30	Now when Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. So she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked down from a window.
9706	11	9	31	9	31	And as Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, O Zimri, murderer of your master?”
9707	11	9	32	9	32	He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
9708	11	9	33	9	33	“Throw her down!” yelled Jehu. So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
9709	11	9	34	9	34	Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of this cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was the daughter of a king.”
9710	11	9	35	9	35	But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
9711	11	9	36	9	36	So they went back and told Jehu, who replied, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite: ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.
9712	11	9	37	9	37	And Jezebel’s body will lie like dung in the field on the plot of ground at Jezreel, so that no one can say: This is Jezebel.’”
9713	11	10	1	10	1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying:
9714	11	10	2	10	2	“When this letter arrives, since your master’s sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weaponry,
9715	11	10	3	10	3	select the best and most worthy son of your master, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”
9716	11	10	4	10	4	But they were terrified and reasoned, “If two kings could not stand against him, how can we?”
9717	11	10	5	10	5	So the palace administrator, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your sight.”
9718	11	10	6	10	6	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter and said: “If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, then bring the heads of your master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now the sons of the king, seventy in all, were being brought up by the leading men of the city.
9719	11	10	7	10	7	And when the letter arrived, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
9720	11	10	8	10	8	When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.” And Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
9721	11	10	9	10	9	The next morning, Jehu went out and stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?
9722	11	10	10	10	10	Know, then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail, for the LORD has done what He promised through His servant Elijah.”
9723	11	10	11	10	11	So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his great men and close friends and priests, leaving him without a single survivor.
9724	11	10	12	10	12	Then Jehu set out toward Samaria. At Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
9725	11	10	13	10	13	Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” “We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered, “and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.”
9726	11	10	14	10	14	Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.” So his men took them alive, then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked—forty-two men. He spared none of them.
9727	11	10	15	10	15	When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?” “It is!” Jehonadab replied. “If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped him into his chariot,
9728	11	10	16	10	16	saying, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD!” So he had him ride in his chariot.
9729	11	10	17	10	17	When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down everyone belonging to Ahab who remained there, until he had destroyed them, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to Elijah.
9730	11	10	18	10	18	Then Jehu brought all the people together and said, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot.
9731	11	10	19	10	19	Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. See that no one is missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing will not live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
9732	11	10	20	10	20	And Jehu commanded, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they called one.
9733	11	10	21	10	21	Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to show up. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from end to end.
9734	11	10	22	10	22	And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out garments for them.
9735	11	10	23	10	23	Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around to see that there are no servants of the LORD here among you—only servants of Baal.”
9736	11	10	24	10	24	And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and warned them, “If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into your hands to escape, he will forfeit his life for theirs.”
9737	11	10	25	10	25	When he had finished making the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them. Do not let anyone out.” So the guards and officers struck them down with the sword, threw the bodies out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.
9738	11	10	26	10	26	They brought out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it,
9739	11	10	27	10	27	and they demolished the sacred pillar of Baal. Then they tore down the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine, which it is to this day.
9740	11	10	28	10	28	Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel,
9741	11	10	29	10	29	but he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
9742	11	10	30	10	30	Nevertheless, the LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”
9743	11	10	31	10	31	Yet Jehu was not careful to follow the instruction of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.
9744	11	10	32	10	32	In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory
9745	11	10	33	10	33	from the Jordan eastward through all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh), and from Aroer by the Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan.
9746	11	10	34	10	34	As for the rest of the acts of Jehu, along with all his accomplishments and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9747	11	10	35	10	35	And Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.
9748	11	10	36	10	36	So the duration of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
9749	11	11	1	11	1	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs.
9750	11	11	2	11	2	But Jehosheba daughter of King Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah, and he was not killed.
9751	11	11	3	11	3	And Joash remained hidden with his nurse in the house of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
9752	11	11	4	11	4	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards, and had them brought into the house of the LORD. There he made a covenant with them and put them under oath. He showed them the king’s son
9753	11	11	5	11	5	and commanded them, “This is what you are to do: A third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the royal palace,
9754	11	11	6	11	6	a third shall be at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the guards. You are to take turns guarding the temple—
9755	11	11	7	11	7	the two divisions that would go off duty on the Sabbath are to guard the house of the LORD for the king.
9756	11	11	8	11	8	You must surround the king with weapons in hand, and anyone who approaches the ranks must be put to death. You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.”
9757	11	11	9	11	9	So the commanders of hundreds did everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest.
9758	11	11	10	11	10	Then the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields of King David from the house of the LORD.
9759	11	11	11	11	11	And the guards stood with weapons in hand surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
9760	11	11	12	11	12	Then Jehoiada brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and declared, “Long live the king!”
9761	11	11	13	11	13	When Athaliah heard the noise from the guards and the people, she went out to the people in the house of the LORD.
9762	11	11	14	11	14	And she looked out and saw the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom. The officers and trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason! Treason!”
9763	11	11	15	11	15	And Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
9764	11	11	16	11	16	So they seized Athaliah as she reached the horses’ entrance to the palace grounds, and there she was put to death.
9765	11	11	17	11	17	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
9766	11	11	18	11	18	So all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols into pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. And Jehoiada the priest posted guards for the house of the LORD.
9767	11	11	19	11	19	He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered the royal palace by way of the gate of the guards. Then Joash took his seat on the royal throne,
9768	11	11	20	11	20	and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been put to the sword at the royal palace.
9769	11	12	1	11	21	Joash was seven years old when he became king.
9770	11	12	2	12	1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
9771	11	12	3	12	2	And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days he was instructed by Jehoiada the priest.
9772	11	12	4	12	3	Nevertheless, the high places were not removed; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.
9773	11	12	5	12	4	Then Joash said to the priests, “Collect all the money brought as sacred gifts into the house of the LORD—the census money, the money from vows, and the money brought voluntarily into the house of the LORD.
9774	11	12	6	12	5	Let every priest receive it from his constituency, and let it be used to repair any damage found in the temple.”
9775	11	12	7	12	6	But by the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, the priests had not repaired the damage to the temple.
9776	11	12	8	12	7	So King Joash called Jehoiada and the other priests and said, “Why have you not repaired the damage in the temple? Now, therefore, take no more money from your constituency, but hand it over for the repair of the temple.”
9777	11	12	9	12	8	So the priests agreed that they would not receive money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.
9778	11	12	10	12	9	Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the house of the LORD. There the priests who guarded the threshold put all the money brought into the house of the LORD.
9779	11	12	11	12	10	Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal scribe and the high priest would go up, count the money brought into the house of the LORD, and tie it up in bags.
9780	11	12	12	12	11	Then they would put the counted money into the hands of those who supervised the work on the house of the LORD, who in turn would pay those doing the work—the carpenters, builders,
9781	11	12	13	12	12	masons, and stonecutters. They also purchased timber and dressed stone to repair the damage to the house of the LORD, and they paid the other expenses of the temple repairs.
9782	11	12	14	12	13	However, the money brought into the house of the LORD was not used for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver for the house of the LORD.
9783	11	12	15	12	14	Instead, it was paid to those doing the work, and with it they repaired the house of the LORD.
9784	11	12	16	12	15	No accounting was required from the men who received the money to pay the workmen, because they acted with integrity.
9785	11	12	17	12	16	The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.
9786	11	12	18	12	17	At that time Hazael king of Aram marched up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he decided to attack Jerusalem.
9787	11	12	19	12	18	So King Joash of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathers—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—along with his own consecrated items and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram. So Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.
9788	11	12	20	12	19	As for the rest of the acts of Joash, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9789	11	12	21	12	20	And the servants of Joash rose up and formed a conspiracy and killed him at Beth-millo, on the road down to Silla.
9790	11	12	22	12	21	His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer struck him down, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah reigned in his place.
9791	11	13	1	13	1	In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash son of Ahaziah over Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria seventeen years.
9792	11	13	2	13	2	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
9793	11	13	3	13	3	So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-hadad.
9794	11	13	4	13	4	Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him because He saw the oppression that the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel.
9795	11	13	5	13	5	So the LORD gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped the power of the Arameans. Then the people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before.
9796	11	13	6	13	6	Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins that the house of Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, but they continued to walk in them. The Asherah pole even remained standing in Samaria.
9797	11	13	7	13	7	Jehoahaz had no army left, except fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
9798	11	13	8	13	8	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, along with all his accomplishments and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9799	11	13	9	13	9	And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And his son Jehoash reigned in his place.
9800	11	13	10	13	10	In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of Joash over Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
9801	11	13	11	13	11	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, but he walked in them.
9802	11	13	12	13	12	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with all his accomplishments and his might, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9803	11	13	13	13	13	And Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
9804	11	13	14	13	14	When Elisha had fallen sick with the illness from which he would die, Jehoash king of Israel came down to him and wept over him, saying, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
9805	11	13	15	13	15	Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So Jehoash took a bow and some arrows.
9806	11	13	16	13	16	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So the king put his hand on the bow, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
9807	11	13	17	13	17	“Open the east window,” said Elisha. So he opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot!” So he shot. And Elisha declared: “This is the LORD’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram, for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek until you have put an end to them.”
9808	11	13	18	13	18	Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows!” So he took them, and Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” So he struck the ground three times and stopped.
9809	11	13	19	13	19	But the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to it. But now you will strike down Aram only three times.”
9810	11	13	20	13	20	And Elisha died and was buried. Now the Moabite raiders used to come into the land every spring.
9811	11	13	21	13	21	Once, as the Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders, so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. And as soon as his body touched the bones of Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet.
9812	11	13	22	13	22	And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
9813	11	13	23	13	23	But the LORD was gracious to Israel and had compassion on them, and He turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And to this day, the LORD has been unwilling to destroy them or cast them from His presence.
9814	11	13	24	13	24	When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad reigned in his place.
9815	11	13	25	13	25	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times, and so recovered the cities of Israel.
9816	11	14	1	14	1	In the second year of the reign of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz over Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah.
9817	11	14	2	14	2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
9818	11	14	3	14	3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done. He did everything as his father Joash had done.
9819	11	14	4	14	4	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away, and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
9820	11	14	5	14	5	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king.
9821	11	14	6	14	6	Yet he did not put the sons of the murderers to death, but acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.”
9822	11	14	7	14	7	Amaziah struck down 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He took Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, which is its name to this very day.
9823	11	14	8	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said.
9824	11	14	9	14	9	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
9825	11	14	10	14	10	You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Glory in that and stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”
9826	11	14	11	14	11	But Amaziah would not listen, and Jehoash king of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced one another at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
9827	11	14	12	14	12	And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his home.
9828	11	14	13	14	13	There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits.
9829	11	14	14	14	14	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
9830	11	14	15	14	15	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with his accomplishments, his might, and how he waged war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9831	11	14	16	14	16	And Jehoash rested with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place.
9832	11	14	17	14	17	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
9833	11	14	18	14	18	As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9834	11	14	19	14	19	And conspirators plotted against Amaziah in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.
9835	11	14	20	14	20	They carried him back on horses and buried him in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.
9836	11	14	21	14	21	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
9837	11	14	22	14	22	Azariah was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.
9838	11	14	23	14	23	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah son of Joash over Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria forty-one years.
9839	11	14	24	14	24	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
9840	11	14	25	14	25	This Jeroboam restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word that the LORD, the God of Israel, had spoken through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher.
9841	11	14	26	14	26	For the LORD saw that the affliction of the Israelites, both slave and free, was very bitter. There was no one to help Israel,
9842	11	14	27	14	27	and since the LORD had said that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
9843	11	14	28	14	28	As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, along with all his accomplishments and might, and how he waged war and recovered both Damascus and Hamath for Israel from Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9844	11	14	29	14	29	And Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And his son Zechariah reigned in his place.
9845	11	15	1	15	1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah.
9846	11	15	2	15	2	He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
9847	11	15	3	15	3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
9848	11	15	4	15	4	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.
9849	11	15	5	15	5	And the LORD afflicted the king with leprosy until the day he died, so that he lived in a separate house while his son Jotham had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
9850	11	15	6	15	6	As for the rest of the acts of Azariah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9851	11	15	7	15	7	And Azariah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in the City of David. And his son Jotham reigned in his place.
9852	11	15	8	15	8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria six months.
9853	11	15	9	15	9	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
9854	11	15	10	15	10	Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, struck him down and killed him in front of the people, and reigned in his place.
9855	11	15	11	15	11	As for the rest of the acts of Zechariah, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
9856	11	15	12	15	12	So the word of the LORD spoken to Jehu was fulfilled: “Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”
9857	11	15	13	15	13	In the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah’s reign over Judah, Shallum son of Jabesh became king, and he reigned in Samaria one full month.
9858	11	15	14	15	14	Then Menahem son of Gadi went up from Tirzah to Samaria, struck down and killed Shallum son of Jabesh, and reigned in his place.
9859	11	15	15	15	15	As for the rest of the acts of Shallum, along with the conspiracy he led, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
9860	11	15	16	15	16	At that time Menahem, starting from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and everyone in its vicinity, because they would not open their gates. So he attacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women.
9861	11	15	17	15	17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years.
9862	11	15	18	15	18	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and throughout his reign he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
9863	11	15	19	15	19	Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver in order to gain his support and strengthen his own grip on the kingdom.
9864	11	15	20	15	20	Menahem exacted this money from each of the wealthy men of Israel—fifty shekels of silver from each man—to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not remain in the land.
9865	11	15	21	15	21	As for the rest of the acts of Menahem, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
9866	11	15	22	15	22	And Menahem rested with his fathers, and his son Pekahiah reigned in his place.
9867	11	15	23	15	23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel and reigned in Samaria two years.
9868	11	15	24	15	24	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
9869	11	15	25	15	25	Then his officer, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him along with Argob, Arieh, and fifty men of Gilead. And at the citadel of the king’s palace in Samaria, Pekah struck down and killed Pekahiah and reigned in his place.
9870	11	15	26	15	26	As for the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, along with all his accomplishments, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
9871	11	15	27	15	27	In the fifty-second year of Azariah’s reign over Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twenty years.
9872	11	15	28	15	28	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
9873	11	15	29	15	29	In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and he took the people as captives to Assyria.
9874	11	15	30	15	30	Then Hoshea son of Elah led a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remaliah. In the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah, Hoshea attacked Pekah, killed him, and reigned in his place.
9875	11	15	31	15	31	As for the rest of the acts of Pekah, along with all his accomplishments, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
9876	11	15	32	15	32	In the second year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah over Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah.
9877	11	15	33	15	33	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
9878	11	15	34	15	34	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done.
9879	11	15	35	15	35	Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD.
9880	11	15	36	15	36	As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9881	11	15	37	15	37	(In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.)
9882	11	15	38	15	38	And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David his father. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.
9883	11	16	1	16	1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah.
9884	11	16	2	16	2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
9885	11	16	3	16	3	Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
9886	11	16	4	16	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
9887	11	16	5	16	5	Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.
9888	11	16	6	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, drove out the men of Judah, and sent the Edomites into Elath, where they live to this day.
9889	11	16	7	16	7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hands of the kings of Aram and Israel, who are rising up against me.”
9890	11	16	8	16	8	Ahaz also took the silver and gold found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s palace, and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
9891	11	16	9	16	9	So the king of Assyria responded to him, marched up to Damascus, and captured it. He took its people to Kir as captives and put Rezin to death.
9892	11	16	10	16	10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria. On seeing the altar in Damascus, King Ahaz sent Uriah the priest a model of the altar and complete plans for its construction.
9893	11	16	11	16	11	And Uriah the priest built the altar according to all the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, and he completed it by the time King Ahaz had returned.
9894	11	16	12	16	12	When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it.
9895	11	16	13	16	13	He offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
9896	11	16	14	16	14	He also took the bronze altar that stood before the LORD from the front of the temple (between the new altar and the house of the LORD) and he put it on the north side of the new altar.
9897	11	16	15	16	15	Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, “Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and grain offering, as well as the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings of all the people of the land. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar to seek guidance.”
9898	11	16	16	16	16	So Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had commanded.
9899	11	16	17	16	17	King Ahaz also cut off the frames of the movable stands and removed the bronze basin from each of them. He took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone base.
9900	11	16	18	16	18	And on account of the king of Assyria, he removed the Sabbath canopy they had built in the temple and closed the royal entryway outside the house of the LORD.
9901	11	16	19	16	19	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
9902	11	16	20	16	20	And Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David, and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
9903	11	17	1	17	1	In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahaz over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria nine years.
9904	11	17	2	17	2	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.
9905	11	17	3	17	3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute.
9906	11	17	4	17	4	But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea had conspired to send envoys to King So of Egypt, and that he had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria as in previous years. Therefore the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea and put him in prison.
9907	11	17	5	17	5	Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
9908	11	17	6	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried away the Israelites to Assyria, where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
9909	11	17	7	17	7	All this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods
9910	11	17	8	17	8	and walked in the customs of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites, as well as in the practices introduced by the kings of Israel.
9911	11	17	9	17	9	The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city, they built high places in all their cities.
9912	11	17	10	17	10	They set up for themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
9913	11	17	11	17	11	They burned incense on all the high places like the nations that the LORD had driven out before them. They did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger.
9914	11	17	12	17	12	They served idols, although the LORD had told them, “You shall not do this thing.”
9915	11	17	13	17	13	Yet through all His prophets and seers, the LORD warned Israel and Judah, saying, “Turn from your wicked ways and keep My commandments and statutes, according to the entire Law that I commanded your fathers and delivered to you through My servants the prophets.”
9916	11	17	14	17	14	But they would not listen, and they stiffened their necks like their fathers, who did not believe the LORD their God.
9917	11	17	15	17	15	They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and themselves became worthless, going after the surrounding nations that the LORD had commanded them not to imitate.
9918	11	17	16	17	16	They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves two cast idols of calves and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the host of heaven and served Baal.
9919	11	17	17	17	17	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire and practiced divination and soothsaying. They devoted themselves to doing evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.
9920	11	17	18	17	18	So the LORD was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained,
9921	11	17	19	17	19	and even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced.
9922	11	17	20	17	20	So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers, until He had banished them from His presence.
9923	11	17	21	17	21	When the LORD had torn Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin.
9924	11	17	22	17	22	The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed and did not turn away from them.
9925	11	17	23	17	23	Finally, the LORD removed Israel from His presence, as He had declared through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their homeland into Assyria, where they are to this day.
9926	11	17	24	17	24	Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns.
9927	11	17	25	17	25	Now when the settlers first lived there, they did not worship the LORD, so He sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
9928	11	17	26	17	26	So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The peoples that you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Because of this, He has sent lions among them, which are indeed killing them off.”
9929	11	17	27	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded: “Send back one of the priests you carried off from Samaria, and have him go back to live there and teach the requirements of the God of the land.”
9930	11	17	28	17	28	Thus one of the priests they had carried away came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should worship the LORD.
9931	11	17	29	17	29	Nevertheless, the people of each nation continued to make their own gods in the cities where they had settled, and they set them up in the shrines that the people of Samaria had made on the high places.
9932	11	17	30	17	30	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
9933	11	17	31	17	31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of the Sepharvaim.
9934	11	17	32	17	32	So the new residents worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts to serve in the shrines of the high places.
9935	11	17	33	17	33	They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations from which they had been carried away.
9936	11	17	34	17	34	To this day they are still practicing their former customs. None of them worship the LORD or observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom He named Israel.
9937	11	17	35	17	35	For the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites and commanded them, “Do not worship other gods or bow down to them; do not serve them or sacrifice to them.
9938	11	17	36	17	36	Instead, worship the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him and offer sacrifices to Him.
9939	11	17	37	17	37	And you must always be careful to observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments He wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
9940	11	17	38	17	38	Do not forget the covenant I have made with you. Do not worship other gods,
9941	11	17	39	17	39	but worship the LORD your God, and He will deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.”
9942	11	17	40	17	40	But they would not listen, and they persisted in their former customs.
9943	11	17	41	17	41	So these nations worshiped the LORD but also served their idols, and to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did.
9944	11	18	1	18	1	In the third year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah.
9945	11	18	2	18	2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
9946	11	18	3	18	3	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.
9947	11	18	4	18	4	He removed the high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He also demolished the bronze snake called Nehushtan that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had burned incense to it.
9948	11	18	5	18	5	Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. No king of Judah was like him, either before him or after him.
9949	11	18	6	18	6	He remained faithful to the LORD and did not turn from following Him; he kept the commandments that the LORD had given Moses.
9950	11	18	7	18	7	And the LORD was with Hezekiah, and he prospered wherever he went. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him.
9951	11	18	8	18	8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city.
9952	11	18	9	18	9	In the fourth year of Hezekiah’s reign, which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and besieged it.
9953	11	18	10	18	10	And at the end of three years, the Assyrians captured it. So Samaria was captured in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
9954	11	18	11	18	11	The king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
9955	11	18	12	18	12	This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD their God, but violated His covenant—all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded—and would neither listen nor obey.
9956	11	18	13	18	13	In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah.
9957	11	18	14	18	14	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand from me.” And the king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
9958	11	18	15	18	15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
9959	11	18	16	18	16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold with which he had plated the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD, and he gave it to the king of Assyria.
9960	11	18	17	18	17	Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh, along with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced up to Jerusalem and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
9961	11	18	18	18	18	Then they called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them.
9962	11	18	19	18	19	The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours?
9963	11	18	20	18	20	You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me?
9964	11	18	21	18	21	Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
9965	11	18	22	18	22	But if you say to me: ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem: ‘You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?
9966	11	18	23	18	23	Now, therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
9967	11	18	24	18	24	For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
9968	11	18	25	18	25	So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”
9969	11	18	26	18	26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak with us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
9970	11	18	27	18	27	But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
9971	11	18	28	18	28	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
9972	11	18	29	18	29	This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you; he cannot deliver you from my hand.
9973	11	18	30	18	30	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely rescue us; this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
9974	11	18	31	18	31	Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern,
9975	11	18	32	18	32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey—so that you may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’
9976	11	18	33	18	33	Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
9977	11	18	34	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
9978	11	18	35	18	35	Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
9979	11	18	36	18	36	But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
9980	11	18	37	18	37	Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh.
9981	11	19	1	19	1	On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD.
9982	11	19	2	19	2	Then he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
9983	11	19	3	19	3	to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for the children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them.
9984	11	19	4	19	4	Perhaps the LORD your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.”
9985	11	19	5	19	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
9986	11	19	6	19	6	who replied, “Tell your master that this is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
9987	11	19	7	19	7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”
9988	11	19	8	19	8	When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
9989	11	19	9	19	9	Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush: “Look, he has set out to fight against you.” So again Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah with the order:
9990	11	19	10	19	10	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
9991	11	19	11	19	11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction. Will you then be spared?
9992	11	19	12	19	12	Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers rescue those nations—the gods of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and of the people of Eden in Telassar?
9993	11	19	13	19	13	Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
9994	11	19	14	19	14	So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
9995	11	19	15	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD: “O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
9996	11	19	16	19	16	Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see. Listen to the words that Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God.
9997	11	19	17	19	17	Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste these nations and their lands.
9998	11	19	18	19	18	They have cast their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone—the work of human hands.
9999	11	19	19	19	19	And now, O LORD our God, please save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.”
10000	11	19	20	19	20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
10001	11	19	21	19	21	This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: ‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.
10002	11	19	22	19	22	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
10003	11	19	23	19	23	Through your servants you have taunted the Lord and you have said: “With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the remote peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses. I have reached its farthest outposts, the densest of its forests.
10004	11	19	24	19	24	I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
10005	11	19	25	19	25	Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it; in days of old I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.
10006	11	19	26	19	26	Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, tender green shoots, grass on the rooftops, scorched before it is grown.
10007	11	19	27	19	27	But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against Me.
10008	11	19	28	19	28	Because your rage and arrogance against Me have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will send you back the way you came.’
10009	11	19	29	19	29	And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what springs from the same. But in the third year you will sow and reap; you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
10010	11	19	30	19	30	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below and bear fruit above.
10011	11	19	31	19	31	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
10012	11	19	32	19	32	So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow into it. He will not come before it with a shield or build up a siege ramp against it.
10013	11	19	33	19	33	He will go back the way he came, and he will not enter this city,’ declares the LORD.
10014	11	19	34	19	34	‘I will defend this city and save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
10015	11	19	35	19	35	And that very night the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!
10016	11	19	36	19	36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
10017	11	19	37	19	37	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place.
10018	11	20	1	20	1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.”
10019	11	20	2	20	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
10020	11	20	3	20	3	“Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
10021	11	20	4	20	4	Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
10022	11	20	5	20	5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. I will surely heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the house of the LORD.
10023	11	20	6	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for My sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
10024	11	20	7	20	7	Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of figs.” So they brought it and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
10025	11	20	8	20	8	Now Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?”
10026	11	20	9	20	9	And Isaiah replied, “This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: Would you like the shadow to go forward ten steps, or back ten steps?”
10027	11	20	10	20	10	“It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps,” answered Hezekiah, “but not for it to go back ten steps.”
10028	11	20	11	20	11	So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD, and He brought the shadow back the ten steps it had descended on the stairway of Ahaz.
10029	11	20	12	20	12	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah’s illness.
10030	11	20	13	20	13	And Hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil—along with his armory and everything that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
10031	11	20	14	20	14	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?” “They came from a distant land,” Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.”
10032	11	20	15	20	15	“What have they seen in your palace?” Isaiah asked. “They have seen everything in my palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
10033	11	20	16	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD:
10034	11	20	17	20	17	The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
10035	11	20	18	20	18	And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
10036	11	20	19	20	19	But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Will there not at least be peace and security in my lifetime?”
10037	11	20	20	20	20	As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, along with all his might and how he constructed the pool and the tunnel to bring water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
10038	11	20	21	20	21	And Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and his son Manasseh reigned in his place.
10039	11	21	1	21	1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
10040	11	21	2	21	2	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD by following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
10041	11	21	3	21	3	For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal. He made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, and he worshiped and served all the host of heaven.
10042	11	21	4	21	4	Manasseh also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put My Name.”
10043	11	21	5	21	5	In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven.
10044	11	21	6	21	6	He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.
10045	11	21	7	21	7	Manasseh even took the carved Asherah pole he had made and set it up in the temple, of which the LORD had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish My Name forever.
10046	11	21	8	21	8	I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they are careful to do all I have commanded them—the whole Law that My servant Moses commanded them.”
10047	11	21	9	21	9	But the people did not listen and Manasseh led them astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
10048	11	21	10	21	10	And the LORD spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,
10049	11	21	11	21	11	“Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed all these abominations, acting more wickedly than the Amorites who preceded him, and with his idols has caused Judah to sin,
10050	11	21	12	21	12	this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah that the news will reverberate in the ears of all who hear it.
10051	11	21	13	21	13	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab, and I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a bowl—wiping it and turning it upside down.
10052	11	21	14	21	14	So I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
10053	11	21	15	21	15	because they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this day.’”
10054	11	21	16	21	16	Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
10055	11	21	17	21	17	As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with all his accomplishments and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
10056	11	21	18	21	18	And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.
10057	11	21	19	21	19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
10058	11	21	20	21	20	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.
10059	11	21	21	21	21	He walked in all the ways of his father, and he served and worshiped the idols his father had served.
10060	11	21	22	21	22	He abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
10061	11	21	23	21	23	Then the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his palace.
10062	11	21	24	21	24	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
10063	11	21	25	21	25	As for the rest of the acts of Amon, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
10064	11	21	26	21	26	And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah reigned in his place.
10065	11	22	1	22	1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath.
10066	11	22	2	22	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
10067	11	22	3	22	3	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the scribe, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the LORD, saying,
10068	11	22	4	22	4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
10069	11	22	5	22	5	And let them deliver it into the hands of the supervisors of those doing the work on the house of the LORD, who in turn are to give it to the workmen repairing the damages to the house of the LORD—
10070	11	22	6	22	6	to the carpenters, builders, and masons—to buy timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.
10071	11	22	7	22	7	But they need not account for the money put into their hands, since they work with integrity.”
10072	11	22	8	22	8	Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan, who read it.
10073	11	22	9	22	9	And Shaphan the scribe went to the king and reported, “Your servants have paid out the money that was found in the temple and have put it into the hands of the workers and supervisors of the house of the LORD.”
10074	11	22	10	22	10	Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
10075	11	22	11	22	11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes
10076	11	22	12	22	12	and commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king:
10077	11	22	13	22	13	“Go and inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words in this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book by doing all that is written about us.”
10078	11	22	14	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went and spoke to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
10079	11	22	15	22	15	And Huldah said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you
10080	11	22	16	22	16	that this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people, according to all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read,
10081	11	22	17	22	17	because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be kindled against this place and will not be quenched.’
10082	11	22	18	22	18	But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard,
10083	11	22	19	22	19	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its people, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the LORD.
10084	11	22	20	22	20	‘Therefore I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place.’” So they brought her answer back to the king.
10085	11	23	1	23	1	Then the king summoned all the elders of Jerusalem and Judah.
10086	11	23	2	23	2	And he went up to the house of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the prophets—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
10087	11	23	3	23	3	So the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant.
10088	11	23	4	23	4	Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests second in rank, and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal, Asherah, and all the host of heaven. And he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel.
10089	11	23	5	23	5	Josiah also did away with the idolatrous priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem—those who had burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.
10090	11	23	6	23	6	He brought the Asherah pole from the house of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, and there he burned it, ground it to powder, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.
10091	11	23	7	23	7	He also tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes that were in the house of the LORD, where the women had woven tapestries for Asherah.
10092	11	23	8	23	8	Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.
10093	11	23	9	23	9	Although the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
10094	11	23	10	23	10	He also desecrated Topheth in the Valley of Ben-hinnom so that no one could sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.
10095	11	23	11	23	11	And he removed from the entrance to the house of the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the chamber of an official named Nathan-melech. And Josiah burned up the chariots of the sun.
10096	11	23	12	23	12	He pulled down the altars that the kings of Judah had set up on the roof near the upper chamber of Ahaz, and the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD. The king pulverized them there and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley.
10097	11	23	13	23	13	The king also desecrated the high places east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
10098	11	23	14	23	14	He smashed the sacred pillars to pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and covered the sites with human bones.
10099	11	23	15	23	15	He even pulled down the altar at Bethel, the high place set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. Then he burned the high place, ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole.
10100	11	23	16	23	16	And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the hillside, and he sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs, and he burned them on the altar to defile it, according to the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who had foretold these things.
10101	11	23	17	23	17	Then the king asked, “What is this monument I see?” And the men of the city replied, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced these things that you have done to the altar of Bethel.”
10102	11	23	18	23	18	“Let him rest,” said Josiah. “Do not let anyone disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, along with those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
10103	11	23	19	23	19	Just as Josiah had done at Bethel, so also in the cities of Samaria he removed all the shrines of the high places set up by the kings of Israel who had provoked the LORD to anger.
10104	11	23	20	23	20	On the altars he slaughtered all the priests of the high places, and he burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
10105	11	23	21	23	21	The king commanded all the people, “Keep the Passover of the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”
10106	11	23	22	23	22	No such Passover had been observed from the days of the judges who had governed Israel through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah.
10107	11	23	23	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem.
10108	11	23	24	23	24	Furthermore, Josiah removed the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to carry out the words of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD.
10109	11	23	25	23	25	Neither before nor after Josiah was there any king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses.
10110	11	23	26	23	26	Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the fury of His burning anger, which was kindled against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke Him to anger.
10111	11	23	27	23	27	For the LORD had said, “I will also remove Judah from My sight, just as I have removed Israel. I will reject this city Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the temple of which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’”
10112	11	23	28	23	28	As for the rest of the acts of Josiah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
10113	11	23	29	23	29	At the end of Josiah’s reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt marched up to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to confront him, but Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo.
10114	11	23	30	23	30	From Megiddo his servants carried his body in a chariot, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
10115	11	23	31	23	31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
10116	11	23	32	23	32	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.
10117	11	23	33	23	33	And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned Jehoahaz at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he could not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
10118	11	23	34	23	34	Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, where he died.
10119	11	23	35	23	35	So Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold to Pharaoh Neco, but to meet Pharaoh’s demand he taxed the land and exacted the silver and the gold from the people, each according to his wealth.
10120	11	23	36	23	36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
10121	11	23	37	23	37	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.
10122	11	24	1	24	1	During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded. So Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years, until he turned and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
10123	11	24	2	24	2	And the LORD sent Chaldean, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Jehoiakim in order to destroy Judah, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servants the prophets.
10124	11	24	3	24	3	Surely this happened to Judah at the LORD’s command, to remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done,
10125	11	24	4	24	4	and also for the innocent blood he had shed. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was unwilling to forgive.
10126	11	24	5	24	5	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
10127	11	24	6	24	6	And Jehoiakim rested with his fathers, and his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.
10128	11	24	7	24	7	Now the king of Egypt did not march out of his land again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
10129	11	24	8	24	8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
10130	11	24	9	24	9	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father had done.
10131	11	24	10	24	10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege.
10132	11	24	11	24	11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it.
10133	11	24	12	24	12	Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials all surrendered to the king of Babylon. So in the eighth year of Jehoiachin’s reign, the king of Babylon took him captive.
10134	11	24	13	24	13	As the LORD had declared, Nebuchadnezzar also carried off all the treasures from the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he cut into pieces all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD.
10135	11	24	14	24	14	He carried into exile all Jerusalem—all the commanders and mighty men of valor, all the craftsmen and metalsmiths—ten thousand captives in all. Only the poorest people of the land remained.
10136	11	24	15	24	15	Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, as well as the king’s mother, his wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
10137	11	24	16	24	16	The king of Babylon also brought into exile to Babylon all seven thousand men of valor and a thousand craftsmen and metalsmiths—all strong and fit for battle.
10138	11	24	17	24	17	Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
10139	11	24	18	24	18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
10140	11	24	19	24	19	And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
10141	11	24	20	24	20	For because of the anger of the LORD, all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He finally banished them from His presence. And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
10142	11	25	1	25	1	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped outside the city and built a siege wall all around it.
10143	11	25	2	25	2	And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
10144	11	25	3	25	3	By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food.
10145	11	25	4	25	4	Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. They headed toward the Arabah,
10146	11	25	5	25	5	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him.
10147	11	25	6	25	6	The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment on him.
10148	11	25	7	25	7	And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
10149	11	25	8	25	8	On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
10150	11	25	9	25	9	He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building.
10151	11	25	10	25	10	And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
10152	11	25	11	25	11	Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the population.
10153	11	25	12	25	12	But the captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
10154	11	25	13	25	13	Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
10155	11	25	14	25	14	They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service.
10156	11	25	15	25	15	The captain of the guard also took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—anything made of pure gold or fine silver.
10157	11	25	16	25	16	As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.
10158	11	25	17	25	17	Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall. The bronze capital atop one pillar was three cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its network, was similar.
10159	11	25	18	25	18	The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
10160	11	25	19	25	19	Of those still in the city, he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as five royal advisors. He also took the scribe of the captain of the army, who enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were found in the city.
10161	11	25	20	25	20	Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
10162	11	25	21	25	21	There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land.
10163	11	25	22	25	22	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over the people he had left behind in the land of Judah.
10164	11	25	23	25	23	When all the commanders of the armies and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, as well as their men.
10165	11	25	24	25	24	And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”
10166	11	25	25	25	25	In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down and killed Gedaliah, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
10167	11	25	26	25	26	Then all the people small and great, together with the commanders of the army, arose and fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans.
10168	11	25	27	25	27	On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison.
10169	11	25	28	25	28	And he spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and set his throne over the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
10170	11	25	29	25	29	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and for the rest of his life he dined regularly before the king.
10171	11	25	30	25	30	And the king provided Jehoiachin a daily portion for the rest of his life.
10172	12	1	1	1	1	This is the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
10173	12	1	2	1	2	Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD has spoken: “I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against Me.
10174	12	1	3	1	3	The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s manger, but Israel does not know; My people do not understand.”
10175	12	1	4	1	4	Alas, O sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a brood of evildoers, children of depravity! They have forsaken the LORD; they have despised the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on Him.
10176	12	1	5	1	5	Why do you want more beatings? Why do you keep rebelling? Your head has a massive wound, and your whole heart is afflicted.
10177	12	1	6	1	6	From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, there is no soundness—only wounds and welts and festering sores neither cleansed nor bandaged nor soothed with oil.
10178	12	1	7	1	7	Your land is desolate; your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners devour your fields before you—a desolation demolished by strangers.
10179	12	1	8	1	8	And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned like a shelter in a vineyard, like a shack in a cucumber field, like a city besieged.
10180	12	1	9	1	9	Unless the LORD of Hosts had left us a few survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.
10181	12	1	10	1	10	Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
10182	12	1	11	1	11	“What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?” says the LORD. “I am full from the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; I take no delight in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
10183	12	1	12	1	12	When you come to appear before Me, who has required this of you—this trampling of My courts?
10184	12	1	13	1	13	Bring your worthless offerings no more; your incense is detestable to Me—your New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations. I cannot endure iniquity in a solemn assembly.
10185	12	1	14	1	14	I hate your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.
10186	12	1	15	1	15	When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; even though you multiply your prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.
10187	12	1	16	1	16	Wash and cleanse yourselves. Remove your evil deeds from My sight. Stop doing evil!
10188	12	1	17	1	17	Learn to do right; seek justice and correct the oppressor. Defend the fatherless and plead the case of the widow.”
10189	12	1	18	1	18	“Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they are as red as crimson, they will become like wool.
10190	12	1	19	1	19	If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best of the land.
10191	12	1	20	1	20	But if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
10192	12	1	21	1	21	See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness resided within her, but now only murderers!
10193	12	1	22	1	22	Your silver has become dross; your fine wine is diluted with water.
10194	12	1	23	1	23	Your rulers are rebels, friends of thieves. They all love bribes and chasing after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, and the plea of the widow never comes before them.
10195	12	1	24	1	24	Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah, I will be relieved of My foes and avenge Myself on My enemies.
10196	12	1	25	1	25	I will turn My hand against you; I will thoroughly purge your dross; I will remove all your impurities.
10197	12	1	26	1	26	I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as at the beginning. After that you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”
10198	12	1	27	1	27	Zion will be redeemed with justice, her repentant ones with righteousness.
10199	12	1	28	1	28	But rebels and sinners will together be shattered, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
10200	12	1	29	1	29	Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be embarrassed by the gardens that you have chosen.
10201	12	1	30	1	30	For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered, like a garden without water.
10202	12	1	31	1	31	The strong man will become tinder and his work will be a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the flames.
10203	12	2	1	2	1	This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
10204	12	2	2	2	2	In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD will be established as the chief of the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
10205	12	2	3	2	3	And many peoples will come and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us His ways so that we may walk in His paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
10206	12	2	4	2	4	Then He will judge between the nations and arbitrate for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation, nor train anymore for war.
10207	12	2	5	2	5	Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
10208	12	2	6	2	6	For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled with influences from the east; they are soothsayers like the Philistines; they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
10209	12	2	7	2	7	Their land is full of silver and gold, with no limit to their treasures; their land is full of horses, with no limit to their chariots.
10210	12	2	8	2	8	Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
10211	12	2	9	2	9	So mankind is brought low, and man is humbled—do not forgive them!
10212	12	2	10	2	10	Go into the rocks and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD and the splendor of His majesty.
10213	12	2	11	2	11	The proud look of man will be humbled, and the loftiness of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
10214	12	2	12	2	12	For the Day of the LORD of Hosts will come against all the proud and lofty, against all that is exalted—it will be humbled—
10215	12	2	13	2	13	against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, against all the oaks of Bashan,
10216	12	2	14	2	14	against all the tall mountains, against all the high hills,
10217	12	2	15	2	15	against every high tower, against every fortified wall,
10218	12	2	16	2	16	against every ship of Tarshish, and against every stately vessel.
10219	12	2	17	2	17	So the pride of man will be brought low, and the loftiness of men will be humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
10220	12	2	18	2	18	and the idols will vanish completely.
10221	12	2	19	2	19	Men will flee to caves in the rocks and holes in the ground, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty, when He rises to shake the earth.
10222	12	2	20	2	20	In that day men will cast away their idols of silver and gold—the idols they made to worship—away to the moles and bats.
10223	12	2	21	2	21	They will flee to caverns in the rocks and crevices in the cliffs, away from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty, when He rises to shake the earth.
10224	12	2	22	2	22	Put no more trust in man, who has only the breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?
10225	12	3	1	3	1	For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of food and water,
10226	12	3	2	3	2	the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,
10227	12	3	3	3	3	the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.
10228	12	3	4	3	4	“I will make mere lads their leaders, and children will rule over them.”
10229	12	3	5	3	5	The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the young will rise up against the old, and the base against the honorable.
10230	12	3	6	3	6	A man will seize his brother within his father’s house: “You have a cloak—you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of rubble.”
10231	12	3	7	3	7	On that day he will cry aloud: “I am not a healer. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me leader of the people!”
10232	12	3	8	3	8	For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they spoke and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence.
10233	12	3	9	3	9	The expression on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; they do not conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought disaster upon themselves.
10234	12	3	10	3	10	Tell the righteous it will be well for them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.
10235	12	3	11	3	11	Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done.
10236	12	3	12	3	12	Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. O My people, your guides mislead you; they turn you from your paths.
10237	12	3	13	3	13	The LORD arises to contend; He stands to judge the people.
10238	12	3	14	3	14	The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people: “You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
10239	12	3	15	3	15	Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
10240	12	3	16	3	16	The LORD also says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—walking with heads held high and wanton eyes, prancing and skipping as they go, jingling the bracelets on their ankles—
10241	12	3	17	3	17	the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.”
10242	12	3	18	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents;
10243	12	3	19	3	19	their pendants, bracelets, and veils;
10244	12	3	20	3	20	their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms;
10245	12	3	21	3	21	their signet rings and nose rings;
10246	12	3	22	3	22	their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;
10247	12	3	23	3	23	and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
10248	12	3	24	3	24	Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.
10249	12	3	25	3	25	Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.
10250	12	3	26	3	26	And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
10251	12	4	1	4	1	In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothes. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!”
10252	12	4	2	4	2	On that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.
10253	12	4	3	4	3	Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy—all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
10254	12	4	4	4	4	when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
10255	12	4	5	4	5	Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night. For over all the glory there will be a canopy,
10256	12	4	6	4	6	a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and the rain.
10257	12	5	1	5	1	I will sing for my beloved a song of his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
10258	12	5	2	5	2	He dug it up and cleared the stones and planted the finest vines. He built a watchtower in the middle and dug out a winepress as well. He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes, but the fruit it produced was sour!
10259	12	5	3	5	3	“And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem and men of Judah, I exhort you to judge between Me and My vineyard.
10260	12	5	4	5	4	What more could I have done for My vineyard than I already did for it? Why, when I expected sweet grapes, did it bring forth sour fruit?
10261	12	5	5	5	5	Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will tear down its wall, and it will be trampled.
10262	12	5	6	5	6	I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and thorns and briers will grow up. I will command the clouds that rain shall not fall on it.”
10263	12	5	7	5	7	For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of His delight. He looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard a cry of distress.
10264	12	5	8	5	8	Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field until no place is left and you live alone in the land.
10265	12	5	9	5	9	I heard the LORD of Hosts declare: “Surely many houses will become desolate, great mansions left unoccupied.
10266	12	5	10	5	10	For ten acres of vineyard will yield but a bath of wine, and a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.”
10267	12	5	11	5	11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning in pursuit of strong drink, who linger into the evening, to be inflamed by wine.
10268	12	5	12	5	12	At their feasts are the lyre and harp, tambourines and flutes and wine. They disregard the actions of the LORD and fail to see the work of His hands.
10269	12	5	13	5	13	Therefore My people will go into exile for their lack of understanding; their dignitaries are starving and their masses are parched with thirst.
10270	12	5	14	5	14	Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat and opens wide its enormous jaws, and down go Zion’s nobles and masses, her revelers and carousers!
10271	12	5	15	5	15	So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled; the arrogant will lower their eyes.
10272	12	5	16	5	16	But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice, and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
10273	12	5	17	5	17	Lambs will graze as in their own pastures, and strangers will feed in the ruins of the wealthy.
10274	12	5	18	5	18	Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit and pull sin along with cart ropes,
10275	12	5	19	5	19	to those who say, “Let Him hurry and hasten His work so that we may see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come so that we may know it!”
10276	12	5	20	5	20	Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who turn darkness to light and light to darkness, who replace bitter with sweet and sweet with bitter.
10277	12	5	21	5	21	Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
10278	12	5	22	5	22	Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine and champions in mixing beer,
10279	12	5	23	5	23	who acquit the guilty for a bribe and deprive the innocent of justice.
10280	12	5	24	5	24	Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw, and as dry grass shrivels in the flame, so their roots will decay and their blossoms will blow away like dust; for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
10281	12	5	25	5	25	Therefore the LORD’s anger burns against His people; He has raised His hand against them and struck them. The mountains quaked, and their corpses lay like refuse in the streets. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
10282	12	5	26	5	26	He lifts a banner for the distant nations and whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Behold—how speedily and swiftly they come!
10283	12	5	27	5	27	None of them grows weary or stumbles; no one slumbers or sleeps. No belt is loose and no sandal strap is broken.
10284	12	5	28	5	28	Their arrows are sharpened, and all their bows are strung. The hooves of their horses are like flint; their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind.
10285	12	5	29	5	29	Their roaring is like that of a lion; they roar like young lions. They growl and seize their prey; they carry it away from deliverance.
10286	12	5	30	5	30	In that day they will roar over it, like the roaring of the sea. If one looks over the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be obscured by clouds.
10287	12	6	1	6	1	In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe filled the temple.
10288	12	6	2	6	2	Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
10289	12	6	3	6	3	And they were calling out to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory.”
10290	12	6	4	6	4	At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.
10291	12	6	5	6	5	Then I said: “Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts.”
10292	12	6	6	6	6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
10293	12	6	7	6	7	And with it he touched my mouth and said: “Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for.”
10294	12	6	8	6	8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: “Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?” And I said: “Here am I. Send me!”
10295	12	6	9	6	9	And He replied: “Go and tell this people, ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’
10296	12	6	10	6	10	Make the hearts of this people calloused; deafen their ears and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”
10297	12	6	11	6	11	Then I asked: “How long, O Lord?” And He replied: “Until cities lie in ruins without an inhabitant, until the houses are left unoccupied, and the land is desolate and ravaged,
10298	12	6	12	6	12	until the LORD has driven men far away, and the land is utterly forsaken.
10299	12	6	13	6	13	And though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”
10300	12	7	1	7	1	Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram marched up to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city.
10301	12	7	2	7	2	When it was reported to the house of David that Aram was in league with Ephraim, the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.
10302	12	7	3	7	3	Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
10303	12	7	4	7	4	and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or fainthearted over these two smoldering stubs of firewood, over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
10304	12	7	5	7	5	For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin, saying:
10305	12	7	6	7	6	‘Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it among ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’
10306	12	7	7	7	7	But this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘It will not arise; it will not happen.
10307	12	7	8	7	8	For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered as a people.
10308	12	7	9	7	9	The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not stand firm in your faith, then you will not stand at all.’”
10309	12	7	10	7	10	Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,
10310	12	7	11	7	11	“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God, whether from the depths of Sheol or the heights of heaven.”
10311	12	7	12	7	12	But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask; I will not test the LORD.”
10312	12	7	13	7	13	Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God as well?
10313	12	7	14	7	14	Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and she will call Him Immanuel.
10314	12	7	15	7	15	By the time He knows enough to reject evil and choose good, He will be eating curds and honey.
10315	12	7	16	7	16	For before the boy knows enough to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
10316	12	7	17	7	17	The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—He will bring the king of Assyria.”
10317	12	7	18	7	18	On that day the LORD will whistle to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bees in the land of Assyria.
10318	12	7	19	7	19	And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and clefts of the rocks, in all the thornbushes and watering holes.
10319	12	7	20	7	20	On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates—the king of Assyria—to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to remove your beard as well.
10320	12	7	21	7	21	On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
10321	12	7	22	7	22	and from the abundance of milk they give, he will eat curds; for all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
10322	12	7	23	7	23	And on that day, in every place that had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver, only briers and thorns will be found.
10323	12	7	24	7	24	Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
10324	12	7	25	7	25	For fear of the briers and thorns, you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe; they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample.
10325	12	8	1	8	1	Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary stylus: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
10326	12	8	2	8	2	And I will appoint for Myself trustworthy witnesses—Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
10327	12	8	3	8	3	And I had relations with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
10328	12	8	4	8	4	For before the boy knows how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
10329	12	8	5	8	5	And the LORD spoke to me further:
10330	12	8	6	8	6	“Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
10331	12	8	7	8	7	the Lord will surely bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—the king of Assyria and all his pomp. It will overflow its channels and overrun its banks.
10332	12	8	8	8	8	It will pour into Judah, swirling and sweeping over it, reaching up to the neck; its spreading streams will cover your entire land, O Immanuel!
10333	12	8	9	8	9	Huddle together, O peoples, and be shattered; pay attention, all you distant lands; prepare for battle, and be shattered; prepare for battle, and be shattered!
10334	12	8	10	8	10	Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; state a proposal, but it will not happen. For God is with us.”
10335	12	8	11	8	11	For this is what the LORD has spoken to me with a strong hand, instructing me not to walk in the way of this people:
10336	12	8	12	8	12	“Do not call conspiracy everything these people regard as conspiracy. Do not fear what they fear; do not live in dread.
10337	12	8	13	8	13	The LORD of Hosts is the One you shall regard as holy. Only He should be feared; only He should be dreaded.
10338	12	8	14	8	14	And He will be a sanctuary—but to both houses of Israel a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, to the dwellers of Jerusalem a trap and a snare.
10339	12	8	15	8	15	Many will stumble over these; they will fall and be broken; they will be ensnared and captured.”
10340	12	8	16	8	16	Bind up the testimony and seal the law among my disciples.
10341	12	8	17	8	17	I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in Him.
10342	12	8	18	8	18	Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me as signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
10343	12	8	19	8	19	When men tell you to consult the spirits of the dead and the spiritists who whisper and mutter, shouldn’t a people consult their God instead? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
10344	12	8	20	8	20	To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
10345	12	8	21	8	21	They will roam the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged; and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God.
10346	12	8	22	8	22	Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into utter darkness.
10347	12	8	23	9	1	Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will honor the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
10348	12	9	1	9	2	The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
10349	12	9	2	9	3	You have enlarged the nation and increased its joy. The people rejoice before You as they rejoice at harvest time, as men rejoice in dividing the plunder.
10350	12	9	3	9	4	For as in the day of Midian You have shattered the yoke of their burden, the bar across their shoulders, and the rod of their oppressor.
10351	12	9	4	9	5	For every trampling boot of battle and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.
10352	12	9	5	9	6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulders. And He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
10353	12	9	6	9	7	Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness from that time and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
10354	12	9	7	9	8	The Lord has sent a message against Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.
10355	12	9	8	9	9	All the people will know it—Ephraim and the dwellers of Samaria. With pride and arrogance of heart they will say:
10356	12	9	9	9	10	“The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with finished stone; the sycamores have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.”
10357	12	9	10	9	11	The LORD has raised up the foes of Rezin against him and joined his enemies together.
10358	12	9	11	9	12	Aram from the east and Philistia from the west have devoured Israel with open mouths. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
10359	12	9	12	9	13	But the people did not return to Him who struck them; they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.
10360	12	9	13	9	14	So the LORD will cut off Israel’s head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day.
10361	12	9	14	9	15	The head is the elder and honorable man, and the tail is the prophet who teaches lies.
10362	12	9	15	9	16	For those who guide this people mislead them, and those they mislead are swallowed up.
10363	12	9	16	9	17	Therefore the Lord takes no pleasure in their young men; He has no compassion on their fatherless and widows. For every one of them is godless and wicked, and every mouth speaks folly. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
10364	12	9	17	9	18	For wickedness burns like a fire that consumes the thorns and briers and kindles the forest thickets which roll upward in billows of smoke.
10365	12	9	18	9	19	By the wrath of the LORD of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people are fuel for the fire. No man even spares his brother.
10366	12	9	19	9	20	They carve out what is on the right, but they are still hungry; they eat what is on the left, but they are still not satisfied. Each one devours the flesh of his own offspring.
10367	12	9	20	9	21	Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; together they turn against Judah. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
10368	12	10	1	10	1	Woe to those who enact unjust statutes and issue oppressive decrees,
10369	12	10	2	10	2	to deprive the poor of fair treatment and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people, to make widows their prey and orphans their plunder.
10370	12	10	3	10	3	What will you do on the day of reckoning when devastation comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
10371	12	10	4	10	4	Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives or fall among the slain. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.
10372	12	10	5	10	5	Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger; the staff in their hands is My wrath.
10373	12	10	6	10	6	I will send him against a godless nation; I will dispatch him against a people destined for My rage, to take spoils and seize plunder, and to trample them down like clay in the streets.
10374	12	10	7	10	7	But this is not his intention; this is not his plan. For it is in his heart to destroy and cut off many nations.
10375	12	10	8	10	8	“Are not all my commanders kings?” he says.
10376	12	10	9	10	9	“Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
10377	12	10	10	10	10	As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms whose images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
10378	12	10	11	10	11	and as I have done to Samaria and its idols, will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols?”
10379	12	10	12	10	12	So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes.
10380	12	10	13	10	13	For he says: ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, for I am clever. I have removed the boundaries of nations and plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their rulers.
10381	12	10	14	10	14	My hand reached as into a nest to seize the wealth of the nations. Like one gathering abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth. No wing fluttered, no beak opened or chirped.’”
10382	12	10	15	10	15	Does an axe raise itself above the one who swings it? Does a saw boast over him who saws with it? It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it, or a staff lifting him who is not wood!
10383	12	10	16	10	16	Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease among Assyria’s stout warriors, and under his pomp will be kindled a fire like a burning flame.
10384	12	10	17	10	17	And the Light of Israel will become a fire, and its Holy One a flame. In a single day it will burn and devour Assyria’s thorns and thistles.
10385	12	10	18	10	18	The splendor of its forests and orchards, both soul and body, it will completely destroy, as a sickness consumes a man.
10386	12	10	19	10	19	The remaining trees of its forests will be so few that a child could count them.
10387	12	10	20	10	20	On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on him who struck them, but they will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
10388	12	10	21	10	21	A remnant will return—a remnant of Jacob—to the Mighty God.
10389	12	10	22	10	22	Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
10390	12	10	23	10	23	For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
10391	12	10	24	10	24	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strikes you with a rod and lifts his staff against you as the Egyptians did.
10392	12	10	25	10	25	For in just a little while My fury against you will subside, and My anger will turn to their destruction.”
10393	12	10	26	10	26	And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them, as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise His staff over the sea, as He did in Egypt.
10394	12	10	27	10	27	On that day the burden will be lifted from your shoulders, and the yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because your neck will be too large.
10395	12	10	28	10	28	Assyria has entered Aiath and passed through Migron, storing their supplies at Michmash.
10396	12	10	29	10	29	They have crossed at the ford: “We will spend the night at Geba.” Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
10397	12	10	30	10	30	Cry aloud, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! O wretched Anathoth!
10398	12	10	31	10	31	Madmenah flees; the people of Gebim take refuge.
10399	12	10	32	10	32	Yet today they will halt at Nob, shaking a fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
10400	12	10	33	10	33	Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off the branches with terrifying power. The tall trees will be cut down, the lofty ones will be felled.
10401	12	10	34	10	34	He will clear the forest thickets with an axe, and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
10402	12	11	1	11	1	Then a shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit.
10403	12	11	2	11	2	The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the LORD.
10404	12	11	3	11	3	And He will delight in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what His eyes see, and He will not decide by what His ears hear,
10405	12	11	4	11	4	but with righteousness He will judge the poor, and with equity He will decide for the lowly of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth and slay the wicked with the breath of His lips.
10406	12	11	5	11	5	Righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the sash around His waist.
10407	12	11	6	11	6	The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the goat; the calf and young lion and fatling will be together, and a little child will lead them.
10408	12	11	7	11	7	The cow will graze with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
10409	12	11	8	11	8	The infant will play by the cobra’s den, and the toddler will reach into the viper’s nest.
10410	12	11	9	11	9	They will neither harm nor destroy on all My holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the sea is full of water.
10411	12	11	10	11	10	On that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek Him, and His place of rest will be glorious.
10412	12	11	11	11	11	On that day the Lord will extend His hand a second time to recover the remnant of His people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
10413	12	11	12	11	12	He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; He will collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
10414	12	11	13	11	13	Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, and the adversaries of Judah will be cut off. Ephraim will no longer envy Judah, nor will Judah harass Ephraim.
10415	12	11	14	11	14	They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines to the west; together they will plunder the sons of the east. They will lay their hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
10416	12	11	15	11	15	The LORD will devote to destruction the gulf of the Sea of Egypt; with a scorching wind He will sweep His hand over the Euphrates. He will split it into seven streams for men to cross with dry sandals.
10417	12	11	16	11	16	There will be a highway for the remnant of His people who remain from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
10418	12	12	1	12	1	In that day you will say: “O LORD, I will praise You. Although You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.
10419	12	12	2	12	2	Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation.”
10420	12	12	3	12	3	With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,
10421	12	12	4	12	4	and on that day you will say: “Give praise to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted.
10422	12	12	5	12	5	Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth.
10423	12	12	6	12	6	Cry out and sing, O citizen of Zion, for great among you is the Holy One of Israel.”
10424	12	13	1	13	1	This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received:
10425	12	13	2	13	2	Raise a banner on a barren hilltop; call aloud to them. Wave your hand, that they may enter the gates of the nobles.
10426	12	13	3	13	3	I have commanded My sanctified ones; I have even summoned My warriors to execute My wrath and exult in My triumph.
10427	12	13	4	13	4	Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations gathered together! The LORD of Hosts musters an army for war.
10428	12	13	5	13	5	They are coming from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens—the LORD and the weapons of His wrath—to destroy the whole country.
10429	12	13	6	13	6	Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near; it will come as destruction from the Almighty.
10430	12	13	7	13	7	Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt.
10431	12	13	8	13	8	Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear.
10432	12	13	9	13	9	Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming—cruel, with fury and burning anger—to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners within it.
10433	12	13	10	13	10	For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.
10434	12	13	11	13	11	I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant and lay low the pride of the ruthless.
10435	12	13	12	13	12	I will make man scarcer than pure gold, and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir.
10436	12	13	13	13	13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts on the day of His burning anger.
10437	12	13	14	13	14	Like a hunted gazelle, like a sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.
10438	12	13	15	13	15	Whoever is caught will be stabbed, and whoever is captured will die by the sword.
10439	12	13	16	13	16	Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be ravished.
10440	12	13	17	13	17	Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who have no regard for silver and no desire for gold.
10441	12	13	18	13	18	Their bows will dash young men to pieces; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; they will not look with pity on the children.
10442	12	13	19	13	19	And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
10443	12	13	20	13	20	She will never be inhabited or settled from generation to generation; no nomad will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flock there.
10444	12	13	21	13	21	But desert creatures will lie down there, and howling creatures will fill her houses. The owls will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.
10445	12	13	22	13	22	Hyenas will howl in her fortresses and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.
10446	12	14	1	14	1	For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will choose Israel once again. He will settle them on their own land. The foreigner will join them and be united with the house of Jacob.
10447	12	14	2	14	2	The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. Then the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
10448	12	14	3	14	3	On the day that the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor into which you were forced,
10449	12	14	4	14	4	you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has ceased, and how his fury has ended!
10450	12	14	5	14	5	The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers.
10451	12	14	6	14	6	It struck the peoples in anger with unceasing blows; it subdued the nations in rage with relentless persecution.
10452	12	14	7	14	7	All the earth is at peace and at rest; they break out in song.
10453	12	14	8	14	8	Even the cypresses and cedars of Lebanon exult over you: “Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes against us.”
10454	12	14	9	14	9	Sheol beneath is eager to meet you upon your arrival. It stirs the spirits of the dead to greet you—all the rulers of the earth. It makes all the kings of the nations rise from their thrones.
10455	12	14	10	14	10	They will all respond to you, saying, “You too have become weak, as we are; you have become like us!”
10456	12	14	11	14	11	Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol, along with the music of your harps. Maggots are your bed and worms your blanket.
10457	12	14	12	14	12	How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the ground, O destroyer of nations.
10458	12	14	13	14	13	You said in your heart: “I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God. I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the far reaches of the north.
10459	12	14	14	14	14	I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.”
10460	12	14	15	14	15	But you will be brought down to Sheol, to the lowest depths of the Pit.
10461	12	14	16	14	16	Those who see you will stare; they will ponder your fate: “Is this the man who shook the earth and made the kingdoms tremble,
10462	12	14	17	14	17	who turned the world into a desert and destroyed its cities, who refused to let the captives return to their homes?”
10463	12	14	18	14	18	All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
10464	12	14	19	14	19	But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch, covered by those slain with the sword, and dumped into a rocky pit like a carcass trampled underfoot.
10465	12	14	20	14	20	You will not join them in burial, since you have destroyed your land and slaughtered your own people. The offspring of the wicked will never again be mentioned.
10466	12	14	21	14	21	Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the iniquities of their forefathers. They will never rise up to possess a land or cover the earth with their cities.
10467	12	14	22	14	22	“I will rise up against them,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will cut off from Babylon her name and her remnant, her offspring and her posterity,” declares the LORD.
10468	12	14	23	14	23	“I will make her a place for owls and for swamplands; I will sweep her away with the broom of destruction,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
10469	12	14	24	14	24	The LORD of Hosts has sworn: “Surely, as I have planned, so will it be; as I have purposed, so will it stand.
10470	12	14	25	14	25	I will break Assyria in My land; I will trample him on My mountain. His yoke will be taken off My people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.”
10471	12	14	26	14	26	This is the plan devised for the whole earth, and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations.
10472	12	14	27	14	27	The LORD of Hosts has purposed, and who can thwart Him? His hand is outstretched, so who can turn it back?
10473	12	14	28	14	28	In the year that King Ahaz died, this burden was received:
10474	12	14	29	14	29	Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken. For a viper will spring from the root of the snake, and a flying serpent from its egg.
10475	12	14	30	14	30	Then the firstborn of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety, but I will kill your root by famine, and your remnant will be slain.
10476	12	14	31	14	31	Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! For a cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there are no stragglers in its ranks.
10477	12	14	32	14	32	What answer will be given to the envoys of that nation? “The LORD has founded Zion, where His afflicted people will find refuge.”
10478	12	15	1	15	1	This is the burden against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!
10479	12	15	2	15	2	Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.
10480	12	15	3	15	3	In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.
10481	12	15	4	15	4	Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.
10482	12	15	5	15	5	My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah; with weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.
10483	12	15	6	15	6	The waters of Nimrim are dried up, and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone, and the greenery is no more.
10484	12	15	7	15	7	So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.
10485	12	15	8	15	8	For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.
10486	12	15	9	15	9	The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimon—a lion on the fugitives of Moab, and on the remnant of the land.
10487	12	16	1	16	1	Send the tribute lambs to the ruler of the land, from Sela in the desert to the mount of Daughter Zion.
10488	12	16	2	16	2	Like fluttering birds pushed out of the nest, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon:
10489	12	16	3	16	3	“Give us counsel; render a decision. Shelter us at noonday with shade as dark as night. Hide the refugees; do not betray the one who flees.
10490	12	16	4	16	4	Let my fugitives stay with you; be a refuge for Moab from the destroyer.” When the oppressor has gone, destruction has ceased, and the oppressors have vanished from the land,
10491	12	16	5	16	5	in loving devotion a throne will be established in the tent of David. A judge seeking justice and hastening righteousness will sit on it in faithfulness.
10492	12	16	6	16	6	We have heard of Moab’s pride, his exceeding pride and conceit, his overflowing arrogance. But his boasting is empty.
10493	12	16	7	16	7	Therefore let Moab wail; let them wail together for Moab. Mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth, you who are utterly stricken.
10494	12	16	8	16	8	For the fields of Heshbon have withered, along with the grapevines of Sibmah. The rulers of the nations have trampled its choicest vines, which had reached as far as Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots had spread out and passed over the sea.
10495	12	16	9	16	9	So I weep with Jazer for the vines of Sibmah; I drench Heshbon and Elealeh with my tears. Triumphant shouts have fallen silent over your summer fruit and your harvest.
10496	12	16	10	16	10	Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards. No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses; I have put an end to the cheering.
10497	12	16	11	16	11	Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir-heres.
10498	12	16	12	16	12	When Moab appears on the high place, when he wearies himself and enters his sanctuary to pray, it will do him no good.
10499	12	16	13	16	13	This is the message that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
10500	12	16	14	16	14	And now the LORD says, “In three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab’s splendor will become an object of contempt, with all her many people. And those who are left will be few and feeble.”
10501	12	17	1	17	1	This is the burden against Damascus: “Behold, Damascus is no longer a city; it has become a heap of ruins.
10502	12	17	2	17	2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they will be left to the flocks, which will lie down with no one to fear.
10503	12	17	3	17	3	The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the sovereignty from Damascus. The remnant of Aram will be like the splendor of the Israelites,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
10504	12	17	4	17	4	“In that day the splendor of Jacob will fade, and the fat of his body will waste away,
10505	12	17	5	17	5	as the reaper gathers the standing grain and harvests the ears with his arm, as one gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
10506	12	17	6	17	6	Yet gleanings will remain, like an olive tree that has been beaten—two or three berries atop the tree, four or five on its fruitful branches,” declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
10507	12	17	7	17	7	In that day men will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
10508	12	17	8	17	8	They will not look to the altars they have fashioned with their hands or to the Asherahs and incense altars they have made with their fingers.
10509	12	17	9	17	9	In that day their strong cities will be like forsaken thickets and summits, abandoned to the Israelites and to utter desolation.
10510	12	17	10	17	10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation and failed to remember the Rock of your refuge. Therefore, though you cultivate delightful plots and set out cuttings from exotic vines—
10511	12	17	11	17	11	though on the day you plant you make them grow, and on that morning you help your seed sprout—yet the harvest will vanish on the day of disease and incurable pain.
10512	12	17	12	17	12	Alas, the tumult of many peoples; they rage like the roaring seas and clamoring nations; they rumble like the crashing of mighty waters.
10513	12	17	13	17	13	The nations rage like the rush of many waters. He rebukes them, and they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweeds before a gale.
10514	12	17	14	17	14	In the evening, there is sudden terror! Before morning, they are no more! This is the portion of those who loot us and the lot of those who plunder us.
10515	12	18	1	18	1	Woe to the land of whirring wings, along the rivers of Cush,
10516	12	18	2	18	2	which sends couriers by sea, in papyrus vessels on the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people widely feared, to a powerful nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.
10517	12	18	3	18	3	All you people of the world and dwellers of the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it; when a ram’s horn sounds, you will hear it.
10518	12	18	4	18	4	For this is what the LORD has told me: “I will quietly look on from My dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”
10519	12	18	5	18	5	For before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the shoots with a pruning knife and remove and discard the branches.
10520	12	18	6	18	6	They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey, and to the beasts of the land. The birds will feed on them in summer, and all the wild animals in winter.
10521	12	18	7	18	7	At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD of Hosts—from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people widely feared, from a powerful nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers—to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD of Hosts.
10522	12	19	1	19	1	This is the burden against Egypt: Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud; He is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble before Him, and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them.
10523	12	19	2	19	2	“So I will incite Egyptian against Egyptian; brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
10524	12	19	3	19	3	Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be emptied out from among them, and I will frustrate their plans, so that they will resort to idols and spirits of the dead, to mediums and spiritists.
10525	12	19	4	19	4	I will deliver the Egyptians into the hands of harsh masters, and a fierce king will rule over them,” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
10526	12	19	5	19	5	The waters of the Nile will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and empty.
10527	12	19	6	19	6	The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will trickle and dry up; the reeds and rushes will wither.
10528	12	19	7	19	7	The bulrushes by the Nile, by the mouth of the river, and all the fields sown along the Nile, will wither, blow away, and be no more.
10529	12	19	8	19	8	Then the fishermen will mourn, all who cast a hook into the Nile will lament, and those who spread nets on the waters will pine away.
10530	12	19	9	19	9	The workers in flax will be dismayed, and the weavers of fine linen will turn pale.
10531	12	19	10	19	10	The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the hired workers will be sick at heart.
10532	12	19	11	19	11	The princes of Zoan are mere fools; Pharaoh’s wise counselors give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am one of the wise, a son of eastern kings”?
10533	12	19	12	19	12	Where are your wise men now? Let them tell you and reveal what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.
10534	12	19	13	19	13	The princes of Zoan have become fools; the princes of Memphis are deceived. The cornerstones of her tribes have led Egypt astray.
10535	12	19	14	19	14	The LORD has poured into her a spirit of confusion. Egypt has been led astray in all she does, as a drunkard staggers through his own vomit.
10536	12	19	15	19	15	There is nothing Egypt can do—head or tail, palm or reed.
10537	12	19	16	19	16	In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble with fear beneath the uplifted hand of the LORD of Hosts, when He brandishes it against them.
10538	12	19	17	19	17	The land of Judah will bring terror to Egypt; whenever Judah is mentioned, Egypt will tremble over what the LORD of Hosts has planned against it.
10539	12	19	18	19	18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of Hosts. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.
10540	12	19	19	19	19	In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the center of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD near her border.
10541	12	19	20	19	20	It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of Hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, He will send them a savior and defender to rescue them.
10542	12	19	21	19	21	The LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and on that day Egypt will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and fulfill them.
10543	12	19	22	19	22	And the LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; He will strike them but heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and He will hear their prayers and heal them.
10544	12	19	23	19	23	In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
10545	12	19	24	19	24	In that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing upon the earth.
10546	12	19	25	19	25	The LORD of Hosts will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.”
10547	12	20	1	20	1	Before the year that the chief commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it,
10548	12	20	2	20	2	the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals from your feet.” And Isaiah did so, walking around naked and barefoot.
10549	12	20	3	20	3	Then the LORD said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and omen against Egypt and Cush,
10550	12	20	4	20	4	so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks—to Egypt’s shame.
10551	12	20	5	20	5	Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast will be dismayed and ashamed.
10552	12	20	6	20	6	And on that day the dwellers of this coastland will say, ‘See what has happened to our source of hope, those to whom we fled for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’”
10553	12	21	1	21	1	This is the burden against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the Negev, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
10554	12	21	2	21	2	A dire vision is declared to me: “The traitor still betrays, and the destroyer still destroys. Go up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! I will put an end to all her groaning.”
10555	12	21	3	21	3	Therefore my body is filled with anguish. Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am bewildered to hear, I am dismayed to see.
10556	12	21	4	21	4	My heart staggers; fear makes me tremble. The twilight of my desire has turned to horror.
10557	12	21	5	21	5	They prepare a table, they lay out a carpet, they eat, they drink! Rise up, O princes, oil the shields!
10558	12	21	6	21	6	For this is what the Lord says to me: “Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
10559	12	21	7	21	7	When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, he must be alert, fully alert.”
10560	12	21	8	21	8	Then the lookout shouted, “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; night after night I stay at my post.
10561	12	21	9	21	9	Look, here come the riders, horsemen in pairs.” And one answered, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
10562	12	21	10	21	10	O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.
10563	12	21	11	21	11	This is the burden against Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?”
10564	12	21	12	21	12	The watchman replies, “Morning has come, but also the night. If you would inquire, then inquire. Come back yet again.”
10565	12	21	13	21	13	This is the burden against Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia you must lodge, O caravans of Dedanites.
10566	12	21	14	21	14	Bring water for the thirsty, O dwellers of Tema; meet the refugees with food.
10567	12	21	15	21	15	For they flee from the sword, the sword that is drawn, from the bow that is bent, and from the stress of battle.
10568	12	21	16	21	16	For this is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone.
10569	12	21	17	21	17	The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
10570	12	22	1	22	1	This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the rooftops,
10571	12	22	2	22	2	O city of commotion, O town of revelry? Your slain did not die by the sword, nor were they killed in battle.
10572	12	22	3	22	3	All your rulers have fled together, captured without a bow. All your fugitives were captured together, having fled to a distant place.
10573	12	22	4	22	4	Therefore I said, “Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! Do not try to console me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
10574	12	22	5	22	5	For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—of breaking down the walls and crying to the mountains.
10575	12	22	6	22	6	Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovers the shield.
10576	12	22	7	22	7	Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the gates.
10577	12	22	8	22	8	He has uncovered the defenses of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
10578	12	22	9	22	9	You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool.
10579	12	22	10	22	10	You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall.
10580	12	22	11	22	11	You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago.
10581	12	22	12	22	12	On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts called for weeping and wailing, for shaven heads and the wearing of sackcloth.
10582	12	22	13	22	13	But look, there is joy and gladness, butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
10583	12	22	14	22	14	The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: “Until your dying day, this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” says the Lord GOD of Hosts.
10584	12	22	15	22	15	This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace:
10585	12	22	16	22	16	What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock?
10586	12	22	17	22	17	Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you,
10587	12	22	18	22	18	roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master.
10588	12	22	19	22	19	I will depose you from office, and you will be ousted from your position.
10589	12	22	20	22	20	On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
10590	12	22	21	22	21	I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
10591	12	22	22	22	22	I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
10592	12	22	23	22	23	I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.
10593	12	22	24	22	24	So they will hang on him the whole burden of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
10594	12	22	25	22	25	In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
10595	12	23	1	23	1	This is the burden against Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor. Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus.
10596	12	23	2	23	2	Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, whose traders have crossed the sea.
10597	12	23	3	23	3	On the great waters came the grain of Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; she was the merchant of the nations.
10598	12	23	4	23	4	Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken: “I have not been in labor or given birth. I have not raised young men or brought up young women.”
10599	12	23	5	23	5	When the report reaches Egypt, they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.
10600	12	23	6	23	6	Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!
10601	12	23	7	23	7	Is this your jubilant city, whose origin is from antiquity, whose feet have taken her to settle far away?
10602	12	23	8	23	8	Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose traders are princes, whose merchants are renowned on the earth?
10603	12	23	9	23	9	The LORD of Hosts planned it, to defile all its glorious beauty, to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.
10604	12	23	10	23	10	Cultivate your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer a harbor.
10605	12	23	11	23	11	The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; He has made kingdoms tremble. He has given a command that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.
10606	12	23	12	23	12	He said, “You shall rejoice no more, O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Get up and cross over to Cyprus—even there you will find no rest.”
10607	12	23	13	23	13	Look at the land of the Chaldeans—a people now of no account. The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They brought it to ruin.
10608	12	23	14	23	14	Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your harbor has been destroyed!
10609	12	23	15	23	15	At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
10610	12	23	16	23	16	“Take up your harp, stroll through the city, O forgotten harlot. Make sweet melody, sing many a song, so you will be remembered.”
10611	12	23	17	23	17	And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
10612	12	23	18	23	18	Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.
10613	12	24	1	24	1	Behold, the LORD lays waste the earth and leaves it in ruins. He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants—
10614	12	24	2	24	2	people and priest alike, servant and master, maid and mistress, buyer and seller, lender and borrower, creditor and debtor.
10615	12	24	3	24	3	The earth will be utterly laid waste and thoroughly plundered. The LORD has spoken this word.
10616	12	24	4	24	4	The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and fades; the exalted of the earth waste away.
10617	12	24	5	24	5	The earth is defiled by its people; they have transgressed the laws; they have overstepped the decrees and broken the everlasting covenant.
10618	12	24	6	24	6	Therefore a curse has consumed the earth, and its inhabitants must bear the guilt; the earth’s dwellers have been burned, and only a few survive.
10619	12	24	7	24	7	The new wine dries up, the vine withers. All the merrymakers now groan.
10620	12	24	8	24	8	The joyful tambourines have ceased; the noise of revelers has stopped; the joyful harp is silent.
10621	12	24	9	24	9	They no longer sing and drink wine; strong drink is bitter to those who consume it.
10622	12	24	10	24	10	The city of chaos is shattered; every house is closed to entry.
10623	12	24	11	24	11	In the streets they cry out for wine. All joy turns to gloom; rejoicing is exiled from the land.
10624	12	24	12	24	12	The city is left in ruins; its gate is reduced to rubble.
10625	12	24	13	24	13	So will it be on the earth and among the nations, like a harvested olive tree, like a gleaning after a grape harvest.
10626	12	24	14	24	14	They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they proclaim the majesty of the LORD.
10627	12	24	15	24	15	Therefore glorify the LORD in the east. Extol the name of the LORD, the God of Israel in the islands of the sea.
10628	12	24	16	24	16	From the ends of the earth we hear singing: “Glory to the Righteous One.” But I said, “I am wasting away! I am wasting away! Woe is me.” The treacherous betray; the treacherous deal in treachery.
10629	12	24	17	24	17	Terror and pit and snare await you, O dwellers of the earth.
10630	12	24	18	24	18	Whoever flees the sound of terror will fall into a pit, and whoever climbs from the pit will be caught in a trap. For the windows of heaven are open, and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
10631	12	24	19	24	19	The earth is utterly broken apart, the earth is split open, the earth is shaken violently.
10632	12	24	20	24	20	The earth staggers like a drunkard and sways like a shack. Earth’s rebellion weighs it down, and it falls, never to rise again.
10633	12	24	21	24	21	In that day the LORD will punish the host of heaven above and the kings of the earth below.
10634	12	24	22	24	22	They will be gathered together like prisoners in a pit. They will be confined to a dungeon and punished after many days.
10635	12	24	23	24	23	The moon will be confounded and the sun will be ashamed; for the LORD of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders with great glory.
10636	12	25	1	25	1	O LORD, You are my God! I will exalt You; I will praise Your name. For You have worked wonders—plans formed long ago—in perfect faithfulness.
10637	12	25	2	25	2	Indeed, You have turned the city into a heap of rubble, the fortified town into a ruin. The fortress of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
10638	12	25	3	25	3	Therefore, a strong people will honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
10639	12	25	4	25	4	For You have been a refuge for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,
10640	12	25	5	25	5	like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, so the song of the ruthless is silenced.
10641	12	25	6	25	6	On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.
10642	12	25	7	25	7	On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;
10643	12	25	8	25	8	He will swallow up death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth. For the LORD has spoken.
10644	12	25	9	25	9	And in that day it will be said, “Surely this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”
10645	12	25	10	25	10	For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trodden into the dung pile.
10646	12	25	11	25	11	He will spread out his hands within it, as a swimmer spreads his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, despite the skill of his hands.
10647	12	25	12	25	12	The high-walled fortress will be brought down, cast to the ground, into the dust.
10648	12	26	1	26	1	In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation is established as its walls and ramparts.
10649	12	26	2	26	2	Open the gates so a righteous nation may enter—one that remains faithful.
10650	12	26	3	26	3	You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, because he trusts in You.
10651	12	26	4	26	4	Trust in the LORD forever, because GOD the LORD is the Rock eternal.
10652	12	26	5	26	5	For He has humbled those who dwell on high; He lays the lofty city low. He brings it down to the ground; He casts it into the dust.
10653	12	26	6	26	6	Feet trample it down—the feet of the oppressed, the steps of the poor.
10654	12	26	7	26	7	The path of the righteous is level; You clear a straight path for the upright.
10655	12	26	8	26	8	Yes, we wait for You, O LORD; we walk in the path of Your judgments. Your name and renown are the desire of our souls.
10656	12	26	9	26	9	My soul longs for You in the night; indeed, my spirit seeks You at dawn. For when Your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.
10657	12	26	10	26	10	Though grace is shown to the wicked man, he does not learn righteousness. In the land of righteousness he acts unjustly and fails to see the majesty of the LORD.
10658	12	26	11	26	11	O LORD, Your hand is upraised, but they do not see it. They will see Your zeal for Your people and be put to shame. The fire set for Your enemies will consume them!
10659	12	26	12	26	12	O LORD, You will establish peace for us. For all that we have accomplished, You have done for us.
10660	12	26	13	26	13	O LORD our God, other lords besides You have had dominion, but Your name alone do we confess.
10661	12	26	14	26	14	The dead will not live; the departed spirits will not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them; You have wiped out all memory of them.
10662	12	26	15	26	15	You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; You have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for Yourself; You have extended all the borders of the land.
10663	12	26	16	26	16	O LORD, they sought You in their distress; when You disciplined them, they poured out a quiet prayer.
10664	12	26	17	26	17	As a woman with child about to give birth writhes and cries out in pain, so were we in Your presence, O LORD.
10665	12	26	18	26	18	We were with child; we writhed in pain; but we gave birth to wind. We have given no salvation to the earth, nor brought any life into the world.
10666	12	26	19	26	19	Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust! For your dew is like the dew of the morning, and the earth will bring forth her dead.
10667	12	26	20	26	20	Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourselves a little while until the wrath has passed.
10668	12	26	21	26	21	For behold, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth will reveal her bloodshed and will no longer conceal her slain.
10669	12	27	1	27	1	In that day the LORD will take His sharp, great, and mighty sword, and bring judgment on Leviathan, the fleeing serpent—Leviathan, the coiling serpent—and He will slay the dragon of the sea.
10670	12	27	2	27	2	In that day: “Sing about a fruitful vineyard.
10671	12	27	3	27	3	I, the LORD, am its keeper; I water it continually. I guard it night and day so no one can disturb it;
10672	12	27	4	27	4	I am not angry. If only thorns and briers confronted Me, I would march and trample them, I would burn them to the ground.
10673	12	27	5	27	5	Or let them lay claim to My protection; let them make peace with Me—yes, let them make peace with Me.”
10674	12	27	6	27	6	In the days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will bud and blossom and fill the whole world with fruit.
10675	12	27	7	27	7	Has the LORD struck Israel as He struck her oppressors? Was she killed like those who slayed her?
10676	12	27	8	27	8	By warfare and exile You contended with her and removed her with a fierce wind, as on the day the east wind blows.
10677	12	27	9	27	9	Therefore Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for, and the full fruit of the removal of his sin will be this: When he makes all the altar stones like crushed bits of chalk, no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.
10678	12	27	10	27	10	For the fortified city lies deserted—a homestead abandoned, a wilderness forsaken. There the calves graze, and there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.
10679	12	27	11	27	11	When its limbs are dry, they are broken off. Women come and use them for kindling; for this is a people without understanding. Therefore their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.
10680	12	27	12	27	12	In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered one by one.
10681	12	27	13	27	13	And in that day a great ram’s horn will sound, and those who were perishing in Assyria will come forth with those who were exiles in Egypt. And they will worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
10682	12	28	1	28	1	Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards, to the fading flower of his glorious splendor, set on the summit above the fertile valley, the pride of those overcome by wine.
10683	12	28	2	28	2	Behold, the Lord has one who is strong and mighty. Like a hailstorm or destructive tempest, like a driving rain or flooding downpour, he will smash that crown to the ground.
10684	12	28	3	28	3	The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards will be trampled underfoot.
10685	12	28	4	28	4	The fading flower of his beautiful splendor, set on the summit above the fertile valley, will be like a ripe fig before the summer harvest: Whoever sees it will take it in his hand and swallow it.
10686	12	28	5	28	5	On that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory, a diadem of splendor to the remnant of His people,
10687	12	28	6	28	6	a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and a strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.
10688	12	28	7	28	7	These also stagger from wine and stumble from strong drink: Priests and prophets reel from strong drink and are befuddled by wine. They stumble because of strong drink, muddled in their visions and stumbling in their judgments.
10689	12	28	8	28	8	For all their tables are covered with vomit; there is not a place without filth.
10690	12	28	9	28	9	Whom is He trying to teach? To whom is He explaining His message? To infants just weaned from milk? To babies removed from the breast?
10691	12	28	10	28	10	For He says, “Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line; a little here, a little there.”
10692	12	28	11	28	11	Indeed, with mocking lips and foreign tongues, He will speak to this people
10693	12	28	12	28	12	to whom He has said: “This is the place of rest, let the weary rest; this is the place of repose.” But they would not listen.
10694	12	28	13	28	13	Then the word of the LORD will come to them: “Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line; a little here, a little there,” so that they will go stumbling backward and be injured, ensnared, and captured.
10695	12	28	14	28	14	Therefore hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
10696	12	28	15	28	15	For you said, “We have made a covenant with death; we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol. When the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not touch us, because we have made lies our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.”
10697	12	28	16	28	16	So this is what the Lord GOD says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; the one who believes will never be shaken.
10698	12	28	17	28	17	I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the level. Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and water will flood your hiding place.
10699	12	28	18	28	18	Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it.
10700	12	28	19	28	19	As often as it passes through, it will carry you away; it will sweep through morning after morning, by day and by night.” The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
10701	12	28	20	28	20	Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too small to wrap around you.
10702	12	28	21	28	21	For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim. He will rouse Himself as in the valley of Gibeon, to do His work, His strange work, and to perform His task, His disturbing task.
10703	12	28	22	28	22	So now, do not mock, or your shackles will become heavier. Indeed, I have heard from the Lord GOD of Hosts a decree of destruction against the whole land.
10704	12	28	23	28	23	Listen and hear my voice. Pay attention and hear what I say.
10705	12	28	24	28	24	Does the plowman plow for planting every day? Does he continuously loosen and harrow the soil?
10706	12	28	25	28	25	When he has leveled its surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots, and rye within its border.
10707	12	28	26	28	26	For his God instructs and teaches him properly.
10708	12	28	27	28	27	Surely caraway is not threshed with a sledge, and the wheel of a cart is not rolled over the cumin. But caraway is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod.
10709	12	28	28	28	28	Grain for bread must be ground, but it is not endlessly threshed. Though the wheels of the cart roll over it, the horses do not crush it.
10710	12	28	29	28	29	This also comes from the LORD of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom.
10711	12	29	1	29	1	Woe to you, O Ariel, the city of Ariel where David camped! Year upon year let your festivals recur.
10712	12	29	2	29	2	And I will constrain Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation; she will be like an altar hearth before Me.
10713	12	29	3	29	3	I will camp in a circle around you; I will besiege you with towers and set up siege works against you.
10714	12	29	4	29	4	You will be brought low, you will speak from the ground, and out of the dust your words will be muffled. Your voice will be like a spirit from the ground; your speech will whisper out of the dust.
10715	12	29	5	29	5	But your many foes will be like fine dust, the multitude of the ruthless like blowing chaff. Then suddenly, in an instant,
10716	12	29	6	29	6	you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts with thunder and earthquake and loud noise, with windstorm and tempest and consuming flame of fire.
10717	12	29	7	29	7	All the many nations going out to battle against Ariel—even all who war against her, laying siege and attacking her—will be like a dream, like a vision in the night,
10718	12	29	8	29	8	as when a hungry man dreams he is eating, then awakens still hungry; as when a thirsty man dreams he is drinking, then awakens faint and parched. So will it be for all the many nations who go to battle against Mount Zion.
10719	12	29	9	29	9	Stop and be astonished; blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not from strong drink.
10720	12	29	10	29	10	For the LORD has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep. He has shut your eyes, O prophets; He has covered your heads, O seers.
10721	12	29	11	29	11	And the entire vision will be to you like the words sealed in a scroll. If it is handed to someone to read, he will say, “I cannot, because it is sealed.”
10722	12	29	12	29	12	Or if the scroll is handed to one unable to read, he will say, “I cannot read.”
10723	12	29	13	29	13	Therefore the Lord said: “These people draw near to Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men.
10724	12	29	14	29	14	Therefore I will again confound these people with wonder upon wonder. The wisdom of the wise will vanish, and the intelligence of the intelligent will be hidden.”
10725	12	29	15	29	15	Woe to those who dig deep to hide their plans from the LORD. In darkness they do their works and say, “Who sees us, and who will know?”
10726	12	29	16	29	16	You have turned things upside down, as if the potter were regarded as clay. Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, “He did not make me”? Can the pottery say of the potter, “He has no understanding”?
10727	12	29	17	29	17	In a very short time, will not Lebanon become an orchard, and the orchard seem like a forest?
10728	12	29	18	29	18	On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of the deep darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
10729	12	29	19	29	19	The humble will increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
10730	12	29	20	29	20	For the ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who look for evil will be cut down—
10731	12	29	21	29	21	those who indict a man with a word, who ensnare the mediator at the gate, and who with false charges deprive the innocent of justice.
10732	12	29	22	29	22	Therefore the LORD who redeemed Abraham says of the house of Jacob: “No longer will Jacob be ashamed and no more will his face grow pale.
10733	12	29	23	29	23	For when he sees his children around him, the work of My hands, they will honor My name, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
10734	12	29	24	29	24	Then the wayward in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will accept instruction.”
10735	12	30	1	30	1	“Woe to the rebellious children,” declares the LORD, “to those who carry out a plan that is not Mine, who form an alliance, but against My will, heaping up sin upon sin.
10736	12	30	2	30	2	They set out to go down to Egypt without asking My advice, to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection and take refuge in Egypt’s shade.
10737	12	30	3	30	3	But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame, and the refuge of Egypt’s shade your disgrace.
10738	12	30	4	30	4	For though their princes are at Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
10739	12	30	5	30	5	everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them. They cannot be of help; they are good for nothing but shame and reproach.”
10740	12	30	6	30	6	This is the burden against the beasts of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lioness and lion, of viper and flying serpent, they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people of no profit to them.
10741	12	30	7	30	7	Egypt’s help is futile and empty; therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still.
10742	12	30	8	30	8	Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence and inscribe it on a scroll; it will be for the days to come, a witness forever and ever.
10743	12	30	9	30	9	These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to obey the LORD’s instruction.
10744	12	30	10	30	10	They say to the seers, “Stop seeing visions!” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us the truth! Speak to us pleasant words; prophesy illusions.
10745	12	30	11	30	11	Get out of the way; turn off the road. Rid us of the Holy One of Israel!”
10746	12	30	12	30	12	Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message, trusting in oppression and relying on deceit,
10747	12	30	13	30	13	this iniquity of yours is like a breach about to fail, a bulge in a high wall, whose collapse will come suddenly—in an instant!
10748	12	30	14	30	14	It will break in pieces like a potter’s jar, shattered so that no fragment can be found. Not a shard will be found in the dust large enough to scoop the coals from a hearth or to skim the water from a cistern.”
10749	12	30	15	30	15	For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By repentance and rest you would be saved; your strength would lie in quiet confidence—but you were not willing.”
10750	12	30	16	30	16	“No,” you say, “we will flee on horses.” Therefore you will flee! “We will ride swift horses,” but your pursuers will be faster.
10751	12	30	17	30	17	A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee, until you are left alone like a pole on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.
10752	12	30	18	30	18	Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you; therefore He rises to show you compassion, for the LORD is a just God. Blessed are all who wait for Him.
10753	12	30	19	30	19	O people in Zion who dwell in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will surely be gracious when you cry for help; when He hears, He will answer you.
10754	12	30	20	30	20	The Lord will give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, but your Teacher will no longer hide Himself—with your own eyes you will see Him.
10755	12	30	21	30	21	And whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.”
10756	12	30	22	30	22	So you will desecrate your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, saying to them, “Be gone!”
10757	12	30	23	30	23	Then He will send rain for the seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food that comes from your land will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures.
10758	12	30	24	30	24	The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder, winnowed with the shovel and pitchfork.
10759	12	30	25	30	25	And from every high mountain and every raised hill, streams of water will flow in the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall.
10760	12	30	26	30	26	The light of the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days—on the day that the LORD binds up the brokenness of His people and heals the wounds He has inflicted.
10761	12	30	27	30	27	Behold, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense smoke. His lips are full of fury, and His tongue is like a consuming fire.
10762	12	30	28	30	28	His breath is like a rushing torrent that rises to the neck. He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction; He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray.
10763	12	30	29	30	29	You will sing as on the night of a holy festival, and your heart will rejoice like one who walks to the music of a flute, going up to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
10764	12	30	30	30	30	And the LORD will cause His majestic voice to be heard and His mighty arm to be revealed, striking in angry wrath with a flame of consuming fire, and with cloudburst, storm, and hailstones.
10765	12	30	31	30	31	For Assyria will be shattered at the voice of the LORD; He will strike them with His scepter.
10766	12	30	32	30	32	And with every stroke of the rod of punishment that the LORD brings down on them, the tambourines and lyres will sound as He battles with weapons brandished.
10767	12	30	33	30	33	For Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its funeral pyre is deep and wide, with plenty of fire and wood. The breath of the LORD, like a torrent of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
10768	12	31	1	31	1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in their abundance of chariots and in their multitude of horsemen. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel; they do not seek the LORD.
10769	12	31	2	31	2	Yet He too is wise and brings disaster; He does not call back His words. He will rise up against the house of the wicked and against the allies of evildoers.
10770	12	31	3	31	3	But the Egyptians are men, not God; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the LORD stretches out His hand, the helper will stumble, and the one he helps will fall; both will perish together.
10771	12	31	4	31	4	For this is what the LORD has said to me: “Like a lion roaring or a young lion over its prey—and though a band of shepherds is called out against it, it is not terrified by their shouting or subdued by their clamor—so the LORD of Hosts will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and its heights.
10772	12	31	5	31	5	Like birds hovering overhead, so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will shield it and deliver it; He will pass over it and preserve it.”
10773	12	31	6	31	6	Return to the One against whom you have so blatantly rebelled, O children of Israel.
10774	12	31	7	31	7	For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made.
10775	12	31	8	31	8	“Then Assyria will fall, but not by the sword of man; a sword will devour them, but not one made by mortals. They will flee before the sword, and their young men will be put to forced labor.
10776	12	31	9	31	9	Their rock will pass away for fear, and their princes will panic at the sight of the battle standard,” declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
10777	12	32	1	32	1	Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.
10778	12	32	2	32	2	Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.
10779	12	32	3	32	3	Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.
10780	12	32	4	32	4	The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.
10781	12	32	5	32	5	No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected.
10782	12	32	6	32	6	For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.
10783	12	32	7	32	7	The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.
10784	12	32	8	32	8	But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes.
10785	12	32	9	32	9	Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters.
10786	12	32	10	32	10	In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive.
10787	12	32	11	32	11	Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists.
10788	12	32	12	32	12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,
10789	12	32	13	32	13	and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers—even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.
10790	12	32	14	32	14	For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks—
10791	12	32	15	32	15	until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.
10792	12	32	16	32	16	Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.
10793	12	32	17	32	17	The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.
10794	12	32	18	32	18	Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.
10795	12	32	19	32	19	But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths.
10796	12	32	20	32	20	Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.
10797	12	33	1	33	1	Woe to you, O destroyer never destroyed, O traitor never betrayed! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed. When you have finished betraying, you will be betrayed.
10798	12	33	2	33	2	O LORD, be gracious to us! We wait for You. Be our strength every morning and our salvation in time of trouble.
10799	12	33	3	33	3	The peoples flee the thunder of Your voice; the nations scatter when You rise.
10800	12	33	4	33	4	Your spoil, O nations, is gathered as by locusts; like a swarm of locusts men sweep over it.
10801	12	33	5	33	5	The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
10802	12	33	6	33	6	He will be the sure foundation for your times, a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the LORD is Zion’s treasure.
10803	12	33	7	33	7	Behold, their valiant ones cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
10804	12	33	8	33	8	The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. The treaty has been broken, the witnesses are despised, and human life is disregarded.
10805	12	33	9	33	9	The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is ashamed and decayed. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
10806	12	33	10	33	10	“Now I will arise,” says the LORD. “Now I will lift Myself up. Now I will be exalted.
10807	12	33	11	33	11	You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble. Your breath is a fire that will consume you.
10808	12	33	12	33	12	The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and set ablaze.
10809	12	33	13	33	13	You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge My might.”
10810	12	33	14	33	14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling grips the ungodly: “Who of us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?”
10811	12	33	15	33	15	He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, who refuses gain from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears against murderous plots and shuts his eyes tightly against evil—
10812	12	33	16	33	16	he will dwell on the heights; the mountain fortress will be his refuge; his food will be provided and his water assured.
10813	12	33	17	33	17	Your eyes will see the King in His beauty and behold a land that stretches afar.
10814	12	33	18	33	18	Your mind will ponder the former terror: “Where is he who tallies? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?”
10815	12	33	19	33	19	You will no longer see the insolent, a people whose speech is unintelligible, who stammer in a language you cannot understand.
10816	12	33	20	33	20	Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up, nor will any of its cords be broken.
10817	12	33	21	33	21	But there the Majestic One, our LORD, will be for us a place of rivers and wide canals, where no galley with oars will row, and no majestic vessel will pass.
10818	12	33	22	33	22	For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our King. It is He who will save us.
10819	12	33	23	33	23	Your ropes are slack; they cannot secure the mast or spread the sail. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided, and even the lame will carry off plunder.
10820	12	33	24	33	24	And no resident of Zion will say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell there will be forgiven of iniquity.
10821	12	34	1	34	1	Come near, O nations, to listen; pay attention, O peoples. Let the earth hear, and all that fills it, the world and all that springs from it.
10822	12	34	2	34	2	The LORD is angry with all the nations and furious with all their armies. He will devote them to destruction; He will give them over to slaughter.
10823	12	34	3	34	3	Their slain will be left unburied, and the stench of their corpses will rise; the mountains will flow with their blood.
10824	12	34	4	34	4	All the stars of heaven will be dissolved. The skies will be rolled up like a scroll, and all their stars will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like foliage from the fig tree.
10825	12	34	5	34	5	When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens, then it will come down upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to destruction.
10826	12	34	6	34	6	The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood. It drips with fat—with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
10827	12	34	7	34	7	And the wild oxen will fall with them, the young bulls with the strong ones. Their land will be drenched with blood, and their soil will be soaked with fat.
10828	12	34	8	34	8	For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a time of retribution for Edom’s hostility against Zion.
10829	12	34	9	34	9	Her streams will be turned to tar, and her soil to sulfur; her land will become a blazing pitch.
10830	12	34	10	34	10	It will not be quenched—day or night. Its smoke will ascend forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever again pass through it.
10831	12	34	11	34	11	The desert owl and screech owl will possess it, and the great owl and raven will dwell in it. The LORD will stretch out over Edom a measuring line of chaos and a plumb line of destruction.
10832	12	34	12	34	12	No nobles will be left to proclaim a king, and all her princes will come to nothing.
10833	12	34	13	34	13	Her towers will be overgrown with thorns, her fortresses with thistles and briers. She will become a haunt for jackals, an abode for ostriches.
10834	12	34	14	34	14	The desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and one wild goat will call to another. There the night creature will settle and find her place of repose.
10835	12	34	15	34	15	There the owl will make her nest; she will lay and hatch her eggs and gather her brood under her shadow. Even there the birds of prey will gather, each with its mate.
10836	12	34	16	34	16	Search and read the scroll of the LORD: Not one of these will go missing, not one will lack her mate, because He has ordered it by His mouth, and He will gather them by His Spirit.
10837	12	34	17	34	17	He has allotted their portion; His hand has distributed it by measure. They will possess it forever; they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
10838	12	35	1	35	1	The wilderness and the land will be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
10839	12	35	2	35	2	It will bloom profusely and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.
10840	12	35	3	35	3	Strengthen the limp hands and steady the feeble knees!
10841	12	35	4	35	4	Say to those with anxious hearts: “Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance. With divine retribution He will come to save you.”
10842	12	35	5	35	5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
10843	12	35	6	35	6	Then the lame will leap like a deer and the mute tongue will shout for joy. For waters will gush forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
10844	12	35	7	35	7	The parched ground will become a pool, the thirsty land springs of water. In the haunt where jackals once lay, there will be grass and reeds and papyrus.
10845	12	35	8	35	8	And there will be a highway called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel it—only those who walk in the Way—and fools will not stray onto it.
10846	12	35	9	35	9	No lion will be there, and no vicious beast will go up on it. Such will not be found there, but the redeemed will walk upon it.
10847	12	35	10	35	10	And the ransomed of the LORD will return and will enter Zion with singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Joy and gladness will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee.
10848	12	36	1	36	1	In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah.
10849	12	36	2	36	2	And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh, with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.
10850	12	36	3	36	3	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to him.
10851	12	36	4	36	4	The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours?
10852	12	36	5	36	5	You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me?
10853	12	36	6	36	6	Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
10854	12	36	7	36	7	But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before this altar’?
10855	12	36	8	36	8	Now therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
10856	12	36	9	36	9	For how can you repel a single officer among the weakest of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
10857	12	36	10	36	10	So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”
10858	12	36	11	36	11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
10859	12	36	12	36	12	But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
10860	12	36	13	36	13	Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
10861	12	36	14	36	14	This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you.
10862	12	36	15	36	15	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
10863	12	36	16	36	16	Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern,
10864	12	36	17	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
10865	12	36	18	36	18	Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
10866	12	36	19	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
10867	12	36	20	36	20	Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
10868	12	36	21	36	21	But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
10869	12	36	22	36	22	Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh.
10870	12	37	1	37	1	On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD.
10871	12	37	2	37	2	He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
10872	12	37	3	37	3	to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them.
10873	12	37	4	37	4	Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.”
10874	12	37	5	37	5	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,
10875	12	37	6	37	6	who replied, “Tell your master that this is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
10876	12	37	7	37	7	Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own land, where I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”
10877	12	37	8	37	8	When the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
10878	12	37	9	37	9	Now Sennacherib had been warned about Tirhakah king of Cush: “He has set out to fight against you.” On hearing this, Sennacherib sent messengers to Hezekiah with the order:
10879	12	37	10	37	10	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
10880	12	37	11	37	11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction. Will you then be spared?
10881	12	37	12	37	12	Did the gods of the nations destroyed by my fathers rescue those nations—the gods of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and of the people of Eden in Telassar?
10882	12	37	13	37	13	Where are the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
10883	12	37	14	37	14	So Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, read it, and went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
10884	12	37	15	37	15	And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
10885	12	37	16	37	16	“O LORD of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth.
10886	12	37	17	37	17	Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see. Listen to all the words that Sennacherib has sent to defy the living God.
10887	12	37	18	37	18	Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all these countries and their lands.
10888	12	37	19	37	19	They have cast their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods, but only wood and stone—the work of human hands.
10889	12	37	20	37	20	And now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, O LORD, are God.”
10890	12	37	21	37	21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
10891	12	37	22	37	22	this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: ‘The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.
10892	12	37	23	37	23	Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
10893	12	37	24	37	24	Through your servants you have taunted the Lord, and you have said: “With my many chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the remote peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the finest of its cypresses. I have reached its farthest heights, the densest of its forests.
10894	12	37	25	37	25	I have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.”
10895	12	37	26	37	26	Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it; in days of old I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.
10896	12	37	27	37	27	Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power, are dismayed and ashamed. They are like plants in the field, tender green shoots, grass on the rooftops, scorched before it is grown.
10897	12	37	28	37	28	But I know your sitting down, your going out and your coming in, and your raging against Me.
10898	12	37	29	37	29	Because your rage and arrogance against Me have reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bit in your mouth; I will send you back the way you came.’
10899	12	37	30	37	30	And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah: This year you will eat what grows on its own, and in the second year what springs from the same. But in the third year you will sow and reap; you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
10900	12	37	31	37	31	And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below and bear fruit above.
10901	12	37	32	37	32	For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.
10902	12	37	33	37	33	So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow into it. He will not come before it with a shield or build up a siege ramp against it.
10903	12	37	34	37	34	He will go back the way he came, and he will not enter this city,’ declares the LORD.
10904	12	37	35	37	35	‘I will defend this city and save it for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.’”
10905	12	37	36	37	36	Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people got up the next morning, there were all the dead bodies!
10906	12	37	37	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned home to Nineveh and stayed there.
10907	12	37	38	37	38	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place.
10908	12	38	1	38	1	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.”
10909	12	38	2	38	2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
10910	12	38	3	38	3	saying, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
10911	12	38	4	38	4	And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
10912	12	38	5	38	5	“Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
10913	12	38	6	38	6	And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.’
10914	12	38	7	38	7	This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised:
10915	12	38	8	38	8	I will make the sun’s shadow that falls on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had descended.
10916	12	38	9	38	9	This is a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
10917	12	38	10	38	10	I said, “In the prime of my life I must go through the gates of Sheol and be deprived of the remainder of my years.”
10918	12	38	11	38	11	I said, “I will never again see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living; I will no longer look on mankind with those who dwell in this world.
10919	12	38	12	38	12	My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have rolled up my life like a weaver; He cuts me off from the loom; from day until night You make an end of me.
10920	12	38	13	38	13	I composed myself until the morning. Like a lion He breaks all my bones; from day until night You make an end of me.
10921	12	38	14	38	14	I chirp like a swallow or crane; I moan like a dove. My eyes grow weak as I look upward. O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security.”
10922	12	38	15	38	15	What can I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done this. I will walk slowly all my years because of the anguish of my soul.
10923	12	38	16	38	16	O Lord, by such things men live, and in all of them my spirit finds life. You have restored me to health and let me live.
10924	12	38	17	38	17	Surely, for my welfare I had such great anguish; but Your love has delivered me from the pit of oblivion, for You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
10925	12	38	18	38	18	For Sheol cannot thank You; Death cannot praise You. Those who descend to the Pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.
10926	12	38	19	38	19	The living, only the living, can thank You, as I do today; fathers will tell their children about Your faithfulness.
10927	12	38	20	38	20	The LORD will save me; we will play songs on stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the LORD.
10928	12	38	21	38	21	Now Isaiah had said, “Prepare a lump of pressed figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”
10929	12	38	22	38	22	And Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the LORD?”
10930	12	39	1	39	1	At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard about Hezekiah’s illness and recovery.
10931	12	39	2	39	2	And Hezekiah welcomed the envoys and showed them what was in his treasure house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his entire armory—everything that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
10932	12	39	3	39	3	Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did they say to you?” “They came to me from a distant land,” Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.”
10933	12	39	4	39	4	“What have they seen in your palace?” Isaiah asked. “They have seen everything in my palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”
10934	12	39	5	39	5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of Hosts:
10935	12	39	6	39	6	The time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
10936	12	39	7	39	7	And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
10937	12	39	8	39	8	But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “At least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.”
10938	12	40	1	40	1	“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.
10939	12	40	2	40	2	“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her forced labor has been completed; her iniquity has been pardoned. For she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.”
10940	12	40	3	40	3	A voice of one calling: “Prepare the way for the LORD in the wilderness; make a straight highway for our God in the desert.
10941	12	40	4	40	4	Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill made low; the uneven ground will become smooth, and the rugged land a plain.
10942	12	40	5	40	5	And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all humanity together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”
10943	12	40	6	40	6	A voice says, “Cry out!” And I asked, “What should I cry out?” “All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flowers of the field.
10944	12	40	7	40	7	The grass withers and the flowers fall when the breath of the LORD blows on them; indeed, the people are grass.
10945	12	40	8	40	8	The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.”
10946	12	40	9	40	9	Go up on a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news. Raise your voice loudly, O Jerusalem, herald of good news. Lift it up, do not be afraid! Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!”
10947	12	40	10	40	10	Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and His arm establishes His rule. His reward is with Him, and His recompense accompanies Him.
10948	12	40	11	40	11	He tends His flock like a shepherd; He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them close to His heart. He gently leads the nursing ewes.
10949	12	40	12	40	12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or marked off the heavens with the span of his hand? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on a scale and the hills with a balance?
10950	12	40	13	40	13	Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or informed Him as His counselor?
10951	12	40	14	40	14	Whom did He consult to enlighten Him, and who taught Him the paths of justice? Who imparted knowledge to Him and showed Him the way of understanding?
10952	12	40	15	40	15	Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are considered a speck of dust on the scales; He lifts up the islands like fine dust.
10953	12	40	16	40	16	Lebanon is not sufficient for fuel, nor its animals enough for a burnt offering.
10954	12	40	17	40	17	All the nations are as nothing before Him; He regards them as nothingness and emptiness.
10955	12	40	18	40	18	To whom will you liken God? To what image will you compare Him?
10956	12	40	19	40	19	To an idol that a craftsman casts and a metalworker overlays with gold and fits with silver chains?
10957	12	40	20	40	20	To one bereft of an offering who chooses wood that will not rot, who seeks a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple?
10958	12	40	21	40	21	Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the foundation of the earth?
10959	12	40	22	40	22	He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth; its dwellers are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
10960	12	40	23	40	23	He brings the princes to nothing and makes the rulers of the earth meaningless.
10961	12	40	24	40	24	No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner have their stems taken root in the ground, than He blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like stubble.
10962	12	40	25	40	25	“To whom will you compare Me, or who is My equal?” asks the Holy One.
10963	12	40	26	40	26	Lift up your eyes on high: Who created all these? He leads forth the starry host by number; He calls each one by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
10964	12	40	27	40	27	Why do you say, O Jacob, and why do you assert, O Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD, and my claim is ignored by my God”?
10965	12	40	28	40	28	Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He never grows faint or weary; His understanding is beyond searching out.
10966	12	40	29	40	29	He gives power to the faint and increases the strength of the weak.
10967	12	40	30	40	30	Even youths may faint and grow weary, and young men stumble and fall.
10968	12	40	31	40	31	But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint.
10969	12	41	1	41	1	“Be silent before Me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength. Let them come forward and testify; let us together draw near for judgment.
10970	12	41	2	41	2	Who has aroused one from the east and called him to his feet in righteousness? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow.
10971	12	41	3	41	3	He pursues them, going on safely, hardly touching the path with his feet.
10972	12	41	4	41	4	Who has performed this and carried it out, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD—the first and the last—I am He.”
10973	12	41	5	41	5	The islands see and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward.
10974	12	41	6	41	6	Each one helps the other and says to his brother, “Be strong!”
10975	12	41	7	41	7	The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who wields the hammer cheers him who strikes the anvil, saying of the welding, “It is good.” He nails it down so it will not be toppled.
10976	12	41	8	41	8	“But you, O Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham My friend—
10977	12	41	9	41	9	I brought you from the ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I said, ‘You are My servant.’ I have chosen and not rejected you.
10978	12	41	10	41	10	Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; I will surely help you; I will uphold you with My right hand of righteousness.
10979	12	41	11	41	11	Behold, all who rage against you will be ashamed and disgraced; those who contend with you will be reduced to nothing and will perish.
10980	12	41	12	41	12	You will seek them but will not find them. Those who wage war against you will come to nothing.
10981	12	41	13	41	13	For I am the LORD your God, who takes hold of your right hand and tells you: Do not fear, I will help you.
10982	12	41	14	41	14	Do not fear, O worm of Jacob, O few men of Israel. I will help you,” declares the LORD. “Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
10983	12	41	15	41	15	Behold, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
10984	12	41	16	41	16	You will winnow them, and a wind will carry them away; a gale will scatter them. But you will rejoice in the LORD; you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
10985	12	41	17	41	17	The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
10986	12	41	18	41	18	I will open rivers on the barren heights, and fountains in the middle of the valleys. I will turn the desert into a pool of water, and the dry land into flowing springs.
10987	12	41	19	41	19	I will plant cedars in the wilderness, acacias, myrtles, and olive trees. I will set cypresses in the desert, elms and boxwood together,
10988	12	41	20	41	20	so that all may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.”
10989	12	41	21	41	21	“Present your case,” says the LORD. “Submit your arguments,” says the King of Jacob.
10990	12	41	22	41	22	“Let them come and tell us what will happen. Tell the former things, so that we may reflect on them and know the outcome. Or announce to us what is coming.
10991	12	41	23	41	23	Tell us the things that are to come, so that we may know that you are gods. Yes, do something good or evil, that we may look on together in dismay.
10992	12	41	24	41	24	Behold, you are nothing and your work is of no value. Anyone who chooses you is detestable.
10993	12	41	25	41	25	I have raised up one from the north, and he has come—one from the east who calls on My name. He will march over rulers as if they were mortar, like a potter who treads the clay.
10994	12	41	26	41	26	Who has declared this from the beginning, so that we may know, and from times past, so that we may say: ‘He was right’? No one announced it, no one foretold it, no one heard your words.
10995	12	41	27	41	27	I was the first to tell Zion: ‘Look, here they are!’ And I gave to Jerusalem a herald of good news.
10996	12	41	28	41	28	When I look, there is no one; there is no counselor among them; when I ask them, they have nothing to say.
10997	12	41	29	41	29	See, they are all a delusion; their works amount to nothing; their images are as empty as the wind.”
10998	12	42	1	42	1	“Here is My Servant, whom I uphold, My Chosen One, in whom My soul delights. I will put My Spirit on Him, and He will bring justice to the nations.
10999	12	42	2	42	2	He will not cry out or raise His voice, nor make His voice heard in the streets.
11000	12	42	3	42	3	A bruised reed He will not break and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice.
11001	12	42	4	42	4	He will not grow weak or discouraged before He has established justice on the earth. In His law the islands will put their hope.”
11002	12	42	5	42	5	This is what God the LORD says—He who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who walk in it:
11003	12	42	6	42	6	“I, the LORD, have called you for a righteous purpose, and I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and appoint you to be a covenant for the people and a light to the nations,
11004	12	42	7	42	7	to open the eyes of the blind, to bring prisoners out of the dungeon and those sitting in darkness out from the prison house.
11005	12	42	8	42	8	I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not yield My glory to another or My praise to idols.
11006	12	42	9	42	9	Behold, the former things have happened, and now I declare new things. Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you.”
11007	12	42	10	42	10	Sing to the LORD a new song, His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who dwell in them.
11008	12	42	11	42	11	Let the desert and its cities raise their voices; let the villages of Kedar cry aloud. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops.
11009	12	42	12	42	12	Let them give glory to the LORD and declare His praise in the islands.
11010	12	42	13	42	13	The LORD goes forth like a mighty one; He stirs up His zeal like a warrior. He shouts; yes, He roars. He prevails against His enemies.
11011	12	42	14	42	14	I have kept silent from ages past; I have remained quiet and restrained. But now I will groan like a woman in labor; I will at once gasp and pant.
11012	12	42	15	42	15	I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation. I will turn the rivers into dry land and drain the marshes.
11013	12	42	16	42	16	I will lead the blind by a way they did not know; I will guide them on unfamiliar paths. I will turn darkness into light before them and rough places into level ground. These things I will do for them, and I will not forsake them.
11014	12	42	17	42	17	But those who trust in idols and say to molten images, ‘You are our gods!’ will be turned back in utter shame.
11015	12	42	18	42	18	“Listen, you deaf ones; look, you blind ones, that you may see!
11016	12	42	19	42	19	Who is blind but My servant, or deaf like the messenger I am sending? Who is blind like My covenant partner, or blind like the servant of the LORD?
11017	12	42	20	42	20	Though seeing many things, you do not keep watch. Though your ears are open, you do not hear.”
11018	12	42	21	42	21	The LORD was pleased, for the sake of His righteousness, to magnify His law and make it glorious.
11019	12	42	22	42	22	But this is a people plundered and looted, all trapped in caves or imprisoned in dungeons. They have become plunder with no one to rescue them, and loot with no one to say, “Send them back!”
11020	12	42	23	42	23	Who among you will pay attention to this? Who will listen and obey hereafter?
11021	12	42	24	42	24	Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? They were unwilling to walk in His ways, and they would not obey His law.
11022	12	42	25	42	25	So He poured out on them His furious anger and the fierceness of battle. It enveloped them in flames, but they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
11023	12	43	1	43	1	Now this is what the LORD says—He who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel: “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine!
11024	12	43	2	43	2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you go through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched; the flames will not set you ablaze.
11025	12	43	3	43	3	For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your place.
11026	12	43	4	43	4	Because you are precious and honored in My sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you and nations in place of your life.
11027	12	43	5	43	5	Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west.
11028	12	43	6	43	6	I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back!’ Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth—
11029	12	43	7	43	7	everyone called by My name and created for My glory, whom I have indeed formed and made.”
11030	12	43	8	43	8	Bring out a people who have eyes but are blind, and who have ears but are deaf.
11031	12	43	9	43	9	All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Who among them can declare this, and proclaim to us the former things? Let them present their witnesses to vindicate them, so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”
11032	12	43	10	43	10	“You are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and My servant whom I have chosen, so that you may consider and believe Me and understand that I am He. Before Me, no god was formed, and after Me none will come.
11033	12	43	11	43	11	I, yes I, am the LORD, and there is no Savior but Me.
11034	12	43	12	43	12	I alone decreed and saved and proclaimed—I, and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “that I am God.
11035	12	43	13	43	13	Even from eternity I am He, and none can deliver out of My hand. When I act, who can reverse it?”
11036	12	43	14	43	14	Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “For your sake, I will send to Babylon and bring them all as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships in which they rejoice.
11037	12	43	15	43	15	I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, and your King.”
11038	12	43	16	43	16	Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea and a path through the surging waters,
11039	12	43	17	43	17	who brings out the chariots and horses, the armies and warriors together, to lie down, never to rise again; to be extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
11040	12	43	18	43	18	“Do not call to mind the former things; pay no attention to the things of old.
11041	12	43	19	43	19	Behold, I am about to do something new; even now it is coming. Do you not see it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
11042	12	43	20	43	20	The beasts of the field will honor Me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My chosen people.
11043	12	43	21	43	21	The people I formed for Myself will declare My praise.
11044	12	43	22	43	22	But you have not called on Me, O Jacob, because you have grown weary of Me, O Israel.
11045	12	43	23	43	23	You have not brought Me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied you with frankincense.
11046	12	43	24	43	24	You have not bought Me sweet cane with your silver, nor satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
11047	12	43	25	43	25	I, yes I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake and remembers your sins no more.
11048	12	43	26	43	26	Remind Me, let us argue the matter together. State your case, so that you may be vindicated.
11049	12	43	27	43	27	Your first father sinned, and your spokesmen rebelled against Me.
11050	12	43	28	43	28	So I will disgrace the princes of your sanctuary, and I will devote Jacob to destruction and Israel to reproach.”
11051	12	44	1	44	1	But now listen, O Jacob My servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.
11052	12	44	2	44	2	This is the word of the LORD, your Maker, who formed you from the womb and who will help you: “Do not be afraid, O Jacob My servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
11053	12	44	3	44	3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and currents on the dry ground. I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants, and My blessing on your offspring.
11054	12	44	4	44	4	They will sprout among the grass like willows by flowing streams.
11055	12	44	5	44	5	One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’ another will call himself by the name of Jacob, and still another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’ and will take the name of Israel.”
11056	12	44	6	44	6	Thus says the LORD, the King and Redeemer of Israel, the LORD of Hosts: “I am the first and I am the last, and there is no God but Me.
11057	12	44	7	44	7	Who then is like Me? Let him say so! Let him declare his case before Me, since I established an ancient people. Let him foretell the things to come, and what is to take place.
11058	12	44	8	44	8	Do not tremble or fear. Have I not told you and declared it long ago? You are My witnesses! Is there any God but Me? There is no other Rock; I know not one.”
11059	12	44	9	44	9	All makers of idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Their witnesses fail to see or comprehend, so they are put to shame.
11060	12	44	10	44	10	Who fashions a god or casts an idol which profits him nothing?
11061	12	44	11	44	11	Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are only human. Let them all assemble and take their stand; they will all be brought to terror and shame.
11062	12	44	12	44	12	The blacksmith takes a tool and labors over the coals; he fashions an idol with hammers and forges it with his strong arms. Yet he grows hungry and loses his strength; he fails to drink water and grows faint.
11063	12	44	13	44	13	The woodworker extends a measuring line; he marks it out with a stylus; he shapes it with chisels and outlines it with a compass. He fashions it in the likeness of man, like man in all his glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.
11064	12	44	14	44	14	He cuts down cedars or retrieves a cypress or oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow.
11065	12	44	15	44	15	It serves as fuel for man. He takes some of it to warm himself, and he kindles a fire and bakes his bread; he even fashions it into a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
11066	12	44	16	44	16	He burns half of it in the fire, and he roasts meat on that half. He eats the roast and is satisfied. Indeed, he warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”
11067	12	44	17	44	17	From the rest he makes a god, his graven image. He bows down to it and worships; he prays to it and says, “Save me, for you are my god.”
11068	12	44	18	44	18	They do not comprehend or discern, for He has shut their eyes so they cannot see and closed their minds so they cannot understand.
11069	12	44	19	44	19	And no one considers in his heart, no one has the knowledge or insight to say, “I burned half of it in the fire, and I baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
11070	12	44	20	44	20	He feeds on ashes. His deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
11071	12	44	21	44	21	Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are My servant, O Israel. I have made you; you are My servant; O Israel, I will never forget you.
11072	12	44	22	44	22	I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.
11073	12	44	23	44	23	Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, O depths of the earth. Break out into singing, O mountains, you forests and all your trees. For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and revealed His glory in Israel.
11074	12	44	24	44	24	Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer who formed you from the womb: “I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who by Myself spread out the earth,
11075	12	44	25	44	25	who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who confounds the wise and turns their knowledge into nonsense,
11076	12	44	26	44	26	who confirms the message of His servant and fulfills the counsel of His messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’ and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt, and I will restore their ruins,’
11077	12	44	27	44	27	who says to the depths of the sea, ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your currents,’
11078	12	44	28	44	28	who says of Cyrus, ‘My shepherd will fulfill all that I desire,’ who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘Let its foundation be laid.’”
11079	12	45	1	45	1	This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him, to disarm kings, to open the doors before him, so that the gates will not be shut:
11080	12	45	2	45	2	“I will go before you and level the mountains; I will break down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.
11081	12	45	3	45	3	I will give you the treasures of darkness and the riches hidden in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by name.
11082	12	45	4	45	4	For the sake of Jacob My servant and Israel My chosen one, I call you by name; I have given you a title of honor, though you have not known Me.
11083	12	45	5	45	5	I am the LORD, and there is no other; there is no God but Me. I will equip you for battle, though you have not known Me,
11084	12	45	6	45	6	so that all may know, from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting, that there is none but Me; I am the LORD, and there is no other.
11085	12	45	7	45	7	I form the light and create the darkness; I bring prosperity and create calamity. I, the LORD, do all these things.
11086	12	45	8	45	8	Drip down, O heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness. Let the earth open up that salvation may sprout and righteousness spring up with it; I, the LORD, have created it.
11087	12	45	9	45	9	Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker—one clay pot among many. Does the clay ask the potter, ‘What are you making?’ Does your work say, ‘He has no hands’?
11088	12	45	10	45	10	Woe to him who says to his father, ‘What have you begotten?’ or to his mother, ‘What have you brought forth?’”
11089	12	45	11	45	11	Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: “How dare you question Me concerning My sons, or instruct Me about the work of My hands?
11090	12	45	12	45	12	It is I who made the earth and created man upon it. It was My hands that stretched out the heavens, and I ordained all their host.
11091	12	45	13	45	13	I will raise up Cyrus in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild My city and set My exiles free, but not for payment or reward, says the LORD of Hosts.”
11092	12	45	14	45	14	This is what the LORD says: “The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, along with the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you and will be yours; they will trudge behind you; they will come over in chains and bow down to you. They will confess to you: ‘God is indeed with you, and there is no other; there is no other God.’”
11093	12	45	15	45	15	Truly You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
11094	12	45	16	45	16	They will all be put to shame and humiliated; the makers of idols will go away together in disgrace.
11095	12	45	17	45	17	But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will not be put to shame or humiliated, to ages everlasting.
11096	12	45	18	45	18	For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens—He is God; He formed the earth and fashioned it; He established it; He did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited: “I am the LORD, and there is no other.
11097	12	45	19	45	19	I have not spoken in secret, from a place in a land of darkness. I did not say to the descendants of Jacob, ‘Seek Me in a wasteland.’ I, the LORD, speak the truth; I say what is right.
11098	12	45	20	45	20	Come, gather together, and draw near, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry idols of wood and pray to a god that cannot save.
11099	12	45	21	45	21	Speak up and present your case—yes, let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago? Who announced it from ancient times? Was it not I, the LORD? There is no other God but Me, a righteous God and Savior; there is none but Me.
11100	12	45	22	45	22	Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
11101	12	45	23	45	23	By Myself I have sworn; truth has gone out from My mouth, a word that will not be revoked: Every knee will bow before Me, every tongue will swear allegiance.
11102	12	45	24	45	24	Surely they will say of Me, ‘In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.’” All who rage against Him will come to Him and be put to shame.
11103	12	45	25	45	25	In the LORD all descendants of Israel will be justified and will exult.
11104	12	46	1	46	1	Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. Their idols weigh down beasts and cattle. The images you carry are burdensome, a load to the weary animal.
11105	12	46	2	46	2	The gods cower; they crouch together, unable to relieve the burden; but they themselves go into captivity.
11106	12	46	3	46	3	“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been sustained from the womb, carried along since birth.
11107	12	46	4	46	4	Even to your old age, I will be the same, and I will bear you up when you turn gray. I have made you, and I will carry you; I will sustain you and deliver you.
11108	12	46	5	46	5	To whom will you liken Me or count Me equal? To whom will you compare Me, that we should be alike?
11109	12	46	6	46	6	They pour out their bags of gold and weigh out silver on scales; they hire a goldsmith to fashion it into a god, so they can bow down and worship.
11110	12	46	7	46	7	They lift it to their shoulder and carry it along; they set it in its place, and there it stands, not budging from that spot. They cry out to it, but it does not answer; it saves no one from his troubles.
11111	12	46	8	46	8	Remember this and be brave; take it to heart, you transgressors!
11112	12	46	9	46	9	Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me.
11113	12	46	10	46	10	I declare the end from the beginning, and ancient times from what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and all My good pleasure I will accomplish.’
11114	12	46	11	46	11	I summon a bird of prey from the east, a man for My purpose from a far-off land. Truly I have spoken, truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, I will surely do it.
11115	12	46	12	46	12	Listen to Me, you stubborn people, far removed from righteousness:
11116	12	46	13	46	13	I am bringing My righteousness near; it is not far away, and My salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion and adorn Israel with My splendor.”
11117	12	47	1	47	1	“Go down and sit in the dust, O Virgin Daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground without a throne, O Daughter of Chaldea! For you will no longer be called tender or delicate.
11118	12	47	2	47	2	Take millstones and grind flour; remove your veil; strip off your skirt, bare your thigh, and wade through the streams.
11119	12	47	3	47	3	Your nakedness will be uncovered and your shame will be exposed. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one.”
11120	12	47	4	47	4	Our Redeemer—the LORD of Hosts is His name—is the Holy One of Israel.
11121	12	47	5	47	5	“Sit in silence and go into darkness, O Daughter of Chaldea. For you will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.
11122	12	47	6	47	6	I was angry with My people; I profaned My heritage, and I placed them under your control. You showed them no mercy; even on the elderly you laid a most heavy yoke.
11123	12	47	7	47	7	You said, ‘I will be queen forever.’ You did not take these things to heart or consider their outcome.
11124	12	47	8	47	8	So now hear this, O lover of luxury who sits securely, who says to herself, ‘I am, and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or know the loss of children.’
11125	12	47	9	47	9	These two things will overtake you in a moment, in a single day: loss of children, and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and the potency of your spells.
11126	12	47	10	47	10	You were secure in your wickedness; you said, ‘No one sees me.’ Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray; you told yourself, ‘I am, and there is none besides me.’
11127	12	47	11	47	11	But disaster will come upon you; you will not know how to charm it away. A calamity will befall you that you will be unable to ward off. Devastation will happen to you suddenly and unexpectedly.
11128	12	47	12	47	12	So take your stand with your spells and with your many sorceries, with which you have wearied yourself from your youth. Perhaps you will succeed; perhaps you will inspire terror!
11129	12	47	13	47	13	You are wearied by your many counselors; let them come forward now and save you—your astrologers who observe the stars, who monthly predict your fate.
11130	12	47	14	47	14	Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame. There will be no coals to warm them or fire to sit beside.
11131	12	47	15	47	15	This is what they are to you—those with whom you have labored and traded from youth—each one strays in his own direction; not one of them can save you.”
11132	12	48	1	48	1	“Listen to this, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel, who have descended from the line of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD, who invoke the God of Israel—but not in truth or righteousness—
11133	12	48	2	48	2	who indeed call yourselves after the Holy City and lean on the God of Israel; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
11134	12	48	3	48	3	I foretold the former things long ago; they came out of My mouth and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
11135	12	48	4	48	4	For I knew that you are stubborn; your neck is iron and your forehead is bronze.
11136	12	48	5	48	5	Therefore I declared it to you long ago; I announced it before it came to pass, so that you could not claim, ‘My idol has done this; my carved image and molten god has ordained it.’
11137	12	48	6	48	6	You have heard these things; look at them all. Will you not acknowledge them? From now on I will tell you of new things, hidden things unknown to you.
11138	12	48	7	48	7	They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot claim, ‘I already knew them!’
11139	12	48	8	48	8	You have never heard; you have never understood; for a long time your ears have not been open. For I knew how deceitful you are; you have been called a rebel from birth.
11140	12	48	9	48	9	For the sake of My name I will delay My wrath; for the sake of My praise I will restrain it, so that you will not be cut off.
11141	12	48	10	48	10	See, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
11142	12	48	11	48	11	For My own sake, My very own sake, I will act; for how can I let Myself be defamed? I will not yield My glory to another.
11143	12	48	12	48	12	Listen to Me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I have called: I am He; I am the first, and I am the last.
11144	12	48	13	48	13	Surely My own hand founded the earth, and My right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they stand up together.
11145	12	48	14	48	14	Come together, all of you, and listen: Which of the idols has foretold these things? The LORD’s chosen ally will carry out His desire against Babylon, and His arm will be against the Chaldeans.
11146	12	48	15	48	15	I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I have brought him, and he will succeed in his mission.
11147	12	48	16	48	16	Come near to Me and listen to this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time it happened, I was there.” And now the Lord GOD has sent me, accompanied by His Spirit.
11148	12	48	17	48	17	Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “I am the LORD your God, who teaches you for your benefit, who directs you in the way you should go.
11149	12	48	18	48	18	If only you had paid attention to My commandments, your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like waves of the sea.
11150	12	48	19	48	19	Your descendants would have been as countless as the sand, and your offspring as numerous as its grains; their name would never be cut off or eliminated from My presence.”
11151	12	48	20	48	20	Leave Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare it with a shout of joy, proclaim it, let it go out to the ends of the earth, saying, “The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!”
11152	12	48	21	48	21	They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He made water flow for them from the rock; He split the rock, and water gushed out.
11153	12	48	22	48	22	“There is no peace,” says the LORD, “for the wicked.”
11154	12	49	1	49	1	Listen to Me, O islands; pay attention, O distant peoples: The LORD called Me from the womb; from the body of My mother He named Me.
11155	12	49	2	49	2	He made My mouth like a sharp sword; He hid Me in the shadow of His hand. He made Me like a polished arrow; He hid Me in His quiver.
11156	12	49	3	49	3	He said to Me, “You are My servant, Israel, in whom I will display My glory.”
11157	12	49	4	49	4	But I said, “I have labored in vain, I have spent My strength in futility and vanity; yet My vindication is with the LORD, and My reward is with My God.”
11158	12	49	5	49	5	And now says the LORD, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, to bring Jacob back to Him, that Israel might be gathered to Him—for I am honored in the sight of the LORD, and My God is My strength—
11159	12	49	6	49	6	He says: “It is not enough for You to be My Servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the protected ones of Israel. I will also make You a light for the nations, to bring My salvation to the ends of the earth.”
11160	12	49	7	49	7	Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel, to Him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers: “Kings will see You and rise, and princes will bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.”
11161	12	49	8	49	8	This is what the LORD says: “In the time of favor I will answer You, and in the day of salvation I will help You; I will keep You and appoint You to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land, to apportion its desolate inheritances,
11162	12	49	9	49	9	to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’ and to those in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’ They will feed along the pathways, and find pasture on every barren hill.
11163	12	49	10	49	10	They will not hunger or thirst, nor will scorching heat or sun beat down on them. For He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
11164	12	49	11	49	11	I will turn all My mountains into roads, and My highways will be raised up.
11165	12	49	12	49	12	Behold, they will come from far away, from the north and from the west, and from the land of Aswan.”
11166	12	49	13	49	13	Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth; break into joyful song, O mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people, and He will have compassion on His afflicted ones.
11167	12	49	14	49	14	But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me; the Lord has forgotten me!”
11168	12	49	15	49	15	“Can a woman forget her nursing child, or lack compassion for the son of her womb? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!
11169	12	49	16	49	16	Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; your walls are ever before Me.
11170	12	49	17	49	17	Your builders hasten back; your destroyers and wreckers depart from you.
11171	12	49	18	49	18	Lift up your eyes and look around. They all gather together; they come to you. As surely as I live,” declares the LORD, “you will wear them all as jewelry and put them on like a bride.
11172	12	49	19	49	19	For your ruined and desolate places and your ravaged land will now indeed be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away.
11173	12	49	20	49	20	Yet the children of your bereavement will say in your hearing, ‘This place is too small for us; make room for us to live here.’
11174	12	49	21	49	21	Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has begotten these for me? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. So who has reared them? Look, I was left all alone, so where did they come from?’”
11175	12	49	22	49	22	This is what the Lord GOD says: “Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and raise My banner to the peoples. They will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
11176	12	49	23	49	23	Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow to you facedown and lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in Me will never be put to shame.”
11177	12	49	24	49	24	Can the plunder be snatched from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?
11178	12	49	25	49	25	For this is what the LORD says: “Even the captives of the mighty will be taken away, and the plunder of the tyrant will be retrieved; I will contend with those who contend with you, and I will save your children.
11179	12	49	26	49	26	I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
11180	12	50	1	50	1	This is what the LORD says: “Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of My creditors did I sell you? Look, you were sold for your iniquities, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.
11181	12	50	2	50	2	Why was no one there when I arrived? Why did no one answer when I called? Is My hand too short to redeem you? Or do I lack the strength to deliver you? Behold, My rebuke dries up the sea; I turn the rivers into a desert; the fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
11182	12	50	3	50	3	I clothe the heavens in black and make sackcloth their covering.”
11183	12	50	4	50	4	The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of discipleship, to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning; He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.
11184	12	50	5	50	5	The Lord GOD has opened My ears, and I have not been rebellious, nor have I turned back.
11185	12	50	6	50	6	I offered My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. I did not hide My face from scorn and spittle.
11186	12	50	7	50	7	Because the Lord GOD helps Me, I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know that I will not be put to shame.
11187	12	50	8	50	8	The One who vindicates Me is near. Who will dare to contend with Me? Let us confront each other! Who has a case against Me? Let him approach Me!
11188	12	50	9	50	9	Surely the Lord GOD helps Me. Who is there to condemn Me? See, they will all wear out like a garment; the moths will devour them.
11189	12	50	10	50	10	Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of His Servant? Who among you walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD; let him lean on his God.
11190	12	50	11	50	11	Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who array yourselves with firebrands, walk in the light of your fire and of the firebrands you have lit! This is what you will receive from My hand: You will lie down in a place of torment.
11191	12	51	1	51	1	“Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness, you who seek the LORD: Look to the rock from which you were cut, and to the quarry from which you were hewn.
11192	12	51	2	51	2	Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who gave you birth. When I called him, he was but one; then I blessed him and multiplied him.
11193	12	51	3	51	3	For the LORD will comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; He will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and melodious song.
11194	12	51	4	51	4	Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation; for a law will go out from Me, and My justice will become a light to the nations; I will bring it about quickly.
11195	12	51	5	51	5	My righteousness draws near, My salvation is on the way, and My arms will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look for Me and wait in hope for My arm.
11196	12	51	6	51	6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth below; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment, and its people will die like gnats. But My salvation will last forever, and My righteousness will never fail.
11197	12	51	7	51	7	Listen to Me, you who know what is right, you people with My law in your hearts: Do not fear the scorn of men; do not be broken by their insults.
11198	12	51	8	51	8	For the moth will devour them like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool. But My righteousness will last forever, My salvation through all generations.”
11199	12	51	9	51	9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD. Wake up as in days past, as in generations of long ago. Was it not You who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced through the dragon?
11200	12	51	10	51	10	Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made a road in the depths of the sea for the redeemed to cross over?
11201	12	51	11	51	11	So the redeemed of the LORD will return and enter Zion with singing, crowned with unending joy. Joy and gladness will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee.
11202	12	51	12	51	12	“I, even I, am He who comforts you. Why should you be afraid of mortal man, of a son of man who withers like grass?
11203	12	51	13	51	13	But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You live in terror all day long because of the fury of the oppressor who is bent on destruction. But where is the fury of the oppressor?
11204	12	51	14	51	14	The captive will soon be freed; he will not die in the dungeon, and his bread will not be lacking.
11205	12	51	15	51	15	For I am the LORD your God who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the LORD of Hosts is His name.
11206	12	51	16	51	16	I have put My words in your mouth, and covered you in the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, ‘You are My people.’”
11207	12	51	17	51	17	Awake, awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of His fury; you who have drained the goblet to the dregs—the cup that makes men stagger.
11208	12	51	18	51	18	Among all the sons she bore, there is no one to guide her; among all the sons she brought up, there is no one to take her hand.
11209	12	51	19	51	19	These pairs have befallen you: devastation and destruction, famine and sword. Who will grieve for you? Who can comfort you?
11210	12	51	20	51	20	Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of every street, like an antelope in a net. They are full of the wrath of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
11211	12	51	21	51	21	Therefore now hear this, you afflicted one, drunken, but not with wine.
11212	12	51	22	51	22	Thus says your Lord, the LORD, even your God, who defends His people: “See, I have removed from your hand the cup of staggering. From that goblet, the cup of My fury, you will never drink again.
11213	12	51	23	51	23	I will place it in the hands of your tormentors, who told you: ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’ And you made your back like the ground, like a street to be traversed.”
11214	12	52	1	52	1	Awake, awake, clothe yourself with strength, O Zion! Put on your garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, Holy City! For the uncircumcised and unclean will no longer enter you.
11215	12	52	2	52	2	Shake off your dust! Rise up and sit on your throne, O Jerusalem. Remove the chains from your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.
11216	12	52	3	52	3	For this is what the LORD says: “You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed.”
11217	12	52	4	52	4	For this is what the Lord GOD says: “At first My people went down to Egypt to live, then Assyria oppressed them without cause.
11218	12	52	5	52	5	And now what have I here? declares the LORD. For My people have been taken without cause; those who rule them taunt, declares the LORD, and My name is blasphemed continually all day long.
11219	12	52	6	52	6	Therefore My people will know My name; therefore they will know on that day that I am He who speaks. Here I am!”
11220	12	52	7	52	7	How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!”
11221	12	52	8	52	8	Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices, together they shout for joy. For every eye will see when the LORD returns to Zion.
11222	12	52	9	52	9	Break forth in joy, sing together, O ruins of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.
11223	12	52	10	52	10	The LORD has bared His holy arm in the sight of all the nations; all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
11224	12	52	11	52	11	Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing; come out from it, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
11225	12	52	12	52	12	For you will not leave in a hurry nor flee in haste, for the LORD goes before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard.
11226	12	52	13	52	13	Behold, My Servant will prosper; He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
11227	12	52	14	52	14	Just as many were appalled at Him—His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man, and His form was marred beyond human likeness—
11228	12	52	15	52	15	so He will sprinkle many nations. Kings will shut their mouths because of Him. For they will see what they have not been told, and they will understand what they have not heard.
11229	12	53	1	53	1	Who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
11230	12	53	2	53	2	He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no stately form or majesty to attract us, no beauty that we should desire Him.
11231	12	53	3	53	3	He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.
11232	12	53	4	53	4	Surely He took on our infirmities and carried our sorrows; yet we considered Him stricken by God, struck down and afflicted.
11233	12	53	5	53	5	But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.
11234	12	53	6	53	6	We all like sheep have gone astray, each one has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.
11235	12	53	7	53	7	He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth.
11236	12	53	8	53	8	By oppression and judgment He was taken away, and who can recount His descendants? For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was stricken for the transgression of My people.
11237	12	53	9	53	9	He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.
11238	12	53	10	53	10	Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush Him and to cause Him to suffer; and when His soul is made a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.
11239	12	53	11	53	11	After the anguish of His soul, He will see the light of life and be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant will justify many, and He will bear their iniquities.
11240	12	53	12	53	12	Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the spoils with the strong, because He has poured out His life unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors. Yet He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.
11241	12	54	1	54	1	“Shout for joy, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth into song and cry aloud, you who have never travailed; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband,” says the LORD.
11242	12	54	2	54	2	“Enlarge the site of your tent, stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, do not hold back. Lengthen your ropes and drive your stakes in deep.
11243	12	54	3	54	3	For you will spread out to the right and left; your descendants will dispossess the nations and inhabit the desolate cities.
11244	12	54	4	54	4	Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame; do not be humiliated, for you will not be disgraced. For you will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
11245	12	54	5	54	5	For your husband is your Maker—the LORD of Hosts is His name—the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; He is called the God of all the earth.
11246	12	54	6	54	6	For the LORD has called you back, like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit, the wife of one’s youth when she is rejected,” says your God.
11247	12	54	7	54	7	“For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will bring you back.
11248	12	54	8	54	8	In a surge of anger I hid My face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you,” says the LORD your Redeemer.
11249	12	54	9	54	9	“For to Me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.
11250	12	54	10	54	10	Though the mountains may be removed and the hills may be shaken, My loving devotion will not depart from you, and My covenant of peace will not be broken,” says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
11251	12	54	11	54	11	“O afflicted city, lashed by storms, without solace, surely I will set your stones in antimony and lay your foundations with sapphires.
11252	12	54	12	54	12	I will make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
11253	12	54	13	54	13	Then all your sons will be taught by the LORD, and great will be their prosperity.
11254	12	54	14	54	14	In righteousness you will be established, far from oppression, for you will have no fear. Terror will be far removed, for it will not come near you.
11255	12	54	15	54	15	If anyone attacks you, it is not from Me; whoever assails you will fall before you.
11256	12	54	16	54	16	Behold, I have created the craftsman who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its task; and I have created the destroyer to wreak havoc.
11257	12	54	17	54	17	No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the LORD’s servants, and their vindication is from Me,” declares the LORD.
11258	12	55	1	55	1	“Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you without money, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost!
11259	12	55	2	55	2	Why spend money on that which is not bread, and your labor on that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of foods.
11260	12	55	3	55	3	Incline your ear and come to Me; listen, so that your soul may live. I will make with you an everlasting covenant—My loving devotion assured to David.
11261	12	55	4	55	4	Behold, I have made him a witness to the nations, a leader and commander of the peoples.
11262	12	55	5	55	5	Surely you will summon a nation you do not know, and nations who do not know you will run to you. For the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, has bestowed glory on you.”
11263	12	55	6	55	6	Seek the LORD while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.
11264	12	55	7	55	7	Let the wicked man forsake his own way and the unrighteous man his own thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that He may have compassion, and to our God, for He will freely pardon.
11265	12	55	8	55	8	“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares the LORD.
11266	12	55	9	55	9	“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so My ways are higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.
11267	12	55	10	55	10	For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return without watering the earth, making it bud and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,
11268	12	55	11	55	11	so My word that proceeds from My mouth will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please, and it will prosper where I send it.
11269	12	55	12	55	12	You will indeed go out with joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
11270	12	55	13	55	13	Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will grow, and instead of the brier, a myrtle will spring up; they will make a name for the LORD, an everlasting sign, never to be destroyed.”
11271	12	56	1	56	1	This is what the LORD says: “Maintain justice and do what is right, for My salvation is coming soon, and My righteousness will be revealed.
11272	12	56	2	56	2	Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
11273	12	56	3	56	3	Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, “The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.” And let the eunuch not say, “I am but a dry tree.”
11274	12	56	4	56	4	For this is what the LORD says: “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, who choose what pleases Me and hold fast to My covenant—
11275	12	56	5	56	5	I will give them, in My house and within My walls, a memorial and a name better than that of sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
11276	12	56	6	56	6	And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD to minister to Him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be His servants—all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it and who hold fast to My covenant—
11277	12	56	7	56	7	I will bring them to My holy mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.”
11278	12	56	8	56	8	Thus declares the Lord GOD, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: “I will gather to them still others besides those already gathered.”
11279	12	56	9	56	9	Come, all you beasts of the field; eat greedily, all you beasts of the forest.
11280	12	56	10	56	10	Israel’s watchmen are blind, they are all oblivious; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they are dreamers lying around, loving to slumber.
11281	12	56	11	56	11	Like ravenous dogs, they are never satisfied. They are shepherds with no discernment; they all turn to their own way, each one seeking his own gain:
11282	12	56	12	56	12	“Come, let me get the wine, let us imbibe the strong drink, and tomorrow will be like today, only far better!”
11283	12	57	1	57	1	The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; devout men are swept away, while no one considers that the righteous are guided from the presence of evil.
11284	12	57	2	57	2	Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest, lying down in death.
11285	12	57	3	57	3	“But come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
11286	12	57	4	57	4	Whom are you mocking? At whom do you snarl and stick out your tongue? Are you not children of transgression, offspring of deceit,
11287	12	57	5	57	5	who burn with lust among the oaks, under every luxuriant tree, who slaughter your children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
11288	12	57	6	57	6	Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; indeed, they are your lot. Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering. Should I relent because of these?
11289	12	57	7	57	7	On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, and there you went up to offer sacrifices.
11290	12	57	8	57	8	Behind the door and doorpost you have set up your memorial. Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; you climbed up and opened it wide. And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; you have gazed upon their nakedness.
11291	12	57	9	57	9	You went to Molech with oil and multiplied your perfumes. You have sent your envoys a great distance; you have descended even to Sheol itself.
11292	12	57	10	57	10	You are wearied by your many journeys, but you did not say, “There is no hope!” You found renewal of your strength; therefore you did not grow weak.
11293	12	57	11	57	11	Whom have you dreaded and feared, so that you lied and failed to remember Me or take this to heart? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear Me?
11294	12	57	12	57	12	I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not profit you.
11295	12	57	13	57	13	When you cry out, let your companies of idols deliver you! Yet the wind will carry off all of them, a breath will take them away. But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land and possess My holy mountain.”
11296	12	57	14	57	14	And it will be said, “Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”
11297	12	57	15	57	15	For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and humble of spirit, to restore the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the contrite.
11298	12	57	16	57	16	For I will not accuse you forever, nor will I always be angry; for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me, with the breath of those I have made.
11299	12	57	17	57	17	I was enraged by his sinful greed, so I struck him and hid My face in anger; yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart.
11300	12	57	18	57	18	I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,
11301	12	57	19	57	19	bringing praise to their lips. Peace, peace to those far and near,” says the LORD, “and I will heal them.”
11302	12	57	20	57	20	But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, for it cannot be still, and its waves churn up mire and muck.
11303	12	57	21	57	21	“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
11304	12	58	1	58	1	“Cry aloud, do not hold back! Raise your voice like a ram’s horn. Declare to My people their transgression and to the house of Jacob their sins.
11305	12	58	2	58	2	For day after day they seek Me and delight to know My ways, like a nation that does what is right and does not forsake the justice of their God. They ask Me for righteous judgments; they delight in the nearness of God.”
11306	12	58	3	58	3	“Why have we fasted, and You have not seen? Why have we humbled ourselves, and You have not noticed?” “Behold, on the day of your fast, you do as you please, and you oppress all your workers.
11307	12	58	4	58	4	You fast with contention and strife to strike viciously with your fist. You cannot fast as you do today and have your voice be heard on high.
11308	12	58	5	58	5	Is this the fast I have chosen, a day for a man to deny himself, to bow his head like a reed, and to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the LORD?
11309	12	58	6	58	6	Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen: to break the chains of wickedness, to untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and tear off every yoke?
11310	12	58	7	58	7	Isn’t it to share your bread with the hungry, to bring the poor and homeless into your home, to clothe the naked when you see him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
11311	12	58	8	58	8	Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will come quickly. Your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
11312	12	58	9	58	9	Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry out, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and malicious talk,
11313	12	58	10	58	10	and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light will go forth in the darkness, and your night will be like noonday.
11314	12	58	11	58	11	The LORD will always guide you; He will satisfy you in a sun-scorched land and strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.
11315	12	58	12	58	12	Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will restore the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of the Breach, Restorer of the Streets of Dwelling.
11316	12	58	13	58	13	If you turn your foot from breaking the Sabbath, from doing as you please on My holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight, and the LORD’s holy day honorable, if you honor it by not going your own way or seeking your own pleasure or speaking idle words,
11317	12	58	14	58	14	then you will delight yourself in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the heights of the land and feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
11318	12	59	1	59	1	Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor His ear too dull to hear.
11319	12	59	2	59	2	But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear.
11320	12	59	3	59	3	For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters injustice.
11321	12	59	4	59	4	No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case honestly. They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies; they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
11322	12	59	5	59	5	They hatch the eggs of vipers and weave a spider’s web. Whoever eats their eggs will die; crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
11323	12	59	6	59	6	Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their deeds are sinful deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.
11324	12	59	7	59	7	Their feet run to evil; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; ruin and destruction lie in their wake.
11325	12	59	8	59	8	The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have turned them into crooked paths; no one who treads on them will know peace.
11326	12	59	9	59	9	Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
11327	12	59	10	59	10	Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall, groping like those without eyes. We stumble at midday as in the twilight; among the vigorous we are like the dead.
11328	12	59	11	59	11	We all growl like bears and moan like doves. We hope for justice, but find none, for salvation, but it is far from us.
11329	12	59	12	59	12	For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. Our transgressions are indeed with us, and we know our iniquities:
11330	12	59	13	59	13	rebelling and denying the LORD, turning away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering lies from the heart.
11331	12	59	14	59	14	So justice is turned away, and righteousness stands at a distance. For truth has stumbled in the public square, and honesty cannot enter.
11332	12	59	15	59	15	Truth is missing, and whoever turns from evil becomes prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
11333	12	59	16	59	16	He saw that there was no man; He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. So His own arm brought salvation, and His own righteousness sustained Him.
11334	12	59	17	59	17	He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
11335	12	59	18	59	18	So He will repay according to their deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and recompense to the islands.
11336	12	59	19	59	19	So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west and His glory from the rising of the sun. For He will come like a raging flood, driven by the breath of the LORD.
11337	12	59	20	59	20	“The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,” declares the LORD.
11338	12	59	21	59	21	“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit who is upon you, and My words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth, from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of your children’s children, from now on and forevermore,” says the LORD.
11339	12	60	1	60	1	Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.
11340	12	60	2	60	2	For behold, darkness covers the earth, and thick darkness is over the peoples; but the LORD will rise upon you, and His glory will appear over you.
11341	12	60	3	60	3	Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
11342	12	60	4	60	4	Lift up your eyes and look around: They all gather and come to you; your sons will come from afar, and your daughters will be carried on the arm.
11343	12	60	5	60	5	Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart will tremble and swell with joy, because the riches of the sea will be brought to you, and the wealth of the nations will come to you.
11344	12	60	6	60	6	Caravans of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah, and all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and frankincense and proclaiming the praises of the LORD.
11345	12	60	7	60	7	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you; the rams of Nebaioth will serve you and go up on My altar with acceptance; I will adorn My glorious house.
11346	12	60	8	60	8	Who are these who fly like clouds, like doves to their shelters?
11347	12	60	9	60	9	Surely the islands will wait for Me, with the ships of Tarshish in the lead, to bring your children from afar, with their silver and gold, to the honor of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you.
11348	12	60	10	60	10	Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. Although I struck you in anger, yet in favor I will show you mercy.
11349	12	60	11	60	11	Your gates will always stand open; they will never be shut, day or night, so that the wealth of the nations may be brought into you, with their kings being led in procession.
11350	12	60	12	60	12	For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; it will be utterly destroyed.
11351	12	60	13	60	13	The glory of Lebanon will come to you—its cypress, elm, and boxwood together—to adorn the place of My sanctuary, and I will glorify the place of My feet.
11352	12	60	14	60	14	The sons of your oppressors will come and bow down to you; all who reviled you will fall facedown at your feet and call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
11353	12	60	15	60	15	Whereas you have been forsaken and despised, with no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, a joy from age to age.
11354	12	60	16	60	16	You will drink the milk of nations and nurse at the breasts of royalty; you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
11355	12	60	17	60	17	Instead of bronze I will bring you gold; I will bring silver in place of iron, bronze instead of wood, and iron instead of stones. I will appoint peace as your governor and righteousness as your ruler.
11356	12	60	18	60	18	No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders. But you will name your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.
11357	12	60	19	60	19	No longer will the sun be your light by day, nor the brightness of the moon shine on your night; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor.
11358	12	60	20	60	20	Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not wane; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will cease.
11359	12	60	21	60	21	Then all your people will be righteous; they will possess the land forever; they are the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.
11360	12	60	22	60	22	The least of you will become a thousand, and the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; in its time I will accomplish it quickly.
11361	12	61	1	61	1	The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners,
11362	12	61	2	61	2	to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor and the day of our God’s vengeance, to comfort all who mourn,
11363	12	61	3	61	3	to console the mourners in Zion—to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
11364	12	61	4	61	4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.
11365	12	61	5	61	5	Strangers will stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
11366	12	61	6	61	6	But you will be called the priests of the LORD; they will speak of you as ministers of our God; you will feed on the wealth of nations, and you will boast in their riches.
11367	12	61	7	61	7	Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion, and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their share; and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.
11368	12	61	8	61	8	For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and iniquity; in My faithfulness I will give them their recompense and make an everlasting covenant with them.
11369	12	61	9	61	9	Their descendants will be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the LORD has blessed.
11370	12	61	10	61	10	I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, my soul will exult in my God; for He has clothed me with garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a groom wears a priestly headdress, as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
11371	12	61	11	61	11	For as the earth brings forth its growth, and as a garden enables seed to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.
11372	12	62	1	62	1	For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still, until her righteousness shines like a bright light, her salvation like a blazing torch.
11373	12	62	2	62	2	Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.
11374	12	62	3	62	3	You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, a royal diadem in the palm of your God.
11375	12	62	4	62	4	No longer will you be called Forsaken, nor your land named Desolate; but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be His bride.
11376	12	62	5	62	5	For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a groom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.
11377	12	62	6	62	6	On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD shall take no rest for yourselves,
11378	12	62	7	62	7	nor give Him any rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
11379	12	62	8	62	8	The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain to your enemies for food, nor will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled.
11380	12	62	9	62	9	For those who harvest grain will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather grapes will drink the wine in My holy courts.”
11381	12	62	10	62	10	Go out, go out through the gates; prepare the way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones! Raise a banner for the nations.
11382	12	62	11	62	11	Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, “Say to Daughter Zion: See, your Savior comes! Look, His reward is with Him, and His recompense goes before Him.”
11383	12	62	12	62	12	And they will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of The LORD; and you will be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
11384	12	63	1	63	1	Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah with crimson-stained garments? Who is this robed in splendor, marching in the greatness of His strength? “It is I, proclaiming vindication, mighty to save.”
11385	12	63	2	63	2	Why are Your clothes red, and Your garments like one who treads the winepress?
11386	12	63	3	63	3	“I have trodden the winepress alone, and no one from the nations was with Me. I trampled them in My anger and trod them down in My fury; their blood spattered My garments, and all My clothes were stained.
11387	12	63	4	63	4	For the day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redemption had come.
11388	12	63	5	63	5	I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled that no one assisted. So My arm brought Me salvation, and My own wrath upheld Me.
11389	12	63	6	63	6	I trampled the nations in My anger; in My wrath I made them drunk and poured out their blood on the ground.”
11390	12	63	7	63	7	I will make known the LORD’s loving devotion and His praiseworthy acts, because of all that the LORD has done for us—the many good things for the house of Israel according to His great compassion and loving devotion.
11391	12	63	8	63	8	For He said, “They are surely My people, sons who will not be disloyal.” So He became their Savior.
11392	12	63	9	63	9	In all their distress, He too was afflicted, and the angel of His Presence saved them. In His love and compassion He redeemed them; He lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
11393	12	63	10	63	10	But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit. So He turned and became their enemy, and He Himself fought against them.
11394	12	63	11	63	11	Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses. Where is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is the One who set His Holy Spirit among them,
11395	12	63	12	63	12	who sent His glorious arm to lead them by the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them to gain for Himself everlasting renown,
11396	12	63	13	63	13	who led them through the depths like a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?
11397	12	63	14	63	14	Like cattle going down to the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. You led Your people this way to make for Yourself a glorious name.
11398	12	63	15	63	15	Look down from heaven and see, from Your holy and glorious habitation. Where are Your zeal and might? Your yearning and compassion for me are restrained.
11399	12	63	16	63	16	Yet You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O LORD, are our Father; our Redeemer from Everlasting is Your name.
11400	12	63	17	63	17	Why, O LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways and harden our hearts from fearing You? Return, for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your heritage.
11401	12	63	18	63	18,19	For a short while Your people possessed Your holy place, but our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary. We have become like those You never ruled, like those not called by Your name.
11402	12	63	19	64	1	If only You would rend the heavens and come down, so that mountains would quake at Your presence,
11403	12	64	1	64	2	as fire kindles the brushwood and causes the water to boil, to make Your name known to Your enemies, so that the nations will tremble at Your presence!
11404	12	64	2	64	3	When You did awesome works that we did not expect, You came down, and the mountains trembled at Your presence.
11405	12	64	3	64	4	From ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides You, who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him.
11406	12	64	4	64	5	You welcome those who gladly do right, who remember Your ways. Surely You were angry, for we sinned. How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?
11407	12	64	5	64	6	Each of us has become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.
11408	12	64	6	64	7	No one calls on Your name or strives to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us and delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.
11409	12	64	7	64	8	But now, O LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the potter; we are all the work of Your hand.
11410	12	64	8	64	9	Do not be angry, O LORD, beyond measure; do not remember our iniquity forever. Oh, look upon us, we pray; we are all Your people!
11411	12	64	9	64	10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wasteland and Jerusalem a desolation.
11412	12	64	10	64	11	Our holy and beautiful temple, where our fathers praised You, has been burned with fire, and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.
11413	12	64	11	64	12	After all this, O LORD, will You restrain Yourself? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
11414	12	65	1	65	1	“I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me; I was found by those who did not seek Me. To a nation that did not call My name, I said, ‘Here I am! Here I am!’
11415	12	65	2	65	2	All day long I have held out My hands to an obstinate people who walk in the wrong path, who follow their own imaginations,
11416	12	65	3	65	3	to a people who continually provoke Me to My face, sacrificing in the gardens and burning incense on altars of brick,
11417	12	65	4	65	4	sitting among the graves, spending nights in secret places, eating the meat of pigs and polluted broth from their bowls.
11418	12	65	5	65	5	They say, ‘Keep to yourself; do not come near me, for I am holier than you!’ Such people are smoke in My nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.
11419	12	65	6	65	6	Behold, it is written before Me: I will not keep silent, but I will repay; I will pay it back into their laps,
11420	12	65	7	65	7	both for your iniquities and those of your fathers,” says the LORD. “Because they burned incense on the mountains and scorned Me on the hills, I will measure into their laps full payment for their former deeds.”
11421	12	65	8	65	8	This is what the LORD says: “As the new wine is found in a cluster of grapes, and men say, ‘Do not destroy it, for it contains a blessing,’ so I will act on behalf of My servants; I will not destroy them all.
11422	12	65	9	65	9	And I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and heirs from Judah; My elect will possess My mountains, and My servants will dwell there.
11423	12	65	10	65	10	Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for My people who seek Me.
11424	12	65	11	65	11	But you who forsake the LORD, who forget My holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
11425	12	65	12	65	12	I will destine you for the sword, and you will all kneel down to be slaughtered, because I called and you did not answer, I spoke and you did not listen; you did evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.”
11426	12	65	13	65	13	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
11427	12	65	14	65	14	My servants will shout for joy with a glad heart, but you will cry out with a heavy heart and wail with a broken spirit.
11428	12	65	15	65	15	You will leave behind your name as a curse for My chosen ones, and the Lord GOD will slay you, but to His servants He will give another name.
11429	12	65	16	65	16	Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth, and whoever takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the former troubles will be forgotten and hidden from My sight.
11430	12	65	17	65	17	For behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
11431	12	65	18	65	18	But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy and its people to be a delight.
11432	12	65	19	65	19	I will rejoice in Jerusalem and take delight in My people. The sounds of weeping and crying will no longer be heard in her.
11433	12	65	20	65	20	No longer will a nursing infant live but a few days, or an old man not live out his years. For the youth will die at a hundred years, and he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
11434	12	65	21	65	21	They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
11435	12	65	22	65	22	No longer will they build houses for others to inhabit, nor plant for others to eat. For as is the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people, and My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.
11436	12	65	23	65	23	They will not labor in vain or bear children doomed to disaster; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD—they and their descendants with them.
11437	12	65	24	65	24	Even before they call, I will answer, and while they are still speaking, I will hear.
11438	12	65	25	65	25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but the food of the serpent will be dust. They will do no harm nor destruction on all My holy mountain,” says the LORD.
11439	12	66	1	66	1	This is what the LORD says: “Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? Or where will My place of repose be?
11440	12	66	2	66	2	Has not My hand made all these things? And so they came into being,” declares the LORD. “This is the one I will esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, who trembles at My word.
11441	12	66	3	66	3	Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who slays a man; whoever sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever presents a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood; whoever offers frankincense is like one who praises an idol. Indeed, they have chosen their own ways and delighted in their abominations.
11442	12	66	4	66	4	So I will choose their punishment and I will bring terror upon them, because I called and no one answered, I spoke and no one listened. But they did what was evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.”
11443	12	66	5	66	5	You who tremble at His word, hear the word of the LORD: “Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of My name have said, ‘Let the LORD be glorified that we may see your joy!’ But they will be put to shame.”
11444	12	66	6	66	6	Hear the uproar from the city; listen to the voice from the temple! It is the voice of the LORD, repaying His enemies what they deserve!
11445	12	66	7	66	7	“Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before she was in pain, she delivered a boy.
11446	12	66	8	66	8	Who has heard of such as this? Who has seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be delivered in an instant? Yet as soon as Zion was in labor, she gave birth to her children.
11447	12	66	9	66	9	Shall I bring a baby to the point of birth and not deliver it?” says the LORD. “Or will I who deliver close the womb?” says your God.
11448	12	66	10	66	10	Be glad for Jerusalem and rejoice over her, all who love her. Rejoice greatly with her, all who mourn over her,
11449	12	66	11	66	11	so that you may nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you may drink deeply and delight yourselves in her glorious abundance.
11450	12	66	12	66	12	For this is what the LORD says: “I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flowing stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm, and bounced upon her knees.
11451	12	66	13	66	13	As a mother comforts her son, so will I comfort you, and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.”
11452	12	66	14	66	14	When you see, you will rejoice, and you will flourish like grass; then the hand of the LORD will be revealed to His servants, but His wrath will be shown to His enemies.
11453	12	66	15	66	15	For behold, the LORD will come with fire—His chariots are like a whirlwind—to execute His anger with fury and His rebuke with flames of fire.
11454	12	66	16	66	16	For by fire and by His sword, the LORD will execute judgment on all flesh, and many will be slain by the LORD.
11455	12	66	17	66	17	“Those who consecrate and purify themselves to enter the groves—to follow one in the center of those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats—will perish together,” declares the LORD.
11456	12	66	18	66	18	“And I, knowing their deeds and thoughts, am coming to gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see My glory.
11457	12	66	19	66	19	I will establish a sign among them, and I will send survivors from among them to the nations—to Tarshish, Put, and the archers of Lud; to Tubal, Javan, and the islands far away who have not heard of My fame or seen My glory. So they will proclaim My glory among the nations.
11458	12	66	20	66	20	And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a gift to the LORD on horses and chariots and wagons, on mules and camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says the LORD, “just as the Israelites bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.”
11459	12	66	21	66	21	“And I will select some of them as priests and Levites,” says the LORD.
11460	12	66	22	66	22	“For just as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will endure before Me,” declares the LORD, “so your descendants and your name will endure.
11461	12	66	23	66	23	From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come to worship before Me,” says the LORD.
11462	12	66	24	66	24	“As they go forth, they will see the corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me; for their worm will never die, their fire will never be quenched, and they will be a horror to all mankind.”
11463	13	1	1	1	1	These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
11464	13	1	2	1	2	The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah,
11465	13	1	3	1	3	and through the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
11466	13	1	4	1	4	The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
11467	13	1	5	1	5	“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
11468	13	1	6	1	6	“Ah, Lord GOD,” I said, “I surely do not know how to speak, for I am only a child!”
11469	13	1	7	1	7	But the LORD told me: “Do not say, ‘I am only a child.’ For to everyone I send you, you must go, and all that I command you, you must speak.
11470	13	1	8	1	8	Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,” declares the LORD.
11471	13	1	9	1	9	Then the LORD reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and said to me: “Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.
11472	13	1	10	1	10	See, I have appointed you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant.”
11473	13	1	11	1	11	And the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” “I see a branch of an almond tree,” I replied.
11474	13	1	12	1	12	“You have observed correctly,” said the LORD, “for I am watching over My word to accomplish it.”
11475	13	1	13	1	13	Again the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “What do you see?” “I see a boiling pot,” I replied, “and it is tilting toward us from the north.”
11476	13	1	14	1	14	Then the LORD said to me, “Disaster from the north will be poured out on all who live in the land.
11477	13	1	15	1	15	For I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north,” declares the LORD. “Their kings will come and set up their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem. They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah.
11478	13	1	16	1	16	I will pronounce My judgments against them for all their wickedness, because they have forsaken Me to burn incense to other gods and to worship the works of their own hands.
11479	13	1	17	1	17	Get yourself ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them, or I will terrify you before them.
11480	13	1	18	1	18	Now behold, this day I have made you like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
11481	13	1	19	1	19	They will fight against you but will never overcome you, since I am with you to deliver you,” declares the LORD.
11482	13	2	1	2	1	Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
11483	13	2	2	2	2	“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
11484	13	2	3	2	3	Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of His harvest. All who devoured her found themselves guilty; disaster came upon them,’” declares the LORD.
11485	13	2	4	2	4	Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all you families of the house of Israel.
11486	13	2	5	2	5	This is what the LORD says: “What fault did your fathers find in Me that they strayed so far from Me, and followed worthless idols, and became worthless themselves?
11487	13	2	6	2	6	They did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD who brought us from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, a land of drought and darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’
11488	13	2	7	2	7	I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and bounty, but you came and defiled My land, and made My inheritance detestable.
11489	13	2	8	2	8	The priests did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD?’ The experts in the law no longer knew Me, and the leaders rebelled against Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and followed useless idols.
11490	13	2	9	2	9	Therefore, I will contend with you again, declares the LORD, and I will bring a case against your children’s children.
11491	13	2	10	2	10	Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus and take a look; send to Kedar and consider carefully; see if there has ever been anything like this:
11492	13	2	11	2	11	Has a nation ever changed its gods? (though they were no gods at all!) Yet My people have exchanged their Glory for useless idols.
11493	13	2	12	2	12	Be stunned by this, O heavens; be shocked and utterly appalled,” declares the LORD.
11494	13	2	13	2	13	“For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water, and they have dug their own cisterns—broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
11495	13	2	14	2	14	Is Israel a slave? Was he born into slavery? Why then has he become prey?
11496	13	2	15	2	15	The young lions have roared at him; they have growled with a loud voice. They have laid waste his land; his cities lie in ruins, without inhabitants.
11497	13	2	16	2	16	The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.
11498	13	2	17	2	17	Have you not brought this on yourself by forsaking the LORD your God when He led you in the way?
11499	13	2	18	2	18	Now what will you gain on your way to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? What will you gain on your way to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
11500	13	2	19	2	19	Your own evil will discipline you; your own apostasies will reprimand you. Consider and realize how evil and bitter it is for you to forsake the LORD your God and to have no fear of Me,” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
11501	13	2	20	2	20	“For long ago you broke your yoke and tore off your chains, saying, ‘I will not serve!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down as a prostitute.
11502	13	2	21	2	21	I had planted you like a choice vine from the very best seed. How could you turn yourself before Me, into a rotten wild vine?
11503	13	2	22	2	22	Although you wash with lye and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt is still before Me,” declares the Lord GOD.
11504	13	2	23	2	23	“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals’? Look at your behavior in the valley; acknowledge what you have done. You are a swift young she-camel galloping here and there,
11505	13	2	24	2	24	a wild donkey at home in the wilderness, sniffing the wind in the heat of her desire. Who can restrain her passion? All who seek her need not weary themselves; in mating season they will find her.
11506	13	2	25	2	25	You should have kept your feet from going bare and your throat from being thirsty. But you said, ‘It is hopeless! For I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.’
11507	13	2	26	2	26	As the thief is ashamed when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets
11508	13	2	27	2	27	say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’ and to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ For they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces, yet in the time of trouble they beg, ‘Rise up and save us!’
11509	13	2	28	2	28	But where are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them rise up in your time of trouble and save you if they can; for your gods are as numerous as your cities, O Judah.
11510	13	2	29	2	29	Why do you bring a case against Me? You have all rebelled against Me,” declares the LORD.
11511	13	2	30	2	30	“I have struck your sons in vain; they accepted no discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a voracious lion.”
11512	13	2	31	2	31	You people of this generation, consider the word of the LORD: “Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of dense darkness? Why do My people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will come to You no more’?
11513	13	2	32	2	32	Does a maiden forget her jewelry or a bride her wedding sash? Yet My people have forgotten Me for days without number.
11514	13	2	33	2	33	How skillfully you pursue love; even the most immoral of women could learn from your ways.
11515	13	2	34	2	34	Moreover, your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor, though you did not find them breaking in. But in spite of all these things
11516	13	2	35	2	35	you say, ‘I am innocent. Surely His anger will turn from me.’ Behold, I will judge you, because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
11517	13	2	36	2	36	How unstable you are, constantly changing your ways! You will be disappointed by Egypt just as you were by Assyria.
11518	13	2	37	2	37	Moreover, you will leave that place with your hands on your head, for the LORD has rejected those you trust; you will not prosper by their help.”
11519	13	3	1	3	1	“If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to marry another, can he ever return to her? Would not such a land be completely defiled? But you have played the harlot with many lovers—and you would return to Me?” declares the LORD.
11520	13	3	2	3	2	“Lift up your eyes to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been violated? You sat beside the highways waiting for your lovers, like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
11521	13	3	3	3	3	Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen. Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute; you refuse to be ashamed.
11522	13	3	4	3	4	Have you not just called to Me, ‘My Father, You are my friend from youth.
11523	13	3	5	3	5	Will He be angry forever? Will He be indignant to the end?’ This you have spoken, but you keep doing all the evil you can.”
11524	13	3	6	3	6	Now in the days of King Josiah, the LORD said to me, “Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every green tree to prostitute herself there.
11525	13	3	7	3	7	I thought that after she had done all these things, she would return to Me. But she did not return, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.
11526	13	3	8	3	8	She saw that because faithless Israel had committed adultery, I gave her a certificate of divorce and sent her away. Yet that unfaithful sister Judah had no fear and prostituted herself as well.
11527	13	3	9	3	9	Indifferent to her own infidelity, Israel had defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
11528	13	3	10	3	10	Yet in spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the LORD.
11529	13	3	11	3	11	And the LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than unfaithful Judah.
11530	13	3	12	3	12	Go, proclaim this message toward the north: ‘Return, O faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD. ‘I will no longer look on you with anger, for I am merciful,’ declares the LORD. ‘I will not be angry forever.
11531	13	3	13	3	13	Only acknowledge your guilt, that you have rebelled against the LORD your God. You have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every green tree and have not obeyed My voice,’” declares the LORD.
11532	13	3	14	3	14	“Return, O faithless children,” declares the LORD, “for I am your master, and I will take you—one from a city and two from a family—and bring you to Zion.
11533	13	3	15	3	15	Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.”
11534	13	3	16	3	16	“In those days, when you multiply and increase in the land,” declares the LORD, “no longer will they say, ‘The ark of the LORD’s covenant.’ It will never come to mind, and no one will remember it or miss it, nor will another one be made.
11535	13	3	17	3	17	At that time Jerusalem will be called The Throne of the LORD, and all the nations will be gathered in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. They will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
11536	13	3	18	3	18	In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave to your fathers as an inheritance.
11537	13	3	19	3	19	Then I said, ‘How I long to make you My sons and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations.’ I thought you would call Me ‘Father’ and never turn away from following Me.
11538	13	3	20	3	20	But as a woman may betray her husband, so you have betrayed Me, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD.
11539	13	3	21	3	21	A voice is heard on the barren heights, the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy, because they have perverted their ways and forgotten the LORD their God.
11540	13	3	22	3	22	“Return, O faithless children, and I will heal your faithlessness.” “Here we are. We come to You, for You are the LORD our God.
11541	13	3	23	3	23	Surely deception comes from the hills, and commotion from the mountains. Surely the salvation of Israel is in the LORD our God.
11542	13	3	24	3	24	From our youth, that shameful god has consumed what our fathers have worked for—their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters.
11543	13	3	25	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame; let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the LORD our God, both we and our fathers; from our youth even to this day we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”
11544	13	4	1	4	1	“If you will return, O Israel, return to Me,” declares the LORD. “If you will remove your detestable idols from My sight and no longer waver,
11545	13	4	2	4	2	and if you can swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will be blessed by Him, and in Him they will glory.”
11546	13	4	3	4	3	For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: “Break up your unplowed ground, and do not sow among the thorns.
11547	13	4	4	4	4	Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and remove the foreskins of your hearts, O men of Judah and people of Jerusalem. Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it, because of your evil deeds.”
11548	13	4	5	4	5	Announce in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: “Blow the ram’s horn throughout the land. Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves and let us flee to the fortified cities.’
11549	13	4	6	4	6	Raise a signal flag toward Zion. Seek refuge! Do not delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, and terrible destruction.
11550	13	4	7	4	7	A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his lair to lay waste your land. Your cities will be reduced to ruins and lie uninhabited.
11551	13	4	8	4	8	So put on sackcloth, mourn and wail, for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from us.”
11552	13	4	9	4	9	“In that day,” declares the LORD, “the king and officials will lose their courage. The priests will tremble in fear, and the prophets will be astounded.”
11553	13	4	10	4	10	Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, how completely You have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ while a sword is at our throats.”
11554	13	4	11	4	11	At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A searing wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward the daughter of My people, but not to winnow or to sift;
11555	13	4	12	4	12	a wind too strong for that comes from Me. Now I also pronounce judgments against them.”
11556	13	4	13	4	13	Behold, he advances like the clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!
11557	13	4	14	4	14	Wash the evil from your heart, O Jerusalem, so that you may be saved. How long will you harbor wicked thoughts within you?
11558	13	4	15	4	15	For a voice resounds from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.
11559	13	4	16	4	16	Warn the nations now! Proclaim to Jerusalem: “A besieging army comes from a distant land; they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
11560	13	4	17	4	17	They surround her like men guarding a field, because she has rebelled against Me,” declares the LORD.
11561	13	4	18	4	18	“Your ways and your deeds have brought this upon you. This is your punishment; how bitter it is, because it pierces to the heart!”
11562	13	4	19	4	19	My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the pain in my chest! My heart pounds within me; I cannot be silent. For I have heard the sound of the horn, the alarm of battle.
11563	13	4	20	4	20	Disaster after disaster is proclaimed, for the whole land is laid waste. My tents are destroyed in an instant, my curtains in a moment.
11564	13	4	21	4	21	How long must I see the signal flag and hear the sound of the horn?
11565	13	4	22	4	22	“For My people are fools; they have not known Me. They are foolish children, without understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but they know not how to do good.”
11566	13	4	23	4	23	I looked at the earth, and it was formless and void; I looked to the heavens, and they had no light.
11567	13	4	24	4	24	I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.
11568	13	4	25	4	25	I looked, and no man was left; all the birds of the air had fled.
11569	13	4	26	4	26	I looked, and the fertile field was a desert. All its cities were torn down before the LORD, before His fierce anger.
11570	13	4	27	4	27	For this is what the LORD says: “The whole land will be desolate, but I will not finish its destruction.
11571	13	4	28	4	28	Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above will grow dark. I have spoken, I have planned, and I will not relent or turn back.”
11572	13	4	29	4	29	Every city flees at the sound of the horseman and archer. They enter the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every city is abandoned; no inhabitant is left.
11573	13	4	30	4	30	And you, O devastated one, what will you do, though you dress yourself in scarlet, though you adorn yourself with gold jewelry, though you enlarge your eyes with paint? You adorn yourself in vain; your lovers despise you; they want to take your life.
11574	13	4	31	4	31	For I hear a cry like a woman in labor, a cry of anguish like one bearing her first child—the cry of the Daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands to say, “Woe is me, for my soul faints before the murderers!”
11575	13	5	1	5	1	“Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem. Look now and take note; search her squares. If you can find a single person, anyone who acts justly, anyone who seeks the truth, then I will forgive the city.
11576	13	5	2	5	2	Although they say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’ they are swearing falsely.”
11577	13	5	3	5	3	O LORD, do not Your eyes look for truth? You struck them, but they felt no pain. You finished them off, but they refused to accept discipline. They have made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent.
11578	13	5	4	5	4	Then I said, “They are only the poor; they have played the fool, for they do not know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.
11579	13	5	5	5	5	I will go to the powerful and speak to them. Surely they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.” But they too, with one accord, had broken the yoke and torn off the chains.
11580	13	5	6	5	6	Therefore a lion from the forest will strike them down, a wolf from the desert will ravage them. A leopard will lie in wait near their cities, and everyone who ventures out will be torn to pieces. For their rebellious acts are many, and their unfaithful deeds are numerous.
11581	13	5	7	5	7	“Why should I forgive you? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by gods that are not gods. I satisfied their needs, yet they committed adultery and assembled at the houses of prostitutes.
11582	13	5	8	5	8	They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing after his neighbor’s wife.
11583	13	5	9	5	9	Should I not punish them for these things?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
11584	13	5	10	5	10	Go up through her vineyards and ravage them, but do not finish them off. Strip off her branches, for they do not belong to the LORD.
11585	13	5	11	5	11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to Me,” declares the LORD.
11586	13	5	12	5	12	They have lied about the LORD and said: “He will not do anything; harm will not come to us; we will not see sword or famine.
11587	13	5	13	5	13	The prophets are but wind, for the LORD’s word is not in them. So let their own predictions befall them.”
11588	13	5	14	5	14	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Because you have spoken this word, I will make My words a fire in your mouth and this people the wood it consumes.
11589	13	5	15	5	15	Behold, I am bringing a distant nation against you, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD. “It is an established nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know and whose speech you do not understand.
11590	13	5	16	5	16	Their quivers are like open graves; they are all mighty men.
11591	13	5	17	5	17	They will devour your harvest and food; they will consume your sons and daughters; they will eat up your flocks and herds; they will feed on your vines and fig trees. With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust.”
11592	13	5	18	5	18	“Yet even in those days,” declares the LORD, “I will not make a full end of you.
11593	13	5	19	5	19	And when the people ask, ‘For what offense has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’ You are to tell them, ‘Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve foreigners in a land that is not your own.’”
11594	13	5	20	5	20	Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:
11595	13	5	21	5	21	“Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear.
11596	13	5	22	5	22	Do you not fear Me?” declares the LORD. “Do you not tremble before Me, the One who set the sand as the boundary for the sea, an enduring barrier it cannot cross? The waves surge, but they cannot prevail. They roar but cannot cross it.
11597	13	5	23	5	23	But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned aside and gone away.
11598	13	5	24	5	24	They have not said in their hearts, ‘Let us fear the LORD our God, who gives the rains, both autumn and spring, in season, who keeps for us the appointed weeks of harvest.’
11599	13	5	25	5	25	Your iniquities have diverted these from you; your sins have deprived you of My bounty.
11600	13	5	26	5	26	For among My people are wicked men; they watch like fowlers lying in wait; they set a trap to catch men.
11601	13	5	27	5	27	Like cages full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. Therefore they have become powerful and rich.
11602	13	5	28	5	28	They have grown fat and sleek, and have excelled in evil matters. They have not taken up the cause of the fatherless, that they might prosper; nor have they defended the rights of the needy.
11603	13	5	29	5	29	Should I not punish them for these things?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
11604	13	5	30	5	30	A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land.
11605	13	5	31	5	31	The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority. My people love it so, but what will you do in the end?”
11606	13	6	1	6	1	“Run for cover, O sons of Benjamin; flee from Jerusalem! Sound the ram’s horn in Tekoa; send up a signal over Beth-haccherem, for disaster looms from the north, even great destruction.
11607	13	6	2	6	2	Though she is beautiful and delicate, I will destroy the Daughter of Zion.
11608	13	6	3	6	3	Shepherds and their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents all around her, each tending his own portion:
11609	13	6	4	6	4	‘Prepare for battle against her; rise up, let us attack at noon. Woe to us, for the daylight is fading; the evening shadows grow long.
11610	13	6	5	6	5	Rise up, let us attack by night and destroy her fortresses!’”
11611	13	6	6	6	6	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Cut down the trees and raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; there is nothing but oppression in her midst.
11612	13	6	7	6	7	As a well gushes its water, so she pours out her evil. Violence and destruction resound in her; sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
11613	13	6	8	6	8	Be forewarned, O Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you; I will make you a desolation, a land without inhabitants.”
11614	13	6	9	6	9	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine. Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches.”
11615	13	6	10	6	10	To whom can I give this warning? Who will listen to me? Look, their ears are closed, so they cannot hear. See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them; they find no pleasure in it.
11616	13	6	11	6	11	But I am full of the LORD’s wrath; I am tired of holding it back. “Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the young men gathered together. For both husband and wife will be captured, the old and the very old alike.
11617	13	6	12	6	12	Their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and wives as well, for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land,” declares the LORD.
11618	13	6	13	6	13	“For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for gain. From prophet to priest, all practice deceit.
11619	13	6	14	6	14	They have dressed the wound of My people with very little care, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace at all.
11620	13	6	15	6	15	Were they ashamed of the abomination they committed? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen; when I punish them, they will collapse,” says the LORD.
11621	13	6	16	6	16	This is what the LORD says: “Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths: ‘Where is the good way?’ Then walk in it and find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it!’
11622	13	6	17	6	17	I appointed watchmen over you and said, ‘Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn.’ But they answered, ‘We will not listen!’
11623	13	6	18	6	18	Therefore hear, O nations, and learn, O congregations, what will happen to them.
11624	13	6	19	6	19	Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their own schemes, because they have paid no attention to My word and have rejected My instruction.
11625	13	6	20	6	20	What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please Me.”
11626	13	6	21	6	21	Therefore this is what the LORD says: “I will lay stumbling blocks before this people; fathers and sons alike will be staggered; friends and neighbors will perish.”
11627	13	6	22	6	22	This is what the LORD says: “Behold, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is stirred from the ends of the earth.
11628	13	6	23	6	23	They grasp the bow and spear. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride upon horses, lined up like men in formation against you, O Daughter of Zion.”
11629	13	6	24	6	24	We have heard the reports; our hands are limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like a woman in labor.
11630	13	6	25	6	25	Do not go out to the fields; do not walk the road. For the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.
11631	13	6	26	6	26	O daughter of my people, dress yourselves in sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with bitter wailing, as you would for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
11632	13	6	27	6	27	“I have appointed you to examine My people like ore, so you may know and try their ways.
11633	13	6	28	6	28	All are hardened rebels, walking around as slanderers. They are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt.
11634	13	6	29	6	29	The bellows blow fiercely, blasting away the lead with fire. The refining proceeds in vain, for the wicked are not purged.
11635	13	6	30	6	30	They are called rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them.”
11636	13	7	1	7	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
11637	13	7	2	7	2	“Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD and proclaim this message: Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD.
11638	13	7	3	7	3	Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel: Correct your ways and your deeds, and I will let you live in this place.
11639	13	7	4	7	4	Do not trust in deceptive words, chanting: ‘This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.’
11640	13	7	5	7	5	For if you really change your ways and deeds, if you act justly toward one another,
11641	13	7	6	7	6	if you no longer oppress the foreigner and the fatherless and the widow, and if you no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods to your own harm,
11642	13	7	7	7	7	then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
11643	13	7	8	7	8	But look, you keep trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
11644	13	7	9	7	9	Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known,
11645	13	7	10	7	10	and then come and stand before Me in this house, which bears My Name, and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue with all these abominations’?
11646	13	7	11	7	11	Has this house, which bears My Name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Yes, I too have seen it, declares the LORD.
11647	13	7	12	7	12	But go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for My Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
11648	13	7	13	7	13	And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and because I have spoken to you again and again but you would not listen, and I have called to you but you would not answer,
11649	13	7	14	7	14	therefore what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears My Name, the house in which you trust, the place that I gave to you and your fathers.
11650	13	7	15	7	15	And I will cast you out of My presence, just as I have cast out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.
11651	13	7	16	7	16	As for you, do not pray for these people, do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you.
11652	13	7	17	7	17	Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
11653	13	7	18	7	18	The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
11654	13	7	19	7	19	But am I the One they are provoking? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?
11655	13	7	20	7	20	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the produce of the land, and it will burn and not be extinguished.
11656	13	7	21	7	21	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!
11657	13	7	22	7	22	For when I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt, I did not merely command them about burnt offerings and sacrifices,
11658	13	7	23	7	23	but this is what I commanded them: Obey Me, and I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must walk in all the ways I have commanded you, so that it may go well with you.
11659	13	7	24	7	24	Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts. They went backward and not forward.
11660	13	7	25	7	25	From the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets again and again.
11661	13	7	26	7	26	Yet they would not listen to Me or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and did more evil than their fathers.
11662	13	7	27	7	27	When you tell them all these things, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer.
11663	13	7	28	7	28	Therefore you must say to them, ‘This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not receive correction. Truth has perished; it has disappeared from their lips.
11664	13	7	29	7	29	Cut off your hair and throw it away. Raise up a lamentation on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.’
11665	13	7	30	7	30	For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the LORD. They have set up their abominations in the house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it.
11666	13	7	31	7	31	They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom so they could burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I never commanded, nor did it even enter My mind.
11667	13	7	32	7	32	So beware! The days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
11668	13	7	33	7	33	The corpses of this people will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to scare them away.
11669	13	7	34	7	34	I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of the bride and bridegroom, for the land will become a wasteland.”
11670	13	8	1	8	1	“At that time,” declares the LORD, “the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of the officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
11671	13	8	2	8	2	They will be exposed to the sun and moon, and to all the host of heaven which they have loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped. Their bones will not be gathered up or buried, but will become like dung lying on the ground.
11672	13	8	3	8	3	And wherever I have banished them, the remnant of this evil family will choose death over life,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
11673	13	8	4	8	4	So you are to tell them this is what the LORD says: “Do men fall and not get up again? Does one turn away and not return?
11674	13	8	5	8	5	Why then have these people turned away? Why does Jerusalem always turn away? They cling to deceit; they refuse to return.
11675	13	8	6	8	6	I have listened and heard; they do not speak what is right. No one repents of his wickedness, asking, ‘What have I done?’ Everyone has pursued his own course like a horse charging into battle.
11676	13	8	7	8	7	Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons. The turtledove, the swift, and the thrush keep their time of migration, but My people do not know the requirements of the LORD.
11677	13	8	8	8	8	How can you say, ‘We are wise, and the Law of the LORD is with us,’ when in fact the lying pen of the scribes has produced a deception?
11678	13	8	9	8	9	The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the LORD, what wisdom do they really have?
11679	13	8	10	8	10	Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners, for from the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; from the prophet to the priest, all practice deceit.
11680	13	8	11	8	11	They dress the wounds of the daughter of My people with very little care, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace.
11681	13	8	12	8	12	Are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct? No, they have no shame at all, not even enough to blush. Therefore they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse, says the LORD.
11682	13	8	13	8	13	I will take away their harvest, declares the LORD. There will be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the tree, and even the leaf will wither. Whatever I have given them will be lost to them.”
11683	13	8	14	8	14	Why are we just sitting here? Gather together, let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there, for the LORD our God has doomed us. He has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
11684	13	8	15	8	15	We hoped for peace, but no good has come, for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
11685	13	8	16	8	16	The snorting of enemy horses is heard from Dan. At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds, the whole land quakes. They come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all who dwell in it.
11686	13	8	17	8	17	“For behold, I will send snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you,” declares the LORD.
11687	13	8	18	8	18	My sorrow is beyond healing; my heart is faint within me.
11688	13	8	19	8	19	Listen to the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far away: “Is the LORD no longer in Zion? Is her King no longer there?” “Why have they provoked Me to anger with their carved images, with their worthless foreign idols?”
11689	13	8	20	8	20	“The harvest has passed, the summer has ended, but we have not been saved.”
11690	13	8	21	8	21	For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am crushed. I mourn; horror has gripped me.
11691	13	8	22	8	22	Is there no balm in Gilead? Is no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?
11692	13	8	23	9	1	Oh, that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night over the slain daughter of my people.
11693	13	9	1	9	2	If only I had a traveler’s lodge in the wilderness, I would abandon my people and depart from them, for they are all adulterers, a crowd of faithless people.
11694	13	9	2	9	3	“They bend their tongues like bows; lies prevail over truth in the land. For they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not take Me into account,” declares the LORD.
11695	13	9	3	9	4	“Let everyone guard against his neighbor; do not trust any brother, for every brother deals craftily, and every friend spreads slander.
11696	13	9	4	9	5	Each one betrays his friend; no one tells the truth. They have taught their tongues to lie; they wear themselves out committing iniquity.
11697	13	9	5	9	6	You dwell in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to know Me,” declares the LORD.
11698	13	9	6	9	7	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold, I will refine them and test them, for what else can I do because of the daughter of My people?
11699	13	9	7	9	8	Their tongues are deadly arrows; they speak deception. With his mouth a man speaks peace to his neighbor, but in his heart he sets a trap for him.
11700	13	9	8	9	9	Should I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?”
11701	13	9	9	9	10	I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains, a dirge over the wilderness pasture, for they have been scorched so no one passes through, and the lowing of cattle is not heard. Both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled; they have gone away.
11702	13	9	10	9	11	“And I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a haunt for jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
11703	13	9	11	9	12	Who is the man wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?
11704	13	9	12	9	13	And the LORD answered, “It is because they have forsaken My law, which I set before them; they have not walked in it or obeyed My voice.
11705	13	9	13	9	14	Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts and gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.”
11706	13	9	14	9	15	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will feed this people wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.
11707	13	9	15	9	16	I will scatter them among the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off.”
11708	13	9	16	9	17	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Take note, and summon the wailing women; send for the most skillful among them.
11709	13	9	17	9	18	Let them come quickly and take up a lament over us, that our eyes may overflow with tears, and our eyelids may gush with water.
11710	13	9	18	9	19	For the sound of wailing is heard from Zion: ‘How devastated we are! How great is our shame, for we have abandoned the land because our dwellings have been torn down.’”
11711	13	9	19	9	20	Now, O women, hear the word of the LORD. Open your ears to the word of His mouth. Teach your daughters to wail, and one another to lament.
11712	13	9	20	9	21	For death has climbed in through our windows; it has entered our fortresses to cut off the children from the streets, the young men from the town squares.
11713	13	9	21	9	22	Declare that this is what the LORD says: “The corpses of men will fall like dung upon the open field, like newly cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather it.”
11714	13	9	22	9	23	This is what the LORD says: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength, nor the wealthy man in his riches.
11715	13	9	23	9	24	But let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD, who exercises loving devotion, justice and righteousness on the earth—for I delight in these things,” declares the LORD.
11716	13	9	24	9	25	“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish all who are circumcised yet uncircumcised:
11717	13	9	25	9	26	Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair of their temples. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
11718	13	10	1	10	1	Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
11719	13	10	2	10	2	This is what the LORD says: “Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by the signs in the heavens, though the nations themselves are terrified by them.
11720	13	10	3	10	3	For the customs of the peoples are worthless; they cut down a tree from the forest; it is shaped with a chisel by the hands of a craftsman.
11721	13	10	4	10	4	They adorn it with silver and gold and fasten it with hammer and nails, so that it will not totter.
11722	13	10	5	10	5	Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them, for they can do no harm, and neither can they do any good.”
11723	13	10	6	10	6	There is none like You, O LORD. You are great, and Your name is mighty in power.
11724	13	10	7	10	7	Who would not fear You, O King of nations? This is Your due. For among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.
11725	13	10	8	10	8	But they are altogether senseless and foolish, instructed by worthless idols made of wood!
11726	13	10	9	10	9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz—the work of a craftsman from the hands of a goldsmith. Their clothes are blue and purple, all fashioned by skilled workers.
11727	13	10	10	10	10	But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and eternal King. The earth quakes at His wrath, and the nations cannot endure His indignation.
11728	13	10	11	10	11	Thus you are to tell them: “These gods, who have made neither the heavens nor the earth, will perish from this earth and from under these heavens.”
11729	13	10	12	10	12	God made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
11730	13	10	13	10	13	When He thunders, the waters in the heavens roar, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He sends the lightning with the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
11731	13	10	14	10	14	Everyone is senseless and devoid of knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols. For his molten images are a fraud; they have no breath in them.
11732	13	10	15	10	15	They are worthless, a work to be mocked. In the time of their punishment, they will perish.
11733	13	10	16	10	16	The Portion of Jacob is not like these, for He is the Maker of all things: Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of Hosts is His name.
11734	13	10	17	10	17	Gather up your belongings from this land, you who live under siege.
11735	13	10	18	10	18	For this is what the LORD says: “Behold, at this time I will sling out the inhabitants of the land and bring distress on them so that they may be captured.”
11736	13	10	19	10	19	Woe to me because of my brokenness; my wound is grievous! But I said, “This is truly my sickness, and I must bear it.”
11737	13	10	20	10	20	My tent is destroyed, and all its ropes are snapped. My sons have departed from me and are no more. I have no one left to pitch my tent or set up my curtains.
11738	13	10	21	10	21	For the shepherds have become senseless and do not seek the LORD. Therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.
11739	13	10	22	10	22	Listen! The sound of a report is coming—a great commotion from the land to the north. The cities of Judah will be made a desolation, a haunt for jackals.
11740	13	10	23	10	23	I know, O LORD, that a man’s way is not his own; no one who walks directs his own steps.
11741	13	10	24	10	24	Correct me, O LORD, but only with justice—not in Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing.
11742	13	10	25	10	25	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, and on the families that do not call on Your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have consumed him and finished him off; they have devastated his homeland.
11743	13	11	1	11	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
11744	13	11	2	11	2	“Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
11745	13	11	3	11	3	You must tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,
11746	13	11	4	11	4	which I commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey Me, and do everything I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God.’
11747	13	11	5	11	5	This was in order to establish the oath I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is to this day.” “Amen, LORD,” I answered.
11748	13	11	6	11	6	Then the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the words of this covenant and carry them out.
11749	13	11	7	11	7	For from the time I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt until today, I strongly warned them again and again, saying, ‘Obey My voice.’
11750	13	11	8	11	8	Yet they would not obey or incline their ears, but each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant I had commanded them to follow but they did not keep.”
11751	13	11	9	11	9	And the LORD told me, “There is a conspiracy among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
11752	13	11	10	11	10	They have returned to the sins of their forefathers who refused to obey My words. They have followed other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their fathers.
11753	13	11	11	11	11	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to bring upon them a disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to Me, but I will not listen to them.
11754	13	11	12	11	12	Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to which they have been burning incense, but these gods certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
11755	13	11	13	11	13	Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, O Judah; the altars of shame you have set up—the altars to burn incense to Baal—are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’
11756	13	11	14	11	14	As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be listening when they call out to Me at the time of their disaster.
11757	13	11	15	11	15	What right has My beloved in My house, having carried out so many evil schemes? Can consecrated meat avert your doom, so that you can rejoice?
11758	13	11	16	11	16	The LORD once called you a flourishing olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. But with a mighty roar He will set it on fire, and its branches will be consumed.
11759	13	11	17	11	17	The LORD of Hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you on account of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have brought upon themselves, provoking Me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”
11760	13	11	18	11	18	And the LORD informed me, so I knew. Then You showed me their deeds.
11761	13	11	19	11	19	For I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter; I did not know that they had plotted against me: “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit; let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be remembered no more.”
11762	13	11	20	11	20	But You, O LORD of Hosts—You who judge righteously and test the heart and mind—let me see Your vengeance upon them, for I have committed my cause to You.
11763	13	11	21	11	21	Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the people of Anathoth who are seeking your life and saying, “You must not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand.”
11764	13	11	22	11	22	So this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine.
11765	13	11	23	11	23	There will be no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
11766	13	12	1	12	1	Righteous are You, O LORD, when I plead before You. Yet about Your judgments I wish to contend with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the faithless live at ease?
11767	13	12	2	12	2	You planted them, and they have taken root. They have grown and produced fruit. You are ever on their lips, but far from their hearts.
11768	13	12	3	12	3	But You know me, O LORD; You see me and test my heart toward You. Drag away the wicked like sheep to the slaughter and set them apart for the day of carnage.
11769	13	12	4	12	4	How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field be withered? Because of the evil of its residents, the animals and birds have been swept away, for the people have said, “He cannot see what our end will be.”
11770	13	12	5	12	5	“If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
11771	13	12	6	12	6	Even your brothers—your own father’s household—even they have betrayed you; even they have cried aloud against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you.
11772	13	12	7	12	7	I have forsaken My house; I have abandoned My inheritance. I have given the love of My life into the hands of her enemies.
11773	13	12	8	12	8	My inheritance has become to Me like a lion in the forest. She has roared against Me; therefore I hate her.
11774	13	12	9	12	9	Is not My inheritance to Me like a speckled bird of prey with other birds of prey circling against her? Go, gather all the beasts of the field; bring them to devour her.
11775	13	12	10	12	10	Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My plot of ground. They have turned My pleasant field into a desolate wasteland.
11776	13	12	11	12	11	They have made it a desolation; desolate before Me, it mourns. All the land is laid waste, but no man takes it to heart.
11777	13	12	12	12	12	Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come, for the sword of the LORD devours from one end of the earth to the other. No flesh has peace.
11778	13	12	13	12	13	They have sown wheat but harvested thorns. They have exhausted themselves to no avail. Bear the shame of your harvest because of the fierce anger of the LORD.”
11779	13	12	14	12	14	This is what the LORD says: “As for all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
11780	13	12	15	12	15	But after I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land.
11781	13	12	16	12	16	And if they will diligently learn the ways of My people and swear by My name, saying, ‘As surely as the LORD lives’—just as they once taught My people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among My people.
11782	13	12	17	12	17	But if they will not obey, then I will uproot that nation; I will uproot it and destroy it, declares the LORD.”
11783	13	13	1	13	1	This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, but do not let it touch water.”
11784	13	13	2	13	2	So I bought a loincloth as the LORD had instructed me, and I put it around my waist.
11785	13	13	3	13	3	Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time:
11786	13	13	4	13	4	“Take the loincloth that you bought and are wearing, and go at once to Perath and hide it there in a crevice of the rocks.”
11787	13	13	5	13	5	So I went and hid it at Perath, as the LORD had commanded me.
11788	13	13	6	13	6	Many days later the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to Perath, and get the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
11789	13	13	7	13	7	So I went to Perath and dug up the loincloth, and I took it from the place where I had hidden it. But now it was ruined—of no use at all.
11790	13	13	8	13	8	Then the word of the LORD came to me:
11791	13	13	9	13	9	“This is what the LORD says: In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
11792	13	13	10	13	10	These evil people, who refuse to listen to My words, who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts, and who go after other gods to serve and worship them, they will be like this loincloth—of no use at all.
11793	13	13	11	13	11	For just as a loincloth clings to a man’s waist, so I have made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to Me, declares the LORD, so that they might be My people for My renown and praise and glory. But they did not listen.
11794	13	13	12	13	12	Therefore you are to tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Every wineskin shall be filled with wine.’ And when they reply, ‘Don’t we surely know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’
11795	13	13	13	13	13	then you are to tell them that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land—the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem.
11796	13	13	14	13	14	I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike, declares the LORD. I will allow no mercy or pity or compassion to keep Me from destroying them.’”
11797	13	13	15	13	15	Listen and give heed. Do not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken.
11798	13	13	16	13	16	Give glory to the LORD your God before He brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the dusky mountains. You wait for light, but He turns it into deep gloom and thick darkness.
11799	13	13	17	13	17	But if you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride. My eyes will overflow with tears, because the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.
11800	13	13	18	13	18	Say to the king and to the queen mother: “Take a lowly seat, for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads.”
11801	13	13	19	13	19	The cities of the Negev have been shut tight, and no one can open them. All Judah has been carried into exile, wholly taken captive.
11802	13	13	20	13	20	Lift up your eyes and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock entrusted to you, the sheep that were your pride?
11803	13	13	21	13	21	What will you say when He sets over you close allies whom you yourself trained? Will not pangs of anguish grip you, as they do a woman in labor?
11804	13	13	22	13	22	And if you ask yourself, “Why has this happened to me?” it is because of the magnitude of your iniquity. Your skirts have been stripped off and your body has been exposed.
11805	13	13	23	13	23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Neither are you able to do good—you who are accustomed to doing evil.
11806	13	13	24	13	24	“I will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind.
11807	13	13	25	13	25	This is your lot, the portion I have measured to you,” declares the LORD, “because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood.
11808	13	13	26	13	26	So I will pull your skirts up over your face, that your shame may be seen.
11809	13	13	27	13	27	Your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution on the hills and in the fields—I have seen your detestable acts. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?”
11810	13	14	1	14	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
11811	13	14	2	14	2	“Judah mourns and her gates languish. Her people wail for the land, and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
11812	13	14	3	14	3	The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns, but find no water; their jars return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads.
11813	13	14	4	14	4	The ground is cracked because no rain has fallen on the land. The farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
11814	13	14	5	14	5	Even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass.
11815	13	14	6	14	6	Wild donkeys stand on barren heights; they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of pasture.”
11816	13	14	7	14	7	Although our iniquities testify against us, O LORD, act for the sake of Your name. Indeed, our rebellions are many; we have sinned against You.
11817	13	14	8	14	8	O Hope of Israel, its Savior in times of distress, why are You like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who stays but a night?
11818	13	14	9	14	9	Why are You like a man taken by surprise, like a warrior powerless to save? Yet You are among us, O LORD, and we are called by Your name. Do not forsake us!
11819	13	14	10	14	10	This is what the LORD says about this people: “Truly they love to wander; they have not restrained their feet. So the LORD does not accept them; He will now remember their guilt and call their sins to account.”
11820	13	14	11	14	11	Then the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people.
11821	13	14	12	14	12	Although they may fast, I will not listen to their cry; although they may offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will finish them off by sword and famine and plague.”
11822	13	14	13	14	13	“Ah, Lord GOD!” I replied, “Look, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”
11823	13	14	14	14	14	“The prophets are prophesying lies in My name,” replied the LORD. “I did not send them or appoint them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision, a worthless divination, the futility and delusion of their own minds.
11824	13	14	15	14	15	Therefore this is what the LORD says about the prophets who prophesy in My name: I did not send them, yet they say, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ By sword and famine these very prophets will meet their end!
11825	13	14	16	14	16	And the people to whom they prophesy will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them or their wives, their sons or their daughters. I will pour out their own evil upon them.
11826	13	14	17	14	17	You are to speak this word to them: ‘My eyes overflow with tears; day and night they do not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people has been shattered by a crushing blow, a severely grievous wound.
11827	13	14	18	14	18	If I go out to the country, I see those slain by the sword; if I enter the city, I see those ravaged by famine! For both prophet and priest travel to a land they do not know.’”
11828	13	14	19	14	19	Have You rejected Judah completely? Do You despise Zion? Why have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing? We hoped for peace, but no good has come, and for the time of healing, but there was only terror.
11829	13	14	20	14	20	We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, the guilt of our fathers; indeed, we have sinned against You.
11830	13	14	21	14	21	For the sake of Your name do not despise us; do not disgrace Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us; do not break it.
11831	13	14	22	14	22	Can the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies alone send showers? Is this not by You, O LORD our God? So we put our hope in You, for You have done all these things.
11832	13	15	1	15	1	Then the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My heart would not go out to this people. Send them from My presence, and let them go.
11833	13	15	2	15	2	If they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you are to tell them that this is what the LORD says: ‘Those destined for death, to death; those destined for the sword, to the sword; those destined for famine, to famine; and those destined for captivity, to captivity.’
11834	13	15	3	15	3	I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the air and beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
11835	13	15	4	15	4	I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
11836	13	15	5	15	5	Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Who will mourn for you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
11837	13	15	6	15	6	You have forsaken Me, declares the LORD. You have turned your back. So I will stretch out My hand against you and I will destroy you; I am weary of showing compassion.
11838	13	15	7	15	7	I will scatter them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I will bereave and destroy My people who have not turned from their ways.
11839	13	15	8	15	8	I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. I will bring a destroyer at noon against the mothers of young men. I will suddenly bring upon them anguish and dismay.
11840	13	15	9	15	9	The mother of seven will grow faint; she will breathe her last breath. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. And the rest I will put to the sword in the presence of their enemies,” declares the LORD.
11841	13	15	10	15	10	Woe to me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and conflict in all the land. I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
11842	13	15	11	15	11	The LORD said: “Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will intercede with your enemy in your time of trouble, in your time of distress.
11843	13	15	12	15	12	Can anyone smash iron—iron from the north—or bronze?
11844	13	15	13	15	13	Your wealth and your treasures I will give up as plunder, without charge for all your sins within all your borders.
11845	13	15	14	15	14	Then I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for My anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.”
11846	13	15	15	15	15	You understand, O LORD; remember me and attend to me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In Your patience, do not take me away. Know that I endure reproach for Your honor.
11847	13	15	16	15	16	Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became my joy and my heart’s delight. For I bear Your name, O LORD God of Hosts.
11848	13	15	17	15	17	I never sat with the band of revelers, nor did I celebrate with them. Because Your hand was on me, I sat alone, for You have filled me with indignation.
11849	13	15	18	15	18	Why is my pain unending, and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You have indeed become like a mirage to me—water that is not there.
11850	13	15	19	15	19	Therefore this is what the LORD says: “If you return, I will restore you; you will stand in My presence. And if you speak words that are noble instead of worthless, you will be My spokesman. It is they who must turn to you, but you must not turn to them.
11851	13	15	20	15	20	Then I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you, declares the LORD.
11852	13	15	21	15	21	I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”
11853	13	16	1	16	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
11854	13	16	2	16	2	“You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.”
11855	13	16	3	16	3	For this is what the LORD says concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and the mothers who bore them, and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
11856	13	16	4	16	4	“They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried, but will lie like dung on the ground. They will be finished off by sword and famine, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and beasts of the earth.”
11857	13	16	5	16	5	Indeed, this is what the LORD says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal. Do not go to mourn or show sympathy, for I have removed from this people My peace, My loving devotion, and My compassion,” declares the LORD.
11858	13	16	6	16	6	“Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them.
11859	13	16	7	16	7	No food will be offered to comfort those who mourn the dead; not even a cup of consolation will be given for the loss of a father or mother.
11860	13	16	8	16	8	You must not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down with them to eat and drink.
11861	13	16	9	16	9	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to remove from this place, before your very eyes and in your days, the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the groom and bride.
11862	13	16	10	16	10	When you tell these people all these things, they will ask you, ‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’
11863	13	16	11	16	11	Then you are to answer them: ‘It is because your fathers have forsaken Me, declares the LORD, and followed other gods, and served and worshiped them. They abandoned Me and did not keep My instruction.
11864	13	16	12	16	12	And you have done more evil than your fathers. See how each of you was following the stubbornness of his evil heart instead of obeying Me.
11865	13	16	13	16	13	So I will cast you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
11866	13	16	14	16	14	Yet behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when men will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of Egypt.’
11867	13	16	15	16	15	Instead they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and all the other lands to which He had banished them.’ For I will return them to their land that I gave to their forefathers.
11868	13	16	16	16	16	But for now I will send for many fishermen, declares the LORD, and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill, even from the clefts of the rocks.
11869	13	16	17	16	17	For My eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from My face, and their guilt is not concealed from My eyes.
11870	13	16	18	16	18	And I will first repay them double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and they have filled My inheritance with their abominations.”
11871	13	16	19	16	19	O LORD, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of distress, the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth, and they will say, “Our fathers inherited nothing but lies, worthless idols of no benefit at all.
11872	13	16	20	16	20	Can man make gods for himself? Such are not gods!”
11873	13	16	21	16	21	“Therefore behold, I will inform them, and this time I will make them know My power and My might; then they will know that My name is the LORD.”
11874	13	17	1	17	1	“The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus, engraved with a diamond point on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.
11875	13	17	2	17	2	Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles by the green trees and on the high hills.
11876	13	17	3	17	3	O My mountain in the countryside, I will give over your wealth and all your treasures as plunder, because of the sin of your high places, within all your borders.
11877	13	17	4	17	4	And you yourself will relinquish the inheritance that I gave you. I will enslave you to your enemies in a land that you do not know, for you have kindled My anger; it will burn forever.”
11878	13	17	5	17	5	This is what the LORD says: “Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind, who makes the flesh his strength and turns his heart from the LORD.
11879	13	17	6	17	6	He will be like a shrub in the desert; he will not see when prosperity comes. He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives.
11880	13	17	7	17	7	But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in Him.
11881	13	17	8	17	8	He is like a tree planted by the waters that sends out its roots toward the stream. It does not fear when the heat comes, and its leaves are always green. It does not worry in a year of drought, nor does it cease to produce fruit.
11882	13	17	9	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure—who can understand it?
11883	13	17	10	17	10	I, the LORD, search the heart; I examine the mind to reward a man according to his way, by what his deeds deserve.
11884	13	17	11	17	11	Like a partridge hatching eggs it did not lay is the man who makes a fortune unjustly. In the middle of his days his riches will desert him, and in the end he will be the fool.”
11885	13	17	12	17	12	A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
11886	13	17	13	17	13	O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who abandon You will be put to shame. All who turn away will be written in the dust, for they have abandoned the LORD, the fountain of living water.
11887	13	17	14	17	14	Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for You are my praise.
11888	13	17	15	17	15	Behold, they keep saying to me, “Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now!”
11889	13	17	16	17	16	But I have not run away from being Your shepherd; I have not desired the day of despair. You know that the utterance of my lips was spoken in Your presence.
11890	13	17	17	17	17	Do not become a terror to me; You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
11891	13	17	18	17	18	Let my persecutors be put to shame, but do not let me be put to shame. Let them be terrified, but do not let me be terrified. Bring upon them the day of disaster and shatter them with double destruction.
11892	13	17	19	17	19	This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and stand at the gate of the people, through which the kings of Judah go in and out; and stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem.
11893	13	17	20	17	20	Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, all people of Judah and Jerusalem who enter through these gates.
11894	13	17	21	17	21	This is what the LORD says: Take heed for yourselves; do not carry a load or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
11895	13	17	22	17	22	You must not carry a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath day, but you must keep the Sabbath day holy, just as I commanded your forefathers.
11896	13	17	23	17	23	Yet they would not listen or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and would not listen or receive My discipline.
11897	13	17	24	17	24	If, however, you listen carefully to Me, says the LORD, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and keep the Sabbath day holy, and do no work on it,
11898	13	17	25	17	25	then kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses with their officials, along with the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever.
11899	13	17	26	17	26	And people will come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, and from the foothills, the hill country, and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
11900	13	17	27	17	27	But if you do not listen to Me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in its gates to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.’”
11901	13	18	1	18	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
11902	13	18	2	18	2	“Go down at once to the potter’s house, and there I will reveal My message to you.”
11903	13	18	3	18	3	So I went down to the potter’s house and saw him working at the wheel.
11904	13	18	4	18	4	But the vessel that he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hand; so he formed it into another vessel, as it seemed best for him to do.
11905	13	18	5	18	5	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
11906	13	18	6	18	6	“O house of Israel, declares the LORD, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay? Just like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
11907	13	18	7	18	7	At any time I might announce that a nation or kingdom will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed.
11908	13	18	8	18	8	But if that nation I warned turns from its evil, then I will relent of the disaster I had planned to bring.
11909	13	18	9	18	9	And if at another time I announce that I will build up and establish a nation or kingdom,
11910	13	18	10	18	10	and if it does evil in My sight and does not listen to My voice, then I will relent of the good I had intended for it.
11911	13	18	11	18	11	Now therefore, tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I am planning a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways, and correct your ways and deeds.’
11912	13	18	12	18	12	But they will reply, ‘It is hopeless. We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”
11913	13	18	13	18	13	Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard things like these? Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
11914	13	18	14	18	14	Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave its rocky slopes? Or do its cool waters flowing from a distance ever run dry?
11915	13	18	15	18	15	Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to worthless idols that make them stumble in their ways, leaving the ancient roads to walk on rutted bypaths instead of on the highway.
11916	13	18	16	18	16	They have made their land a desolation, a perpetual object of scorn; everyone who passes by will be appalled and shake their heads.
11917	13	18	17	18	17	I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind. I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity.”
11918	13	18	18	18	18	Then some said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the wise, nor an oracle to the prophet. Come, let us denounce him and pay no heed to any of his words.”
11919	13	18	19	18	19	Attend to me, O LORD. Hear what my accusers are saying!
11920	13	18	20	18	20	Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your wrath from them.
11921	13	18	21	18	21	Therefore, hand their children over to famine; pour out the power of the sword upon them. Let their wives become childless and widowed; let their husbands be slain by disease, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
11922	13	18	22	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring raiders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.
11923	13	18	23	18	23	But You, O LORD, know all their deadly plots against me. Do not wipe out their guilt or blot out their sin from Your sight. Let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
11924	13	19	1	19	1	This is what the LORD says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take some of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests,
11925	13	19	2	19	2	and go out to the valley of Ben-hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words I speak to you,
11926	13	19	3	19	3	saying, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that the ears of all who hear of it will ring,
11927	13	19	4	19	4	because they have abandoned Me and made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in it to other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have ever known. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
11928	13	19	5	19	5	They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I never commanded or mentioned, nor did it even enter My mind.
11929	13	19	6	19	6	So behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
11930	13	19	7	19	7	And in this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek their lives, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
11931	13	19	8	19	8	I will make this city a desolation and an object of scorn. All who pass by will be horrified, and will scoff because of all its wounds.
11932	13	19	9	19	9	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh in the siege and distress inflicted on them by their enemies who seek their lives.’
11933	13	19	10	19	10	Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the men who accompany you,
11934	13	19	11	19	11	and you are to proclaim to them that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I will shatter this nation and this city, like one shatters a potter’s jar that can never again be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room to bury them.
11935	13	19	12	19	12	This is what I will do to this place and to its residents, declares the LORD. I will make this city like Topheth.
11936	13	19	13	19	13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like that place, Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops they burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”
11937	13	19	14	19	14	Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD’s house and proclaimed to all the people,
11938	13	19	15	19	15	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am about to bring on this city and on all the villages around it every disaster I have pronounced against them, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.’”
11939	13	20	1	20	1	When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and the chief official in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,
11940	13	20	2	20	2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.
11941	13	20	3	20	3	The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call you Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
11942	13	20	4	20	4	For this is what the LORD says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. And I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away to Babylon and put them to the sword.
11943	13	20	5	20	5	I will give away all the wealth of this city—all its products and valuables, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah—to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon.
11944	13	20	6	20	6	And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, and there you will die and be buried—you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied these lies.’”
11945	13	20	7	20	7	You have deceived me, O LORD, and I was deceived. You have overcome me and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.
11946	13	20	8	20	8	For whenever I speak, I cry out; I proclaim violence and destruction. For the word of the LORD has become to me a reproach and derision all day long.
11947	13	20	9	20	9	If I say, “I will not mention Him or speak any more in His name,” His message becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones, and I become weary of holding it in, and I cannot prevail.
11948	13	20	10	20	10	For I have heard the whispering of many: “Terror is on every side! Report him; let us report him!” All my trusted friends watch for my fall: “Perhaps he will be deceived so that we may prevail against him and take our vengeance upon him.”
11949	13	20	11	20	11	But the LORD is with me like a fearsome warrior. Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and will not prevail. Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly put to shame, with an everlasting disgrace that will never be forgotten.
11950	13	20	12	20	12	O LORD of Hosts, who examines the righteous, who sees the heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance upon them, for to You I have committed my cause.
11951	13	20	13	20	13	Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD! For He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.
11952	13	20	14	20	14	Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.
11953	13	20	15	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, saying, “A son is born to you,” bringing him great joy.
11954	13	20	16	20	16	May that man be like the cities that the LORD overthrew without compassion. May he hear an outcry in the morning and a battle cry at noon,
11955	13	20	17	20	17	because he did not kill me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb forever enlarged.
11956	13	20	18	20	18	Why did I come out of the womb to see only trouble and sorrow, and to end my days in shame?
11957	13	21	1	21	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said,
11958	13	21	2	21	2	“Please inquire of the LORD on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonders, so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us.”
11959	13	21	3	21	3	But Jeremiah answered, “You are to tell Zedekiah the following:
11960	13	21	4	21	4	‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will turn against you the weapons of war in your hands, with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the wall, and I will assemble their forces in the center of this city.
11961	13	21	5	21	5	And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, fury, and great wrath.
11962	13	21	6	21	6	I will strike down the residents of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a terrible plague.
11963	13	21	7	21	7	After that, declares the LORD, I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officers, and the people in this city who survive the plague and sword and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword; he will not spare them or show pity or compassion.’
11964	13	21	8	21	8	You are also to say to this people, ‘This is what the LORD says: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
11965	13	21	9	21	9	Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who besiege you will live and retain his life like a spoil of war.
11966	13	21	10	21	10	For I have set My face against this city to bring disaster and not good, declares the LORD. It will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, who will destroy it with fire.’
11967	13	21	11	21	11	Moreover, tell the house of the king of Judah to hear the word of the LORD.
11968	13	21	12	21	12	O house of David, this is what the LORD says: ‘Administer justice every morning, and rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor, or My wrath will go forth like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it because of their evil deeds.
11969	13	21	13	21	13	Behold, I am against you who dwell above the valley, atop the rocky plateau—declares the LORD—you who say, “Who can come against us? Who can enter our dwellings?”
11970	13	21	14	21	14	I will punish you as your deeds deserve, declares the LORD. I will kindle a fire in your forest that will consume everything around you.’”
11971	13	22	1	22	1	This is what the LORD says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there,
11972	13	22	2	22	2	saying, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David—you and your officials and your people who enter these gates.
11973	13	22	3	22	3	This is what the LORD says: Administer justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Do not shed innocent blood in this place.
11974	13	22	4	22	4	For if you will indeed carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this palace riding on chariots and horses—they and their officials and their people.
11975	13	22	5	22	5	But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by Myself, declares the LORD, that this house will become a pile of rubble.’”
11976	13	22	6	22	6	For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah: “You are like Gilead to Me, like the summit of Lebanon; but I will certainly turn you into a desert, like cities that are uninhabited.
11977	13	22	7	22	7	I will appoint destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut down the choicest of your cedars and throw them into the fire.
11978	13	22	8	22	8	And many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?’
11979	13	22	9	22	9	Then people will reply, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’”
11980	13	22	10	22	10	Do not weep for the dead king; do not mourn his loss. Weep bitterly for the one who is exiled, for he will never return to see his native land.
11981	13	22	11	22	11	For this is what the LORD says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father Josiah but has gone forth from this place: “He will never return,
11982	13	22	12	22	12	but he will die in the place to which he was exiled; he will never see this land again.”
11983	13	22	13	22	13	“Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms without justice, who makes his countrymen serve without pay, and fails to pay their wages,
11984	13	22	14	22	14	who says, ‘I will build myself a great palace, with spacious upper rooms.’ So he cuts windows in it, panels it with cedar, and paints it with vermilion.
11985	13	22	15	22	15	Does it make you a king to excel in cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He administered justice and righteousness, and so it went well with him.
11986	13	22	16	22	16	He took up the cause of the poor and needy, and so it went well with him. Is this not what it means to know Me?” declares the LORD.
11987	13	22	17	22	17	“But your eyes and heart are set on nothing except your own dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood, on practicing extortion and oppression.”
11988	13	22	18	22	18	Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: “They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’ They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’
11989	13	22	19	22	19	He will be buried like a donkey, dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
11990	13	22	20	22	20	Go up to Lebanon and cry out; raise your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers have been crushed.
11991	13	22	21	22	21	I warned you when you were secure. You said, ‘I will not listen.’ This has been your way from youth, that you have not obeyed My voice.
11992	13	22	22	22	22	The wind will drive away all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity. Then you will be ashamed and humiliated because of all your wickedness.
11993	13	22	23	22	23	O inhabitant of Lebanon, nestled in the cedars, how you will groan when pangs of anguish come upon you, agony like a woman in labor.”
11994	13	22	24	22	24	“As surely as I live,” declares the LORD, “even if you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on My right hand, I would pull you off.
11995	13	22	25	22	25	In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who want to take your life—to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Chaldeans.
11996	13	22	26	22	26	I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another land, where neither of you were born—and there you both will die.
11997	13	22	27	22	27	You will never return to the land for which you long.”
11998	13	22	28	22	28	Is this man Coniah a despised and shattered pot, a jar that no one wants? Why are he and his descendants hurled out and cast into a land they do not know?
11999	13	22	29	22	29	O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!
12000	13	22	30	22	30	This is what the LORD says: “Enroll this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime. None of his descendants will prosper to sit on the throne of David or to rule again in Judah.”
12001	13	23	1	23	1	“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!” declares the LORD.
12002	13	23	2	23	2	Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who tend My people: “You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your deeds, declares the LORD.
12003	13	23	3	23	3	Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands to which I have banished them, and I will return them to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and multiply.
12004	13	23	4	23	4	I will raise up shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or dismayed, nor will any go missing, declares the LORD.
12005	13	23	5	23	5	Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and He will reign wisely as King and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
12006	13	23	6	23	6	In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is His name by which He will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness.
12007	13	23	7	23	7	So behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of Egypt.’
12008	13	23	8	23	8	Instead they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought and led the descendants of the house of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the other countries to which I had banished them.’ Then they will dwell once more in their own land.”
12009	13	23	9	23	9	As for the prophets: My heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the LORD, because of His holy words.
12010	13	23	10	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers—because of the curse, the land mourns and the pastures of the wilderness have dried up—their course is evil and their power is misused.
12011	13	23	11	23	11	“For both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in My house I have found their wickedness,” declares the LORD.
12012	13	23	12	23	12	“Therefore their path will become slick; they will be driven away into the gloom and fall into it. For I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment,” declares the LORD.
12013	13	23	13	23	13	“Among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
12014	13	23	14	23	14	And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns his back on wickedness. They are all like Sodom to Me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”
12015	13	23	15	23	15	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says concerning the prophets: “I will feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.”
12016	13	23	16	23	16	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are filling you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
12017	13	23	17	23	17	They keep saying to those who despise Me, ‘The LORD says that you will have peace,’ and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, ‘No harm will come to you.’
12018	13	23	18	23	18	But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and hear His word? Who has given heed to His word and obeyed it?
12019	13	23	19	23	19	Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone out in fury, a whirlwind swirling down upon the heads of the wicked.
12020	13	23	20	23	20	The anger of the LORD will not diminish until He has fully accomplished the purposes of His heart. In the days to come you will understand it clearly.
12021	13	23	21	23	21	I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied.
12022	13	23	22	23	22	But if they had stood in My council, they would have proclaimed My words to My people and turned them back from their evil ways and evil deeds.”
12023	13	23	23	23	23	“Am I only a God nearby,” declares the LORD, “and not a God far away?”
12024	13	23	24	23	24	“Can a man hide in secret places where I cannot see him?” declares the LORD. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the LORD.
12025	13	23	25	23	25	“I have heard the sayings of the prophets who prophesy lies in My name: ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’
12026	13	23	26	23	26	How long will this continue in the hearts of these prophets who prophesy falsehood, these prophets of the delusion of their own minds?
12027	13	23	27	23	27	They suppose the dreams that they tell one another will make My people forget My name, just as their fathers forgot My name through the worship of Baal.
12028	13	23	28	23	28	Let the prophet who has a dream retell it, but let him who has My word speak it truthfully. For what is straw compared to grain?” declares the LORD.
12029	13	23	29	23	29	“Is not My word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that smashes a rock?”
12030	13	23	30	23	30	“Therefore behold,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who steal from each other words they attribute to Me.”
12031	13	23	31	23	31	“Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and proclaim, ‘The LORD declares it.’”
12032	13	23	32	23	32	“Indeed,” declares the LORD, “I am against those who prophesy false dreams and retell them to lead My people astray with their reckless lies. It was not I who sent them or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people,” declares the LORD.
12033	13	23	33	23	33	“Now when this people or a prophet or priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you are to say to them, ‘What burden? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.’
12034	13	23	34	23	34	As for the prophet or priest or anyone who claims, ‘This is the burden of the LORD,’ I will punish that man and his household.
12035	13	23	35	23	35	This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother: ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
12036	13	23	36	23	36	But no longer refer to the burden of the LORD, for each man’s word becomes the burden, so that you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of Hosts, our God.
12037	13	23	37	23	37	Thus you are to say to the prophet: ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
12038	13	23	38	23	38	But if you claim, ‘This is the burden of the LORD,’ then this is what the LORD says: Because you have said, ‘This is the burden of the LORD,’ and I specifically told you not to make this claim,
12039	13	23	39	23	39	therefore I will surely forget you and will cast you out of My presence, both you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.
12040	13	23	40	23	40	And I will bring upon you everlasting shame and perpetual humiliation that will never be forgotten.”
12041	13	24	1	24	1	After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, as well as the officials of Judah and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD.
12042	13	24	2	24	2	One basket had very good figs, like those that ripen early, but the other basket contained very poor figs, so bad they could not be eaten.
12043	13	24	3	24	3	“Jeremiah,” the LORD asked, “what do you see?” “Figs!” I replied. “The good figs are very good, but the bad figs are very bad, so bad they cannot be eaten.”
12044	13	24	4	24	4	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12045	13	24	5	24	5	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
12046	13	24	6	24	6	I will keep My eyes on them for good and will return them to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.
12047	13	24	7	24	7	I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD. They will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with all their heart.
12048	13	24	8	24	8	But like the bad figs, so bad they cannot be eaten,’ says the LORD, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem—those remaining in this land and those living in the land of Egypt.
12049	13	24	9	24	9	I will make them a horror and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace and an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing wherever I have banished them.
12050	13	24	10	24	10	And I will send against them sword and famine and plague, until they have perished from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’”
12051	13	25	1	25	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
12052	13	25	2	25	2	So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
12053	13	25	3	25	3	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—twenty-three years—the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.
12054	13	25	4	25	4	And the LORD has sent all His servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear.
12055	13	25	5	25	5	The prophets told you, ‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and evil deeds, and you can dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever.
12056	13	25	6	25	6	Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’
12057	13	25	7	25	7	‘But to your own harm, you have not listened to Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘so you have provoked Me to anger with the works of your hands.’
12058	13	25	8	25	8	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,
12059	13	25	9	25	9	behold, I will summon all the families of the north, declares the LORD, and I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, whom I will bring against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations. So I will devote them to destruction and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation.
12060	13	25	10	25	10	Moreover, I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
12061	13	25	11	25	11	And this whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
12062	13	25	12	25	12	But when seventy years are complete, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, declares the LORD, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
12063	13	25	13	25	13	I will bring upon that land all the words I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
12064	13	25	14	25	14	For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.’”
12065	13	25	15	25	15	This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it.
12066	13	25	16	25	16	And they will drink and stagger and go out of their minds, because of the sword that I will send among them.”
12067	13	25	17	25	17	So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand and made all the nations drink from it, each one to whom the LORD had sent me,
12068	13	25	18	25	18	to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and cursing, as they are to this day—Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials;
12069	13	25	19	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his people;
12070	13	25	20	25	20	all the mixed tribes; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
12071	13	25	21	25	21	Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
12072	13	25	22	25	22	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
12073	13	25	23	25	23	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;
12074	13	25	24	25	24	all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
12075	13	25	25	25	25	all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;
12076	13	25	26	25	26	all the kings of the north, both near and far, one after another—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink it too.
12077	13	25	27	25	27	“Then you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, because of the sword I will send among you.’
12078	13	25	28	25	28	If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘You most certainly must drink it!
12079	13	25	29	25	29	For behold, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My Name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of Hosts.’
12080	13	25	30	25	30	So you are to prophesy all these words against them and say to them: ‘The LORD will roar from on high; He will raise His voice from His holy habitation. He will roar loudly over His pasture; like those who tread the grapes, He will call out with a shout against all the inhabitants of the earth.
12081	13	25	31	25	31	The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth because the LORD brings a charge against the nations. He brings judgment on all mankind and puts the wicked to the sword,’” declares the LORD.
12082	13	25	32	25	32	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”
12083	13	25	33	25	33	Those slain by the LORD on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung lying on the ground.
12084	13	25	34	25	34	Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For the days of your slaughter have come; you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.
12085	13	25	35	25	35	Flight will evade the shepherds, and escape will elude the leaders of the flock.
12086	13	25	36	25	36	Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture.
12087	13	25	37	25	37	The peaceful meadows have been silenced because of the LORD’s burning anger.
12088	13	25	38	25	38	He has left His den like a lion, for their land has been made a desolation by the sword of the oppressor, and because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
12089	13	26	1	26	1	At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
12090	13	26	2	26	2	“This is what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the LORD’s house and speak all the words I have commanded you to speak to all the cities of Judah who come to worship there. Do not omit a word.
12091	13	26	3	26	3	Perhaps they will listen and turn—each from his evil way of life—so that I may relent of the disaster I am planning to bring upon them because of the evil of their deeds.
12092	13	26	4	26	4	And you are to tell them that this is what the LORD says: ‘If you do not listen to Me and walk in My law, which I have set before you,
12093	13	26	5	26	5	and if you do not listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have sent you again and again even though you did not listen,
12094	13	26	6	26	6	then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth.’”
12095	13	26	7	26	7	Now the priests and prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD,
12096	13	26	8	26	8	and as soon as he had finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests and prophets and all the people seized him, shouting, “You must surely die!
12097	13	26	9	26	9	How dare you prophesy in the name of the LORD that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted!” And all the people assembled against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
12098	13	26	10	26	10	When the officials of Judah heard these things, they went up from the king’s palace to the house of the LORD and sat at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’s house.
12099	13	26	11	26	11	Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man is worthy of death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears!”
12100	13	26	12	26	12	And Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
12101	13	26	13	26	13	So now, correct your ways and deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, so that He might relent of the disaster He has pronounced against you.
12102	13	26	14	26	14	As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right.
12103	13	26	15	26	15	But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its residents; for truly the LORD has sent me to speak all these words in your hearing.”
12104	13	26	16	26	16	Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, “This man is not worthy of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God!”
12105	13	26	17	26	17	Some of the elders of the land stood up and said to the whole assembly of the people,
12106	13	26	18	26	18	“Micah the Moreshite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and told all the people of Judah that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple mount a wooded ridge.’
12107	13	26	19	26	19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did Hezekiah not fear the LORD and seek His favor, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster He had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great harm on ourselves!”
12108	13	26	20	26	20	Now there was another man prophesying in the name of the LORD, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land the same things that Jeremiah did.
12109	13	26	21	26	21	King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and officials heard his words, and the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah found out about it, he fled in fear and went to Egypt.
12110	13	26	22	26	22	Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Achbor along with some other men.
12111	13	26	23	26	23	They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and threw his body into the burial place of the common people.
12112	13	26	24	26	24	Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
12113	13	27	1	27	1	At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
12114	13	27	2	27	2	This is what the LORD said to me: “Make for yourself a yoke out of leather straps and put it on your neck.
12115	13	27	3	27	3	Send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
12116	13	27	4	27	4	Give them a message from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, to relay to their masters:
12117	13	27	5	27	5	By My great power and outstretched arm, I made the earth and the men and beasts on the face of it, and I give it to whom I please.
12118	13	27	6	27	6	So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I have even made the beasts of the field subject to him.
12119	13	27	7	27	7	All nations will serve him and his son and grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
12120	13	27	8	27	8	As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation by sword and famine and plague, declares the LORD, until I have destroyed it by his hand.
12121	13	27	9	27	9	But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums, or your sorcerers who declare, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’
12122	13	27	10	27	10	For they prophesy to you a lie that will serve to remove you from your land; I will banish you and you will perish.
12123	13	27	11	27	11	But the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave in its own land, to cultivate it and reside in it, declares the LORD.”
12124	13	27	12	27	12	And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke the same message: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and live!
12125	13	27	13	27	13	Why should you and your people die by sword and famine and plague, as the LORD has decreed against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?
12126	13	27	14	27	14	Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying to you a lie.
12127	13	27	15	27	15	For I have not sent them, declares the LORD, and yet they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore I will banish you, and you will perish—you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”
12128	13	27	16	27	16	Then I said to the priests and to all this people, “This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Look, very soon now the articles of the LORD’s temple will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying to you a lie.
12129	13	27	17	27	17	Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
12130	13	27	18	27	18	If they are indeed prophets and the word of the LORD is with them, let them now plead with the LORD of Hosts that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, not be taken to Babylon.
12131	13	27	19	27	19	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the articles that remain in this city,
12132	13	27	20	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
12133	13	27	21	27	21	Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
12134	13	27	22	27	22	‘They will be carried to Babylon and will remain there until the day I attend to them again,’ declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’”
12135	13	28	1	28	1	In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, near the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:
12136	13	28	2	28	2	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
12137	13	28	3	28	3	Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and carried to Babylon.
12138	13	28	4	28	4	And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”
12139	13	28	5	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD.
12140	13	28	6	28	6	“Amen!” Jeremiah said. “May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied, and may He restore the articles of His house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
12141	13	28	7	28	7	Nevertheless, listen now to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
12142	13	28	8	28	8	The prophets of old who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms.
12143	13	28	9	28	9	As for the prophet who prophesies peace, only if the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the LORD has truly sent.”
12144	13	28	10	28	10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
12145	13	28	11	28	11	And in the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the LORD says: ‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations.’” At this, Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.
12146	13	28	12	28	12	But shortly after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke off his neck, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12147	13	28	13	28	13	“Go and tell Hananiah that this is what the LORD says: ‘You have broken a yoke of wood, but in its place you have fashioned a yoke of iron.’
12148	13	28	14	28	14	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have even given him control of the beasts of the field.’”
12149	13	28	15	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, but you have persuaded this people to trust in a lie.
12150	13	28	16	28	16	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.’”
12151	13	28	17	28	17	And in the seventh month of that very year, the prophet Hananiah died.
12152	13	29	1	29	1	This is the text of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets, and all the others Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
12153	13	29	2	29	2	(This was after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalsmiths had been exiled from Jerusalem.)
12154	13	29	3	29	3	The letter was entrusted to Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It stated:
12155	13	29	4	29	4	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles who were carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
12156	13	29	5	29	5	“Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce.
12157	13	29	6	29	6	Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease.
12158	13	29	7	29	7	Seek the prosperity of the city to which I have sent you as exiles. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for if it prospers, you too will prosper.”
12159	13	29	8	29	8	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners among you, and do not listen to the dreams you elicit from them.
12160	13	29	9	29	9	For they are falsely prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them, declares the LORD.”
12161	13	29	10	29	10	For this is what the LORD says: “When Babylon’s seventy years are complete, I will attend to you and confirm My promise to restore you to this place.
12162	13	29	11	29	11	For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, to give you a future and a hope.
12163	13	29	12	29	12	Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
12164	13	29	13	29	13	You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
12165	13	29	14	29	14	I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore you from captivity and gather you from all the nations and places to which I have banished you, declares the LORD. I will restore you to the place from which I sent you into exile.”
12166	13	29	15	29	15	Because you may say, “The LORD has raised up for us prophets in Babylon,”
12167	13	29	16	29	16	this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile—
12168	13	29	17	29	17	this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I will send against them sword and famine and plague, and I will make them like rotten figs, so bad that they cannot be eaten.
12169	13	29	18	29	18	I will pursue them with sword and famine and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—a curse, a desolation, and an object of scorn and reproach among all the nations to which I banish them.
12170	13	29	19	29	19	I will do this because they have not listened to My words, declares the LORD, which I sent to them again and again through My servants the prophets. And neither have you exiles listened, declares the LORD.”
12171	13	29	20	29	20	So hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
12172	13	29	21	29	21	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you lies in My name: “I will deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your very eyes.
12173	13	29	22	29	22	Because of them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!’
12174	13	29	23	29	23	For they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors and speaking lies in My name, which I did not command them to do. I am He who knows, and I am a witness, declares the LORD.”
12175	13	29	24	29	24	You are to tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite that
12176	13	29	25	29	25	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “In your own name you have sent out letters to all the people of Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests. You said to Zephaniah:
12177	13	29	26	29	26	‘The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada, to be the chief officer in the house of the LORD, responsible for any madman who acts like a prophet—you must put him in stocks and neck irons.
12178	13	29	27	29	27	So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you?
12179	13	29	28	29	28	For he has sent to us in Babylon, claiming: The exile will be lengthy. So build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce.’”
12180	13	29	29	29	29	(Zephaniah the priest, however, had read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.)
12181	13	29	30	29	30	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12182	13	29	31	29	31	“Send a message to all the exiles: This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite. Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you—though I did not send him—and has made you trust in a lie,
12183	13	29	32	29	32	this is what the LORD says: ‘I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good that I will bring to My people, declares the LORD, for he has preached rebellion against the LORD.’”
12184	13	30	1	30	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
12185	13	30	2	30	2	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
12186	13	30	3	30	3	For behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore from captivity My people Israel and Judah, declares the LORD. I will restore them to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’”
12187	13	30	4	30	4	These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
12188	13	30	5	30	5	Yes, this is what the LORD says: “A cry of panic is heard—a cry of terror, not of peace.
12189	13	30	6	30	6	Ask now, and see: Can a male give birth? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor and every face turned pale?
12190	13	30	7	30	7	How awful that day will be! None will be like it! It is the time of Jacob’s distress, but he will be saved out of it.
12191	13	30	8	30	8	On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, I will break the yoke off their necks and tear off their bonds, and no longer will strangers enslave them.
12192	13	30	9	30	9	Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
12193	13	30	10	30	10	As for you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid, declares the LORD, and do not be dismayed, O Israel; for I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return to quiet and ease, with no one to frighten him.
12194	13	30	11	30	11	For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD. Though I will completely destroy all the nations to which I have scattered you, I will not completely destroy you; yet I will correct you justly, and will by no means leave you unpunished.”
12195	13	30	12	30	12	For this is what the LORD says: “Your injury is incurable; your wound is grievous.
12196	13	30	13	30	13	There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sores, no recovery for you.
12197	13	30	14	30	14	All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer seek you, for I have struck you as an enemy would, with the discipline of someone cruel, because of your great iniquity and your numerous sins.
12198	13	30	15	30	15	Why do you cry out over your wound? Your pain has no cure! Because of your great iniquity and your numerous sins I have done these things to you.
12199	13	30	16	30	16	Nevertheless, all who devour you will be devoured, and all your adversaries—every one of them—will go off into exile. Those who plundered you will be plundered, and all who raided you will be raided.
12200	13	30	17	30	17	But I will restore your health and heal your wounds, declares the LORD, because they call you an outcast, Zion, for whom no one cares.”
12201	13	30	18	30	18	This is what the LORD says: “I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and have compassion on his dwellings. And the city will be rebuilt on her own ruins, and the palace will stand in its rightful place.
12202	13	30	19	30	19	Thanksgiving will proceed from them, a sound of celebration. I will multiply them, and they will not be decreased; I will honor them, and they will not be belittled.
12203	13	30	20	30	20	Their children will be as in days of old, and their congregation will be established before Me; and I will punish all their oppressors.
12204	13	30	21	30	21	Their leader will be one of their own, and their ruler will arise from their midst. And I will bring him near, and he will approach Me, for who would dare on his own to approach Me?” declares the LORD.
12205	13	30	22	30	22	“And you will be My people, and I will be your God.”
12206	13	30	23	30	23	Behold, the tempest of the LORD—wrath has gone forth—a churning storm! It will swirl about the heads of the wicked.
12207	13	30	24	30	24	The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until He has fully accomplished the purposes of His heart. In the days to come you will understand this.
12208	13	31	1	31	1	“At that time,” declares the LORD, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people.”
12209	13	31	2	31	2	This is what the LORD says: “The people who survived the sword found favor in the wilderness when Israel went to find rest.”
12210	13	31	3	31	3	The LORD appeared to us in the past, saying: “I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with loving devotion.
12211	13	31	4	31	4	Again I will build you, and you will be rebuilt, O Virgin Israel. Again you will take up your tambourines and go out in joyful dancing.
12212	13	31	5	31	5	Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant and enjoy the fruit.
12213	13	31	6	31	6	For there will be a day when watchmen will call out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Arise, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God!’”
12214	13	31	7	31	7	For this is what the LORD says: “Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations! Make your praises heard, and say, ‘O LORD, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!’
12215	13	31	8	31	8	Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, including the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor. They will return as a great assembly!
12216	13	31	9	31	9	They will come with weeping, and by their supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk beside streams of waters, on a level path where they will not stumble. For I am Israel’s Father, and Ephraim is My firstborn.”
12217	13	31	10	31	10	Hear, O nations, the word of the LORD, and proclaim it in distant coastlands: “The One who scattered Israel will gather them and keep them as a shepherd keeps his flock.
12218	13	31	11	31	11	For the LORD has ransomed Jacob and redeemed him from the hand that had overpowered him.
12219	13	31	12	31	12	They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant over the bounty of the LORD—the grain, new wine, and oil, and the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like a well-watered garden, and never again will they languish.
12220	13	31	13	31	13	Then the maidens will rejoice with dancing, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into joy, and give them comfort and joy for their sorrow.
12221	13	31	14	31	14	I will fill the souls of the priests abundantly, and will fill My people with My goodness,” declares the LORD.
12222	13	31	15	31	15	This is what the LORD says: “A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
12223	13	31	16	31	16	This is what the LORD says: “Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for the reward for your work will come, declares the LORD. Then your children will return from the land of the enemy.
12224	13	31	17	31	17	So there is hope for your future, declares the LORD, and your children will return to their own land.
12225	13	31	18	31	18	I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning: ‘You disciplined me severely, like an untrained calf. Restore me, that I may return, for You are the LORD my God.
12226	13	31	19	31	19	After I returned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh in grief. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’
12227	13	31	20	31	20	Is not Ephraim a precious son to Me, a delightful child? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore My heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him,” declares the LORD.
12228	13	31	21	31	21	“Set up the roadmarks, establish the signposts. Keep the highway in mind, the road you have traveled. Return, O Virgin Israel, return to these cities of yours.
12229	13	31	22	31	22	How long will you wander, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the land—a woman will shelter a man.”
12230	13	31	23	31	23	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “When I restore them from captivity, they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities: ‘May the LORD bless you, O righteous dwelling place, O holy mountain.’
12231	13	31	24	31	24	And Judah and all its cities will dwell together in the land, the farmers and those who move with the flocks,
12232	13	31	25	31	25	for I will refresh the weary soul and replenish all who are weak.”
12233	13	31	26	31	26	At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
12234	13	31	27	31	27	“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and of beast.
12235	13	31	28	31	28	Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, to demolish, destroy, and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the LORD.
12236	13	31	29	31	29	“In those days, it will no longer be said: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.’
12237	13	31	30	31	30	Instead, each will die for his own iniquity. If anyone eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will be set on edge.
12238	13	31	31	31	31	Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
12239	13	31	32	31	32	It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant they broke, though I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD.
12240	13	31	33	31	33	“But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD. I will put My law in their minds and inscribe it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they will be My people.
12241	13	31	34	31	34	No longer will each man teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquities and will remember their sins no more.”
12242	13	31	35	31	35	Thus says the LORD, who gives the sun for light by day, who sets in order the moon and stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the LORD of Hosts is His name:
12243	13	31	36	31	36	“Only if this fixed order departed from My presence, declares the LORD, would Israel’s descendants ever cease to be a nation before Me.”
12244	13	31	37	31	37	This is what the LORD says: “Only if the heavens above could be measured and the foundations of the earth below searched out, would I reject all of Israel’s descendants because of all they have done,” declares the LORD.
12245	13	31	38	31	38	“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this city will be rebuilt for Me, from the tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
12246	13	31	39	31	39	The measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.
12247	13	31	40	31	40	The whole valley of the dead bodies and ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east, will be holy to the LORD. It will never again be uprooted or demolished.”
12248	13	32	1	32	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
12249	13	32	2	32	2	At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was in the palace of the king of Judah.
12250	13	32	3	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: “Why are you prophesying like this? You claim that the LORD says, ‘Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
12251	13	32	4	32	4	Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hands of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon to speak with him face to face and to see him eye to eye.
12252	13	32	5	32	5	He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.’”
12253	13	32	6	32	6	Jeremiah replied, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
12254	13	32	7	32	7	Behold! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.’
12255	13	32	8	32	8	Then, as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.’” Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
12256	13	32	9	32	9	So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver.
12257	13	32	10	32	10	I signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
12258	13	32	11	32	11	Then I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy with its terms and conditions, as well as the open copy—
12259	13	32	12	32	12	and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement and all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
12260	13	32	13	32	13	In their sight I instructed Baruch,
12261	13	32	14	32	14	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these deeds—both the sealed copy and the open copy of the deed of purchase—and put them in a clay jar to preserve them for a long time.
12262	13	32	15	32	15	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”
12263	13	32	16	32	16	After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:
12264	13	32	17	32	17	“Oh, Lord GOD! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You!
12265	13	32	18	32	18	You show loving devotion to thousands but lay the iniquity of the fathers into the laps of their children after them, O great and mighty God whose name is the LORD of Hosts,
12266	13	32	19	32	19	the One great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men, to reward each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
12267	13	32	20	32	20	You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and You do so to this very day, both in Israel and among all mankind. And You have made a name for Yourself, as is the case to this day.
12268	13	32	21	32	21	You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
12269	13	32	22	32	22	You gave them this land that You had sworn to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
12270	13	32	23	32	23	They came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law. They failed to perform all that You commanded them to do, and so You have brought upon them all this disaster.
12271	13	32	24	32	24	See how the siege ramps are mounted against the city to capture it. And by sword and famine and plague, the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened, as You now see!
12272	13	32	25	32	25	Yet You, O Lord GOD, have said to me, ‘Buy for yourself the field with silver and call in witnesses, even though the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans!’”
12273	13	32	26	32	26	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12274	13	32	27	32	27	“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?
12275	13	32	28	32	28	Therefore this is what the LORD says: Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.
12276	13	32	29	32	29	And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come in, set it on fire, and burn it, along with the houses of those who provoked Me to anger by burning incense to Baal on their rooftops and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
12277	13	32	30	32	30	For the children of Israel and of Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth; indeed, they have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
12278	13	32	31	32	31	For this city has aroused My wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. Therefore I will remove it from My presence
12279	13	32	32	32	32	because of all the evil the children of Israel and of Judah have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.
12280	13	32	33	32	33	They have turned their backs to Me and not their faces. Though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.
12281	13	32	34	32	34	They have placed their abominations in the house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it.
12282	13	32	35	32	35	They have built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire to Molech—something I never commanded them, nor had it ever entered My mind, that they should commit such an abomination and cause Judah to sin.
12283	13	32	36	32	36	Now therefore, about this city of which you say, ‘It will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and famine and plague,’ this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
12284	13	32	37	32	37	I will surely gather My people from all the lands to which I have banished them in My furious anger and great wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them dwell in safety.
12285	13	32	38	32	38	They will be My people, and I will be their God.
12286	13	32	39	32	39	I will give them one heart and one way, so that they will always fear Me for their own good and for the good of their children after them.
12287	13	32	40	32	40	I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put My fear in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from Me.
12288	13	32	41	32	41	Yes, I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul.
12289	13	32	42	32	42	For this is what the LORD says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on this people, so I will bring on them all the good I have promised them.
12290	13	32	43	32	43	And fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation, without man or beast; it has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.’
12291	13	32	44	32	44	Fields will be purchased with silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah—the cities of the hill country, the foothills, and the Negev—because I will restore them from captivity, declares the LORD.”
12292	13	33	1	33	1	While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second time:
12293	13	33	2	33	2	“Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it and established it, the LORD is His name:
12294	13	33	3	33	3	‘Call to Me, and I will answer and show you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’
12295	13	33	4	33	4	For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah that have been torn down for defense against the siege ramps and the sword:
12296	13	33	5	33	5	The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill those places with the corpses of the men I will strike down in My anger and in My wrath. I have hidden My face from this city because of all its wickedness.
12297	13	33	6	33	6	Nevertheless, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal its people and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
12298	13	33	7	33	7	I will restore Judah and Israel from captivity and will rebuild them as in former times.
12299	13	33	8	33	8	And I will cleanse them from all the iniquity they have committed against Me, and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me.
12300	13	33	9	33	9	So this city will bring Me renown, joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good I do for it. They will tremble in awe because of all the goodness and prosperity that I will provide for it.
12301	13	33	10	33	10	This is what the LORD says: In this place you say is a wasteland without man or beast, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted—inhabited by neither man nor beast—there will be heard again
12302	13	33	11	33	11	the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those bringing thank offerings into the house of the LORD, saying: ‘Give thanks to the LORD of Hosts, for the LORD is good; His loving devotion endures forever.’ For I will restore the land from captivity as in former times, says the LORD.
12303	13	33	12	33	12	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: In this desolate place, without man or beast, and in all its cities, there will once more be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
12304	13	33	13	33	13	In the cities of the hill country, the foothills, and the Negev, in the land of Benjamin and the cities surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
12305	13	33	14	33	14	Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will fulfill the gracious promise that I have spoken to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
12306	13	33	15	33	15	In those days and at that time I will cause to sprout for David a righteous Branch, and He will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
12307	13	33	16	33	16	In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely, and this is the name by which it will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness.
12308	13	33	17	33	17	For this is what the LORD says: David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
12309	13	33	18	33	18	nor will the priests who are Levites ever fail to have a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices.”
12310	13	33	19	33	19	And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12311	13	33	20	33	20	“This is what the LORD says: If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night cease to occupy their appointed time,
12312	13	33	21	33	21	then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant and with My ministers the Levites who are priests, so that David will not have a son to reign on his throne.
12313	13	33	22	33	22	As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted and as the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so too will I multiply the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who minister before Me.”
12314	13	33	23	33	23	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12315	13	33	24	33	24	“Have you not noticed what these people are saying: ‘The LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen’? So they despise My people and no longer regard them as a nation.
12316	13	33	25	33	25	This is what the LORD says: If I have not established My covenant with the day and the night and the fixed order of heaven and earth,
12317	13	33	26	33	26	then I would also reject the descendants of Jacob and of My servant David, so as not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from captivity and will have compassion on them.”
12318	13	34	1	34	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, all his army, all the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all the other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities:
12319	13	34	2	34	2	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go, speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him that this is what the LORD says: Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.
12320	13	34	3	34	3	And you yourself will not escape his grasp, but will surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You will see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak to him face to face; and you will go to Babylon.
12321	13	34	4	34	4	Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;
12322	13	34	5	34	5	you will die in peace. As spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who preceded you, so people will burn spices for you and lament, ‘Alas, O master!’ For I Myself have spoken this word, declares the LORD.”
12323	13	34	6	34	6	In Jerusalem, then, Jeremiah the prophet relayed all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah
12324	13	34	7	34	7	as the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the remaining cities of Judah—against Lachish and Azekah. For these were the only fortified cities remaining in Judah.
12325	13	34	8	34	8	After King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty, the word came to Jeremiah from the LORD
12326	13	34	9	34	9	that each man should free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female, and no one should hold his fellow Jew in bondage.
12327	13	34	10	34	10	So all the officials and all the people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their menservants and maidservants and no longer hold them in bondage. They obeyed and released them,
12328	13	34	11	34	11	but later they changed their minds and took back the menservants and maidservants they had freed, and they forced them to become slaves again.
12329	13	34	12	34	12	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
12330	13	34	13	34	13	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying:
12331	13	34	14	34	14	Every seventh year, each of you must free his Hebrew brother who has sold himself to you. He may serve you six years, but then you must let him go free. But your fathers did not listen or incline their ear.
12332	13	34	15	34	15	Recently you repented and did what pleased Me; each of you proclaimed freedom for his neighbor. You made a covenant before Me in the house that bears My Name.
12333	13	34	16	34	16	But now you have changed your minds and profaned My name. Each of you has taken back the menservants and maidservants whom you had set at liberty to go wherever they wanted, and you have again forced them to be your slaves.
12334	13	34	17	34	17	Therefore this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed Me; you have not proclaimed freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. So now I proclaim freedom for you, declares the LORD—freedom to fall by sword, by plague, and by famine! I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
12335	13	34	18	34	18	And those who have transgressed My covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before Me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two in order to pass between its pieces.
12336	13	34	19	34	19	The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf,
12337	13	34	20	34	20	I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
12338	13	34	21	34	21	And I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon that had withdrawn from you.
12339	13	34	22	34	22	Behold, I am going to give the command, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
12340	13	35	1	35	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
12341	13	35	2	35	2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the house of the LORD to offer them a drink of wine.”
12342	13	35	3	35	3	So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the entire house of the Rechabites—
12343	13	35	4	35	4	and I brought them into the house of the LORD, to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
12344	13	35	5	35	5	Then I set pitchers full of wine and some cups before the men of the house of the Rechabites, and I said to them, “Drink some wine.”
12345	13	35	6	35	6	“We do not drink wine,” they replied, “for our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘Neither you nor your descendants are ever to drink wine.
12346	13	35	7	35	7	Nor are you ever to build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not for you. Instead, you must live in tents all your lives, so that you may live a long time in the land where you wander.’
12347	13	35	8	35	8	And we have obeyed the voice of our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab in all he commanded us. So we have not drunk wine all our lives—neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters.
12348	13	35	9	35	9	Nor have we built houses in which to live, and we have not owned any vineyards or fields or crops.
12349	13	35	10	35	10	But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done exactly as our forefather Jonadab commanded us.
12350	13	35	11	35	11	So when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land, we said: ‘Come, let us go into Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldeans and the Arameans.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”
12351	13	35	12	35	12	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12352	13	35	13	35	13	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: ‘Will you not accept discipline and obey My words?’ declares the LORD.
12353	13	35	14	35	14	The words of Jonadab son of Rechab have been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk it to this very day because they have obeyed the command of their forefather. But I have spoken to you again and again, and you have not obeyed Me!
12354	13	35	15	35	15	Again and again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: ‘Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways, and correct your actions. Do not go after other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I have given to you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me.
12355	13	35	16	35	16	Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not listened to Me.
12356	13	35	17	35	17	Therefore this is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’”
12357	13	35	18	35	18	Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab and have kept all his commandments and have done all that he charged you to do,
12358	13	35	19	35	19	this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand before Me.’”
12359	13	36	1	36	1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
12360	13	36	2	36	2	“Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you during the reign of Josiah until today.
12361	13	36	3	36	3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the calamity I plan to bring upon them, each of them will turn from his wicked way. Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
12362	13	36	4	36	4	So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and at the dictation of Jeremiah, Baruch wrote on a scroll all the words that the LORD had spoken to Jeremiah.
12363	13	36	5	36	5	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I am restricted; I cannot enter the house of the LORD;
12364	13	36	6	36	6	so you are to go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting, and in the hearing of the people you are to read the words of the LORD from the scroll you have written at my dictation. Read them in the hearing of all the people of Judah who are coming from their cities.
12365	13	36	7	36	7	Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each one will turn from his wicked way; for great are the anger and fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
12366	13	36	8	36	8	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. In the house of the LORD he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
12367	13	36	9	36	9	Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a fast before the LORD was proclaimed to all the people of Jerusalem and all who had come there from the cities of Judah.
12368	13	36	10	36	10	From the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, which was in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the house of the LORD, Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the hearing of all the people.
12369	13	36	11	36	11	When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
12370	13	36	12	36	12	he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the king’s palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
12371	13	36	13	36	13	And Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
12372	13	36	14	36	14	Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, saying, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come here.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them.
12373	13	36	15	36	15	“Please sit down,” they said, “and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing.
12374	13	36	16	36	16	When they had heard all these words, they turned to each other in fear and said to Baruch, “Surely we must report all these words to the king.”
12375	13	36	17	36	17	“Tell us now,” they asked Baruch, “how did you write all these words? Was it at Jeremiah’s dictation?”
12376	13	36	18	36	18	“It was at his dictation,” Baruch replied. “He recited all these words to me and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”
12377	13	36	19	36	19	Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must hide yourselves and tell no one where you are.”
12378	13	36	20	36	20	So the officials went to the king in the courtyard. And having stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, they reported everything to the king.
12379	13	36	21	36	21	Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing beside him.
12380	13	36	22	36	22	Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters with a fire burning before him.
12381	13	36	23	36	23	And as soon as Jehudi had read three or four columns, Jehoiakim would cut them off with a scribe’s knife and throw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll had been consumed by the fire.
12382	13	36	24	36	24	Yet in hearing all these words, the king and his servants did not become frightened or tear their garments.
12383	13	36	25	36	25	Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
12384	13	36	26	36	26	Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, as well as Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.
12385	13	36	27	36	27	After the king had burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
12386	13	36	28	36	28	“Take another scroll and rewrite on it the very words that were on the original scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned.
12387	13	36	29	36	29	You are to proclaim concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah that this is what the LORD says: You have burned the scroll and said, ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon would surely come and destroy this land and deprive it of man and beast?’
12388	13	36	30	36	30	Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David’s throne, and his body will be thrown out to be exposed to heat by day and frost by night.
12389	13	36	31	36	31	I will punish him and his descendants and servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the calamity about which I warned them but they did not listen.”
12390	13	36	32	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and at Jeremiah’s dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
12391	13	37	1	37	1	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made Zedekiah son of Josiah the king of Judah, and he reigned in place of Coniah son of Jehoiakim.
12392	13	37	2	37	2	But he and his officers and the people of the land refused to obey the words that the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
12393	13	37	3	37	3	Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet with the message, “Please pray to the LORD our God for us!”
12394	13	37	4	37	4	Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.
12395	13	37	5	37	5	Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
12396	13	37	6	37	6	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
12397	13	37	7	37	7	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says that you are to tell the king of Judah, who sent you to Me: ‘Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to help you, will go back to its own land of Egypt.
12398	13	37	8	37	8	Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it down.’
12399	13	37	9	37	9	This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves by saying, ‘The Chaldeans will go away for good,’ for they will not!
12400	13	37	10	37	10	Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans that is fighting against you, and only wounded men remained in their tents, they would still get up and burn this city down.”
12401	13	37	11	37	11	When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,
12402	13	37	12	37	12	Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people.
12403	13	37	13	37	13	But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, seized him and said, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!”
12404	13	37	14	37	14	“That is a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials.
12405	13	37	15	37	15	The officials were angry with Jeremiah, and they beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison.
12406	13	37	16	37	16	So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and remained there a long time.
12407	13	37	17	37	17	Later, King Zedekiah sent for him and received him, and in his palace he privately asked, “Is there a word from the LORD?” “There is,” Jeremiah replied. “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
12408	13	37	18	37	18	Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people, that you have put me in prison?
12409	13	37	19	37	19	Where are your prophets, who prophesied to you, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or this land’?
12410	13	37	20	37	20	But now please listen, O my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”
12411	13	37	21	37	21	So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
12412	13	38	1	38	1	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was telling all the people:
12413	13	38	2	38	2	“This is what the LORD says: Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live. He will escape with his life as a reward, and he will live.
12414	13	38	3	38	3	This is what the LORD says: This city will surely be delivered into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.”
12415	13	38	4	38	4	Then the officials said to the king, “This man ought to die, for he is discouraging the warriors who remain in this city, as well as all the people, by speaking such words to them; this man is not seeking the well-being of these people, but their ruin.”
12416	13	38	5	38	5	“Here he is,” replied King Zedekiah. “He is in your hands, since the king can do nothing to stop you.”
12417	13	38	6	38	6	So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah with ropes into the cistern, which had no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
12418	13	38	7	38	7	Now Ebed-melech the Cushite, a court official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin,
12419	13	38	8	38	8	Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and said to the king,
12420	13	38	9	38	9	“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the cistern, where he will starve to death, for there is no more bread in the city.”
12421	13	38	10	38	10	So the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and pull Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
12422	13	38	11	38	11	Then Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the king’s palace, to a place below the storehouse. From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
12423	13	38	12	38	12	Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah, “Put these worn-out rags and clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,
12424	13	38	13	38	13	and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
12425	13	38	14	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD. “I am going to ask you something,” said the king to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”
12426	13	38	15	38	15	“If I tell you,” Jeremiah replied, “you will surely put me to death. And even if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
12427	13	38	16	38	16	But King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us this life, I will not kill you, nor will I deliver you into the hands of these men who are seeking your life.”
12428	13	38	17	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you indeed surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will survive.
12429	13	38	18	38	18	But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape their grasp.’”
12430	13	38	19	38	19	But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for the Chaldeans may deliver me into their hands to abuse me.”
12431	13	38	20	38	20	“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the voice of the LORD in what I am telling you, that it may go well with you and you may live.
12432	13	38	21	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the LORD has shown me:
12433	13	38	22	38	22	All the women who remain in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon, and those women will say: ‘They misled you and overcame you—those trusted friends of yours. Your feet sank into the mire, and they deserted you.’
12434	13	38	23	38	23	All your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans. And you yourself will not escape their grasp, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.”
12435	13	38	24	38	24	Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you will die.
12436	13	38	25	38	25	If the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come and demand of you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you; do not hide it from us, or we will kill you,’
12437	13	38	26	38	26	then tell them, ‘I was presenting to the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
12438	13	38	27	38	27	When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he relayed to them the exact words the king had commanded him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had overheard the conversation.
12439	13	38	28	38	28	And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
12440	13	39	1	39	1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to the city.
12441	13	39	2	39	2	And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city was broken through.
12442	13	39	3	39	3	Then all the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
12443	13	39	4	39	4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and they went out along the route to the Arabah.
12444	13	39	5	39	5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him.
12445	13	39	6	39	6	There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed all the nobles of Judah.
12446	13	39	7	39	7	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
12447	13	39	8	39	8	The Chaldeans set fire to the palace of the king and to the houses of the people, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
12448	13	39	9	39	9	Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried away to Babylon the remnant of the people who had remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to him.
12449	13	39	10	39	10	But Nebuzaradan left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who had no property, and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
12450	13	39	11	39	11	Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, saying,
12451	13	39	12	39	12	“Take him, look after him, and do not let any harm come to him; do for him whatever he says.”
12452	13	39	13	39	13	So Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon
12453	13	39	14	39	14	had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guard, and they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So Jeremiah remained among his own people.
12454	13	39	15	39	15	And while Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD had come to him:
12455	13	39	16	39	16	“Go and tell Ebed-melech the Cushite that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill My words against this city for harm and not for good, and on that day they will be fulfilled before your eyes.
12456	13	39	17	39	17	But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you will not be delivered into the hands of the men whom you fear.
12457	13	39	18	39	18	For I will surely rescue you so that you do not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in Me, you will escape with your life like a spoil of war, declares the LORD.”
12458	13	40	1	40	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had released him at Ramah, having found him bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
12459	13	40	2	40	2	The captain of the guard found Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place,
12460	13	40	3	40	3	and now the LORD has fulfilled it; He has done just as He said. Because you people have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed His voice, this thing has happened to you.
12461	13	40	4	40	4	But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains that were on your wrists. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look, the whole land is before you. Wherever it seems good and right to you, go there.”
12462	13	40	5	40	5	But before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go anywhere else that seems right.” Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him.
12463	13	40	6	40	6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.
12464	13	40	7	40	7	When all the commanders and men of the armies in the field heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children who were the poorest of the land and had not been exiled to Babylon,
12465	13	40	8	40	8	they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite—they and their men.
12466	13	40	9	40	9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.
12467	13	40	10	40	10	As for me, I will stay in Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine grapes, summer fruit, and oil, place them in your storage jars, and live in the cities you have taken.”
12468	13	40	11	40	11	When all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them,
12469	13	40	12	40	12	they all returned from all the places to which they had been banished and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered an abundance of wine grapes and summer fruit.
12470	13	40	13	40	13	Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
12471	13	40	14	40	14	and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
12472	13	40	15	40	15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah at Mizpah. “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah,” he said. “No one will know it. Why should he take your life and scatter all the people of Judah who have gathered to you, so that the remnant of Judah would perish?”
12473	13	40	16	40	16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
12474	13	41	1	41	1	In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family and one of the king’s chief officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and they ate a meal together there.
12475	13	41	2	41	2	Then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land.
12476	13	41	3	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
12477	13	41	4	41	4	On the second day after the murder of Gedaliah, when no one yet knew about it,
12478	13	41	5	41	5	eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their garments, and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, carrying grain offerings and frankincense for the house of the LORD.
12479	13	41	6	41	6	And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When Ishmael encountered the men, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”
12480	13	41	7	41	7	And when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
12481	13	41	8	41	8	But ten of the men among them said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field—wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he refrained from killing them with the others.
12482	13	41	9	41	9	Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men he had struck down along with Gedaliah was a large one that King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
12483	13	41	10	41	10	Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah—the daughters of the king along with all the others who remained in Mizpah—over whom Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.
12484	13	41	11	41	11	When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him heard of all the crimes that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed,
12485	13	41	12	41	12	they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. And they found him near the great pool in Gibeon.
12486	13	41	13	41	13	When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him, they rejoiced,
12487	13	41	14	41	14	and all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.
12488	13	41	15	41	15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and went to the Ammonites.
12489	13	41	16	41	16	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him took the whole remnant of the people from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam: the soldiers, women, children, and court officials he had brought back from Gibeon.
12490	13	41	17	41	17	And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt
12491	13	41	18	41	18	to escape the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of the Chaldeans because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
12492	13	42	1	42	1	Then all the commanders of the forces, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached
12493	13	42	2	42	2	Jeremiah the prophet and said, “May our petition come before you; pray to the LORD your God on behalf of this entire remnant. For few of us remain of the many, as you can see with your own eyes.
12494	13	42	3	42	3	Pray that the LORD your God will tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do.”
12495	13	42	4	42	4	“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will surely pray to the LORD your God as you request, and I will tell you everything that the LORD answers; I will not withhold a word from you.”
12496	13	42	5	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act upon every word that the LORD your God sends you to tell us.
12497	13	42	6	42	6	Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us, for we will obey the voice of the LORD our God!”
12498	13	42	7	42	7	After ten days, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,
12499	13	42	8	42	8	and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
12500	13	42	9	42	9	Jeremiah told them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition:
12501	13	42	10	42	10	If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I will relent of the disaster I have brought upon you.
12502	13	42	11	42	11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear; do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.
12503	13	42	12	42	12	And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own land.
12504	13	42	13	42	13	But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and you thus disobey the voice of the LORD your God,
12505	13	42	14	42	14	and if you say, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt and live there, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram’s horn or hunger for bread,’
12506	13	42	15	42	15	then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah! This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: If you are determined to go to Egypt and reside there,
12507	13	42	16	42	16	then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow on your heels into Egypt, and you will die there.
12508	13	42	17	42	17	So all who resolve to go to Egypt to reside there will die by sword and famine and plague. Not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them.
12509	13	42	18	42	18	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as My anger and wrath were poured out on the residents of Jerusalem, so will My wrath be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and disgrace, and you will never see this place again.’
12510	13	42	19	42	19	The LORD has told you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Know for sure that I have warned you today!
12511	13	42	20	42	20	For you have deceived yourselves by sending me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray to the LORD our God on our behalf, and as for all that the LORD our God says, tell it to us and we will do it.’
12512	13	42	21	42	21	For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in all He has sent me to tell you.
12513	13	42	22	42	22	Now therefore, know for sure that by sword and famine and plague you will die in the place where you desire to go to reside.”
12514	13	43	1	43	1	When Jeremiah had finished telling all the people all the words of the LORD their God—everything that the LORD had sent him to say—
12515	13	43	2	43	2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to reside there.’
12516	13	43	3	43	3	Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, so that they may put us to death or exile us to Babylon!”
12517	13	43	4	43	4	So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces disobeyed the command of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah.
12518	13	43	5	43	5	Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned to the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been scattered,
12519	13	43	6	43	6	the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
12520	13	43	7	43	7	So they entered the land of Egypt because they did not obey the voice of the LORD, and they went as far as Tahpanhes.
12521	13	43	8	43	8	Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
12522	13	43	9	43	9	“In the sight of the Jews, pick up some large stones and bury them in the clay of the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes.
12523	13	43	10	43	10	Then tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones that I have embedded, and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.
12524	13	43	11	43	11	He will come and strike down the land of Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.
12525	13	43	12	43	12	I will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar will burn those temples and take their gods as captives. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment, and he will depart from there unscathed.
12526	13	43	13	43	13	He will demolish the sacred pillars of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’”
12527	13	44	1	44	1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis—and in the land of Pathros:
12528	13	44	2	44	2	“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disaster that I brought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, they lie today in ruins and desolation
12529	13	44	3	44	3	because of the evil they have done. They provoked Me to anger by continuing to burn incense and to serve other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew.
12530	13	44	4	44	4	Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying: ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate.’
12531	13	44	5	44	5	But they did not listen or incline their ears; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.
12532	13	44	6	44	6	Therefore My wrath and anger poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so that they have become the desolate ruin they are today.
12533	13	44	7	44	7	So now, this is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves by cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, leaving yourselves without a remnant?
12534	13	44	8	44	8	Why are you provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to reside? As a result, you will be cut off and will become an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the earth.
12535	13	44	9	44	9	Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and of the kings of Judah and their wives, as well as the wickedness that you and your wives committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
12536	13	44	10	44	10	To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed My instruction or the statutes that I set before you and your fathers.
12537	13	44	11	44	11	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will set My face to bring disaster and to cut off all Judah.
12538	13	44	12	44	12	And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to reside there; they will meet their end. They will all fall by the sword or be consumed by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine; and they will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and reproach.
12539	13	44	13	44	13	I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, by sword and famine and plague,
12540	13	44	14	44	14	so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone to reside in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, where they long to return and live; for none will return except a few fugitives.”
12541	13	44	15	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women standing by—a great assembly—along with all the people living in the land of Egypt and in Pathros, said to Jeremiah,
12542	13	44	16	44	16	“As for the word you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you!
12543	13	44	17	44	17	Instead, we will do everything we vowed to do: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and offer drink offerings to her, just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and good things, and we saw no disaster.
12544	13	44	18	44	18	But from the time we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing by sword and famine.”
12545	13	44	19	44	19	“Moreover,” said the women, “when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands’ knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”
12546	13	44	20	44	20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,
12547	13	44	21	44	21	“As for the incense you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—did the LORD not remember and bring this to mind?
12548	13	44	22	44	22	So the LORD could no longer endure the evil deeds and detestable acts you committed, and your land became a desolation, a horror, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as it is today.
12549	13	44	23	44	23	Because you burned incense and sinned against the LORD, and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in His instruction, His statutes, and His testimonies, this disaster has befallen you, as you see today.”
12550	13	44	24	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
12551	13	44	25	44	25	This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands your words: ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Go ahead, then, do what you have promised! Keep your vows!
12552	13	44	26	44	26	Nevertheless, hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah living in Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD, that never again will any man of Judah living in the land of Egypt invoke My name or say, ‘As surely as the Lord GOD lives.’
12553	13	44	27	44	27	I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine, until they are finished off.
12554	13	44	28	44	28	Those who escape the sword will return from Egypt to Judah, few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah who went to dwell in the land of Egypt will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs!
12555	13	44	29	44	29	This will be a sign to you that I will punish you in this place, declares the LORD, so that you may know that My threats of harm against you will surely stand.
12556	13	44	30	44	30	This is what the LORD says: Behold, I will deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who seek his life, just as I delivered Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.”
12557	13	45	1	45	1	This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
12558	13	45	2	45	2	“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
12559	13	45	3	45	3	You have said, ‘Woe is me because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.’”
12560	13	45	4	45	4	Thus Jeremiah was to say to Baruch: “This is what the LORD says: Throughout the land I will demolish what I have built and uproot what I have planted.
12561	13	45	5	45	5	But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I will bring disaster on every living creature, declares the LORD, but wherever you go, I will grant your life as a spoil of war.”
12562	13	46	1	46	1	This is the word of the LORD about the nations—the word that came to Jeremiah the prophet
12563	13	46	2	46	2	concerning Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:
12564	13	46	3	46	3	“Deploy your shields, small and large; advance for battle!
12565	13	46	4	46	4	Harness the horses; mount the steeds; take your positions with helmets on! Polish your spears; put on armor!
12566	13	46	5	46	5	Why am I seeing this? They are terrified, they are retreating; their warriors are defeated, they flee in haste without looking back; terror is on every side!” declares the LORD.
12567	13	46	6	46	6	“The swift cannot flee, and the warrior cannot escape! In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall.
12568	13	46	7	46	7	Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters churn?
12569	13	46	8	46	8	Egypt rises like the Nile, and its waters churn like rivers, boasting, ‘I will rise and cover the earth; I will destroy the cities and their people.’
12570	13	46	9	46	9	Advance, O horses! Race furiously, O chariots! Let the warriors come forth—Cush and Put carrying their shields, men of Lydia drawing the bow.
12571	13	46	10	46	10	For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of Hosts, a day of vengeance against His foes. The sword will devour until it is satisfied, until it is quenched with their blood. For the Lord GOD of Hosts will hold a sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.
12572	13	46	11	46	11	Go up to Gilead for balm, O Virgin Daughter of Egypt! In vain you try many remedies, but for you there is no healing.
12573	13	46	12	46	12	The nations have heard of your shame, and your outcry fills the earth, because warrior stumbles over warrior and both of them have fallen together.”
12574	13	46	13	46	13	This is the word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
12575	13	46	14	46	14	“Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol; proclaim it in Memphis and Tahpanhes: ‘Take your positions and prepare yourself, for the sword devours those around you.’
12576	13	46	15	46	15	Why have your warriors been laid low? They cannot stand, for the LORD has thrust them down.
12577	13	46	16	46	16	They continue to stumble; indeed, they have fallen over one another. They say, ‘Get up! Let us return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword of the oppressor.’
12578	13	46	17	46	17	There they will cry out: ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise; he has let the appointed time pass him by.’
12579	13	46	18	46	18	As surely as I live, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of Hosts, will come one who is like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
12580	13	46	19	46	19	Pack your bags for exile, O daughter dwelling in Egypt! For Memphis will be laid waste, destroyed and uninhabited.
12581	13	46	20	46	20	Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly from the north is coming against her.
12582	13	46	21	46	21	Even the mercenaries among her are like fattened calves. They too will turn back; together they will flee, they will not stand their ground, for the day of their calamity is coming upon them—the time of their punishment.
12583	13	46	22	46	22	Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent, for the enemy will advance in force; with axes they will come against her like woodsmen cutting down trees.
12584	13	46	23	46	23	They will chop down her forest, declares the LORD, dense though it may be, for they are more numerous than locusts; they cannot be counted.
12585	13	46	24	46	24	The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame; she will be delivered into the hands of the people of the north.”
12586	13	46	25	46	25	The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I am about to punish Amon god of Thebes, along with Pharaoh, Egypt with her gods and kings, and those who trust in Pharaoh.
12587	13	46	26	46	26	I will deliver them into the hands of those who seek their lives—of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But after this, Egypt will be inhabited as in days of old, declares the LORD.
12588	13	46	27	46	27	But you, O Jacob My servant, do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed, O Israel, for surely I will save you from a distant place, and your descendants from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and be undisturbed and secure, with no one to make him afraid.
12589	13	46	28	46	28	And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid, declares the LORD, for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations to which I have banished you, but I will not make a full end of you. I will discipline you, but with justice; I will by no means leave you unpunished.”
12590	13	47	1	47	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before Pharaoh struck down Gaza.
12591	13	47	2	47	2	This is what the LORD says: “See how the waters are rising from the north and becoming an overflowing torrent. They will overflow the land and its fullness, the cities and their inhabitants. The people will cry out, and all who dwell in the land will wail
12592	13	47	3	47	3	at the sound of the galloping hooves of stallions, the rumbling of chariots, and the clatter of their wheels. The fathers will not turn back for their sons; their hands will hang limp.
12593	13	47	4	47	4	For the day has come to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. Indeed, the LORD is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor.
12594	13	47	5	47	5	The people of Gaza will shave their heads in mourning; Ashkelon will be silenced. O remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself?
12595	13	47	6	47	6	‘Alas, O sword of the LORD, how long until you rest? Return to your sheath; cease and be still!’
12596	13	47	7	47	7	How can it rest when the LORD has commanded it? He has appointed it against Ashkelon and the shore of its coastland.”
12597	13	48	1	48	1	Concerning Moab, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Woe to Nebo, for it will be devastated. Kiriathaim will be captured and disgraced; the fortress will be shattered and dismantled.
12598	13	48	2	48	2	There is no longer praise for Moab; in Heshbon they devise evil against her: ‘Come, let us cut her off from nationhood.’ You too, O people of Madmen, will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.
12599	13	48	3	48	3	A voice cries out from Horonaim: ‘Devastation and great destruction!’
12600	13	48	4	48	4	Moab will be shattered; her little ones will cry out.
12601	13	48	5	48	5	For on the ascent to Luhith they weep bitterly as they go, and on the descent to Horonaim cries of distress resound over the destruction:
12602	13	48	6	48	6	‘Flee! Run for your lives! Become like a juniper in the desert.’
12603	13	48	7	48	7	Because you trust in your works and treasures, you too will be captured, and Chemosh will go into exile with his priests and officials.
12604	13	48	8	48	8	The destroyer will move against every city, and not one town will escape. The valley will also be ruined, and the high plain will be destroyed, as the LORD has said.
12605	13	48	9	48	9	Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste; her cities will become desolate, with no one to dwell in them.
12606	13	48	10	48	10	Cursed is the one who is remiss in doing the work of the LORD, and cursed is he who withholds his sword from bloodshed.
12607	13	48	11	48	11	Moab has been at ease from youth, settled like wine on its dregs; he has not been poured from vessel to vessel or gone into exile. So his flavor has remained the same, and his aroma is unchanged.
12608	13	48	12	48	12	Therefore behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will send to him wanderers, who will pour him out. They will empty his vessels and shatter his jars.
12609	13	48	13	48	13	Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
12610	13	48	14	48	14	How can you say, ‘We are warriors, mighty men ready for battle’?
12611	13	48	15	48	15	Moab has been destroyed and its towns have been invaded; the best of its young men have gone down in the slaughter, declares the King, whose name is the LORD of Hosts.
12612	13	48	16	48	16	Moab’s calamity is at hand, and his affliction is rushing swiftly.
12613	13	48	17	48	17	Mourn for him, all you who surround him, everyone who knows his name; tell how the mighty scepter is shattered—the glorious staff!
12614	13	48	18	48	18	Come down from your glory; sit on parched ground, O daughter dwelling in Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has destroyed your fortresses.
12615	13	48	19	48	19	Stand by the road and watch, O dweller of Aroer! Ask the man fleeing or the woman escaping, ‘What has happened?’
12616	13	48	20	48	20	Moab is put to shame, for it has been shattered. Wail and cry out! Declare by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
12617	13	48	21	48	21	Judgment has come upon the high plain—upon Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath,
12618	13	48	22	48	22	upon Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
12619	13	48	23	48	23	upon Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,
12620	13	48	24	48	24	upon Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of Moab, those far and near.
12621	13	48	25	48	25	The horn of Moab has been cut off, and his arm is broken,” declares the LORD.
12622	13	48	26	48	26	“Make him drunk, because he has magnified himself against the LORD; so Moab will wallow in his own vomit, and he will also become a laughingstock.
12623	13	48	27	48	27	Was not Israel your object of ridicule? Was he ever found among thieves? For whenever you speak of him you shake your head.
12624	13	48	28	48	28	Abandon the towns and settle among the rocks, O dwellers of Moab! Be like a dove that nests at the mouth of a cave.
12625	13	48	29	48	29	We have heard of Moab’s pomposity, his exceeding pride and conceit, his proud arrogance and haughtiness of heart.
12626	13	48	30	48	30	I know his insolence,” declares the LORD, “but it is futile. His boasting is as empty as his deeds.
12627	13	48	31	48	31	Therefore I will wail for Moab; I will cry out for all of Moab; I will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
12628	13	48	32	48	32	I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah, more than I weep for Jazer. Your tendrils have extended to the sea; they reach even to Jazer. The destroyer has descended on your summer fruit and grape harvest.
12629	13	48	33	48	33	Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard and from the fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy; their shouts are not for joy.
12630	13	48	34	48	34	There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they raise their voices to Jahaz, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim have dried up.
12631	13	48	35	48	35	In Moab, declares the LORD, I will bring an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods.
12632	13	48	36	48	36	Therefore My heart laments like a flute for Moab; it laments like a flute for the men of Kir-heres, because the wealth they acquired has perished.
12633	13	48	37	48	37	For every head is shaved and every beard is clipped; on every hand is a gash, and around every waist is sackcloth.
12634	13	48	38	48	38	On all the rooftops of Moab and in the public squares, everyone is mourning; for I have shattered Moab like an unwanted jar,” declares the LORD.
12635	13	48	39	48	39	“How shattered it is! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around him.”
12636	13	48	40	48	40	For this is what the LORD says: “Behold, an eagle swoops down and spreads his wings against Moab.
12637	13	48	41	48	41	Kirioth has been taken, and the strongholds seized. In that day the heart of Moab’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
12638	13	48	42	48	42	Moab will be destroyed as a nation because he vaunted himself against the LORD.
12639	13	48	43	48	43	Terror, pit, and snare await you, O dweller of Moab,” declares the LORD.
12640	13	48	44	48	44	“He who flees the panic will fall into the pit, and he who climbs from the pit will be caught in the snare, for I will bring against Moab the year of their punishment, declares the LORD.
12641	13	48	45	48	45	Those who flee will stand helpless in Heshbon’s shadow, because fire has gone forth from Heshbon and a flame from within Sihon. It devours the foreheads of Moab and the skulls of the sons of tumult.
12642	13	48	46	48	46	Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished; for your sons have been taken into exile and your daughters have gone into captivity.
12643	13	48	47	48	47	Yet in the latter days I will restore Moab from captivity,” declares the LORD. Here ends the judgment on Moab.
12644	13	49	1	49	1	Concerning the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: “Has Israel no sons? Is he without heir? Why then has Milcom taken possession of Gad? Why have his people settled in their cities?
12645	13	49	2	49	2	Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a heap of ruins, and its villages will be burned. Then Israel will drive out their dispossessors, says the LORD.
12646	13	49	3	49	3	Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed; cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run back and forth within your walls, for Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials.
12647	13	49	4	49	4	Why do you boast of your valleys, your valleys so fruitful, O faithless daughter? You trust in your riches and say, ‘Who can come against me?’
12648	13	49	5	49	5	Behold, I am about to bring terror upon you, declares the Lord GOD of Hosts, from all those around you. You will each be driven headlong, with no one to regather the fugitives.
12649	13	49	6	49	6	Yet afterward I will restore the Ammonites from captivity,” declares the LORD.
12650	13	49	7	49	7	Concerning Edom, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed?
12651	13	49	8	49	8	Turn and run! Lie low, O dwellers of Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him.
12652	13	49	9	49	9	If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings? Were thieves to come in the night, would they not steal only what they wanted?
12653	13	49	10	49	10	But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, and he will be unable to conceal himself. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors, and he will be no more.
12654	13	49	11	49	11	Abandon your orphans; I will preserve their lives. Let your widows trust in Me.”
12655	13	49	12	49	12	For this is what the LORD says: “If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, can you possibly remain unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you must drink it too.
12656	13	49	13	49	13	For by Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse, and all her cities will be in ruins forever.”
12657	13	49	14	49	14	I have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent to the nations: “Assemble yourselves to march against her! Rise up for battle!”
12658	13	49	15	49	15	“For behold, I will make you small among nations, despised among men.
12659	13	49	16	49	16	The terror you cause and the pride of your heart have deceived you, O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks, O occupiers of the mountain summit. Though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down,” declares the LORD.
12660	13	49	17	49	17	“Edom will become an object of horror. Everyone who passes by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds.
12661	13	49	18	49	18	As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,” says the LORD, “no one will dwell there; no man will abide there.
12662	13	49	19	49	19	Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture. Indeed, I will chase Edom from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? And what shepherd can stand against Me?”
12663	13	49	20	49	20	Therefore hear the plans that the LORD has made against Edom and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman: Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away, and their pasture will be made desolate because of them.
12664	13	49	21	49	21	At the sound of their fall, the earth will quake; their cry will resound to the Red Sea.
12665	13	49	22	49	22	Look! An eagle will soar, then swoop down and spread its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
12666	13	49	23	49	23	Concerning Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard a bad report; they are agitated like the sea; their anxiety cannot be calmed.
12667	13	49	24	49	24	Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee. Panic has gripped her; anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor.
12668	13	49	25	49	25	How is the city of praise not forsaken, the town that brings Me joy?
12669	13	49	26	49	26	For her young men will fall in her streets; all the warriors will be silenced in that day,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
12670	13	49	27	49	27	“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; it will consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad.”
12671	13	49	28	49	28	Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated, this is what the LORD says: “Rise up, advance against Kedar, and destroy the people of the east!
12672	13	49	29	49	29	They will take their tents and flocks, their tent curtains and all their goods. They will take their camels for themselves. They will shout to them: ‘Terror is on every side!’
12673	13	49	30	49	30	Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, O residents of Hazor,” declares the LORD, “for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you.
12674	13	49	31	49	31	Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, one that dwells securely,” declares the LORD. “They have no gates or bars; they live alone.
12675	13	49	32	49	32	Their camels will become plunder, and their large herds will be spoil. I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples; I will bring calamity on them from all sides,” declares the LORD.
12676	13	49	33	49	33	“Hazor will become a haunt for jackals, a desolation forever. No one will dwell there; no man will abide there.”
12677	13	49	34	49	34	This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
12678	13	49	35	49	35	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold, I will shatter Elam’s bow, the mainstay of their might.
12679	13	49	36	49	36	I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will not be a nation to which Elam’s exiles will not go.
12680	13	49	37	49	37	So I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who seek their lives. I will bring disaster upon them, even My fierce anger,” declares the LORD. “I will send out the sword after them until I finish them off.
12681	13	49	38	49	38	I will set My throne in Elam, and destroy its king and officials,” declares the LORD.
12682	13	49	39	49	39	“Yet in the last days, I will restore Elam from captivity,” declares the LORD.
12683	13	50	1	50	1	This is the word that the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans:
12684	13	50	2	50	2	“Announce and declare to the nations; lift up a banner and proclaim it; hold nothing back when you say, ‘Babylon is captured; Bel is put to shame; Marduk is shattered, her images are disgraced, her idols are broken in pieces.’
12685	13	50	3	50	3	For a nation from the north will come against her; it will make her land a desolation. No one will live in it; both man and beast will flee.”
12686	13	50	4	50	4	“In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, the children of Israel and the children of Judah will come together, weeping as they come, and will seek the LORD their God.
12687	13	50	5	50	5	They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and join themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
12688	13	50	6	50	6	My people are lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, causing them to roam the mountains. They have wandered from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.
12689	13	50	7	50	7	All who found them devoured them, and their enemies said, ‘We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.’
12690	13	50	8	50	8	Flee from the midst of Babylon; depart from the land of the Chaldeans; be like the he-goats that lead the flock.
12691	13	50	9	50	9	For behold, I stir up and bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north. They will line up against her; from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed.
12692	13	50	10	50	10	Chaldea will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,” declares the LORD.
12693	13	50	11	50	11	“Because you rejoice, because you sing in triumph—you who plunder My inheritance—because you frolic like a heifer treading grain and neigh like stallions,
12694	13	50	12	50	12	your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who bore you will be disgraced. Behold, she will be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
12695	13	50	13	50	13	Because of the wrath of the LORD, she will not be inhabited; she will become completely desolate. All who pass through Babylon will be horrified and will hiss at all her wounds.
12696	13	50	14	50	14	Line up in formation around Babylon, all you who draw the bow! Shoot at her! Spare no arrows! For she has sinned against the LORD.
12697	13	50	15	50	15	Raise a war cry against her on every side! She has thrown up her hands in surrender; her towers have fallen; her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, take out your vengeance upon her; as she has done, do the same to her.
12698	13	50	16	50	16	Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time. In the face of the oppressor’s sword, each will turn to his own people, each will flee to his own land.
12699	13	50	17	50	17	Israel is a scattered flock, chased away by lions. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria; the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”
12700	13	50	18	50	18	Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.
12701	13	50	19	50	19	I will return Israel to his pasture, and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; his soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.
12702	13	50	20	50	20	In those days and at that time, declares the LORD, a search will be made for Israel’s guilt, but there will be none, and for Judah’s sins, but they will not be found; for I will forgive the remnant I preserve.”
12703	13	50	21	50	21	“Go up against the land of Merathaim, and against the residents of Pekod. Put them to the sword and devote them to destruction. Do all that I have commanded you,” declares the LORD.
12704	13	50	22	50	22	“The noise of battle is in the land—the noise of great destruction.
12705	13	50	23	50	23	How the hammer of the whole earth lies broken and shattered! What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
12706	13	50	24	50	24	I laid a snare for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it. You were found and captured because you challenged the LORD.
12707	13	50	25	50	25	The LORD has opened His armory and brought out His weapons of wrath, for this is the work of the Lord GOD of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
12708	13	50	26	50	26	Come against her from the farthest border. Break open her granaries; pile her up like mounds of grain. Devote her to destruction; leave her no survivors.
12709	13	50	27	50	27	Put all her young bulls to the sword; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come—the time of their punishment.
12710	13	50	28	50	28	Listen to the fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon, declaring in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance for His temple.
12711	13	50	29	50	29	Summon the archers against Babylon, all who string the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
12712	13	50	30	50	30	Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will perish in that day,” declares the LORD.
12713	13	50	31	50	31	“Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts, “for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
12714	13	50	32	50	32	The arrogant one will stumble and fall with no one to pick him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities to consume all those around him.”
12715	13	50	33	50	33	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “The sons of Israel are oppressed, and the sons of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to release them.
12716	13	50	34	50	34	Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of Hosts is His name. He will fervently plead their case so that He may bring rest to the earth, but turmoil to those who live in Babylon.
12717	13	50	35	50	35	A sword is against the Chaldeans, declares the LORD, against those who live in Babylon, and against her officials and wise men.
12718	13	50	36	50	36	A sword is against her false prophets, and they will become fools. A sword is against her warriors, and they will be filled with terror.
12719	13	50	37	50	37	A sword is against her horses and chariots and against all the foreigners in her midst, and they will become like women. A sword is against her treasuries, and they will be plundered.
12720	13	50	38	50	38	A drought is upon her waters, and they will be dried up. For it is a land of graven images, and the people go mad over idols.
12721	13	50	39	50	39	So the desert creatures and hyenas will live there and ostriches will dwell there. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.
12722	13	50	40	50	40	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,” declares the LORD, “no one will dwell there; no man will abide there.
12723	13	50	41	50	41	Behold! A people comes from the north. A great nation and many kings are stirred up from the remote regions of the earth.
12724	13	50	42	50	42	They grasp the bow and javelin. They are cruel and without mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, O Daughter of Babylon.
12725	13	50	43	50	43	The king of Babylon has heard the report, and his hands hang limp. Distress has seized him, pain like that of a woman in labor.
12726	13	50	44	50	44	Behold, one will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture. For in an instant I will chase Babylon from her land. Who is the chosen one I will appoint over her? For who is like Me, and who can challenge Me? What shepherd can stand against Me?”
12727	13	50	45	50	45	Therefore, hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Babylon and the strategies He has devised against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away; certainly their pasture will be made desolate because of them.
12728	13	50	46	50	46	At the sound of Babylon’s capture the earth will quake; a cry will be heard among the nations.
12729	13	51	1	51	1	This is what the LORD says: “Behold, I will stir up against Babylon and against the people of Leb-kamai the spirit of a destroyer.
12730	13	51	2	51	2	I will send strangers to Babylon to winnow her and empty her land; for they will come against her from every side in the day of her disaster.
12731	13	51	3	51	3	Do not let the archer bend his bow or put on his armor. Do not spare her young men; devote all her army to destruction!
12732	13	51	4	51	4	And they will fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and pierced through in her streets.
12733	13	51	5	51	5	For Israel and Judah have not been abandoned by their God, the LORD of Hosts, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel.”
12734	13	51	6	51	6	Flee from Babylon! Escape with your lives! Do not be destroyed in her punishment. For this is the time of the LORD’s vengeance; He will pay her what she deserves.
12735	13	51	7	51	7	Babylon was a gold cup in the hand of the LORD, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore the nations have gone mad.
12736	13	51	8	51	8	Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been shattered. Wail for her; get her balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed.
12737	13	51	9	51	9	“We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed. Abandon her! Let each of us go to his own land, for her judgment extends to the sky and reaches to the clouds.”
12738	13	51	10	51	10	The LORD has brought forth our vindication; come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has accomplished.
12739	13	51	11	51	11	Sharpen the arrows! Fill the quivers! The LORD has aroused the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because His plan is aimed at Babylon to destroy her, for it is the vengeance of the LORD—vengeance for His temple.
12740	13	51	12	51	12	Raise a banner against the walls of Babylon; post the guard; station the watchmen; prepare the ambush. For the LORD has both devised and accomplished what He spoke against the people of Babylon.
12741	13	51	13	51	13	You who dwell by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come; the thread of your life is cut.
12742	13	51	14	51	14	The LORD of Hosts has sworn by Himself: “Surely I will fill you up with men like locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you.”
12743	13	51	15	51	15	He made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
12744	13	51	16	51	16	When He thunders, the waters in the heavens roar, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
12745	13	51	17	51	17	Every man is senseless and devoid of knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his molten images are a lie, and there is no breath in them.
12746	13	51	18	51	18	They are worthless, a work to be mocked. In the time of their punishment they will perish.
12747	13	51	19	51	19	Jacob’s Portion is not like these, for He is the Maker of all things, and of the tribe of His inheritance—the LORD of Hosts is His name.
12748	13	51	20	51	20	“You are My war club, My weapon for battle. With you I shatter nations; with you I bring kingdoms to ruin.
12749	13	51	21	51	21	With you I shatter the horse and rider; with you I shatter the chariot and driver.
12750	13	51	22	51	22	With you I shatter man and woman; with you I shatter the old man and the youth; with you I shatter the young man and the maiden.
12751	13	51	23	51	23	With you I shatter the shepherd and his flock; with you I shatter the farmer and his oxen; with you I shatter the governors and officials.
12752	13	51	24	51	24	Before your very eyes I will repay Babylon and all the dwellers of Chaldea for all the evil they have done in Zion,” declares the LORD.
12753	13	51	25	51	25	“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, you who devastate the whole earth, declares the LORD. I will stretch out My hand against you; I will roll you over the cliffs and turn you into a charred mountain.
12754	13	51	26	51	26	No one shall retrieve from you a cornerstone or a foundation stone, because you will become desolate forever,” declares the LORD.
12755	13	51	27	51	27	“Raise a banner in the land! Blow the ram’s horn among the nations! Prepare the nations against her. Summon the kingdoms against her—Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a captain against her; bring up horses like swarming locusts.
12756	13	51	28	51	28	Prepare the nations for battle against her—the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the lands they rule.
12757	13	51	29	51	29	The earth quakes and writhes because the LORD’s intentions against Babylon stand: to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without an inhabitant.
12758	13	51	30	51	30	The warriors of Babylon have stopped fighting; they sit in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become like women. Babylon’s homes have been set ablaze, the bars of her gates are broken.
12759	13	51	31	51	31	One courier races to meet another, and messenger follows messenger, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured from end to end.
12760	13	51	32	51	32	The fords have been seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers are terrified.”
12761	13	51	33	51	33	For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled. In just a little while her harvest time will come.”
12762	13	51	34	51	34	“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me. He has set me aside like an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a monster; he filled his belly with my delicacies and vomited me out.
12763	13	51	35	51	35	May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,” says the dweller of Zion. “May my blood be on the dwellers of Chaldea,” says Jerusalem.
12764	13	51	36	51	36	Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance on your behalf; I will dry up her sea and make her springs run dry.
12765	13	51	37	51	37	Babylon will become a heap of rubble, a haunt for jackals, an object of horror and scorn, without inhabitant.
12766	13	51	38	51	38	They will roar together like young lions; they will growl like lion cubs.
12767	13	51	39	51	39	While they are flushed with heat, I will serve them a feast, and I will make them drunk so that they may revel; then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up, declares the LORD.
12768	13	51	40	51	40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.
12769	13	51	41	51	41	How Sheshach has been captured! The praise of all the earth has been seized. What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
12770	13	51	42	51	42	The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered in turbulent waves.
12771	13	51	43	51	43	Her cities have become a desolation, a dry and arid land, a land where no one lives, where no son of man passes through.
12772	13	51	44	51	44	I will punish Bel in Babylon. I will make him spew out what he swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him; even the wall of Babylon will fall.
12773	13	51	45	51	45	Come out of her, My people! Save your lives, each of you, from the fierce anger of the LORD.
12774	13	51	46	51	46	Do not let your heart grow faint, and do not be afraid when the rumor is heard in the land; for a rumor will come one year—and then another the next year—of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler.
12775	13	51	47	51	47	Therefore, behold, the days are coming when I will punish the idols of Babylon. Her entire land will suffer shame, and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
12776	13	51	48	51	48	Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon because the destroyers from the north will come against her,” declares the LORD.
12777	13	51	49	51	49	“Babylon must fall on account of the slain of Israel, just as the slain of all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
12778	13	51	50	51	50	You who have escaped the sword, depart and do not linger! Remember the LORD from far away, and let Jerusalem come to mind.”
12779	13	51	51	51	51	“We are ashamed because we have heard reproach; disgrace has covered our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD’s house.”
12780	13	51	52	51	52	“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
12781	13	51	53	51	53	Even if Babylon ascends to the heavens and fortifies her lofty stronghold, the destroyers I send will come against her,” declares the LORD.
12782	13	51	54	51	54	“The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
12783	13	51	55	51	55	For the LORD will destroy Babylon; He will silence her mighty voice. The waves will roar like great waters; the tumult of their voice will resound.
12784	13	51	56	51	56	For a destroyer is coming against her—against Babylon. Her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken, for the LORD is a God of retribution; He will repay in full.
12785	13	51	57	51	57	I will make her princes and wise men drunk, along with her governors, officials, and warriors. Then they will fall asleep forever and not wake up,” declares the King, whose name is the LORD of Hosts.
12786	13	51	58	51	58	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Babylon’s thick walls will be leveled, and her high gates consumed by fire. So the labor of the people will be for nothing; the nations will exhaust themselves to fuel the flames.”
12787	13	51	59	51	59	This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to the quartermaster Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign.
12788	13	51	60	51	60	Jeremiah had written on a single scroll about all the disaster that would come upon Babylon—all these words that had been written concerning Babylon.
12789	13	51	61	51	61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud,
12790	13	51	62	51	62	and say, ‘O LORD, You have promised to cut off this place so that no one will remain—neither man nor beast. Indeed, it will be desolate forever.’
12791	13	51	63	51	63	When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and cast it into the Euphrates.
12792	13	51	64	51	64	Then you are to say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and never rise again, because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will grow weary.’” Here end the words of Jeremiah.
12793	13	52	1	52	1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
12794	13	52	2	52	2	And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
12795	13	52	3	52	3	For because of the anger of the LORD, all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He finally banished them from His presence. And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
12796	13	52	4	52	4	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped outside the city and built a siege wall all around it.
12797	13	52	5	52	5	And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
12798	13	52	6	52	6	By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food.
12799	13	52	7	52	7	Then the city was breached, and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. They headed toward the Arabah,
12800	13	52	8	52	8	but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him.
12801	13	52	9	52	9	The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on Zedekiah.
12802	13	52	10	52	10	There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and he also killed all the officials of Judah.
12803	13	52	11	52	11	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon, where he kept him in custody until his dying day.
12804	13	52	12	52	12	On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
12805	13	52	13	52	13	He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building.
12806	13	52	14	52	14	And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
12807	13	52	15	52	15	Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the craftsmen.
12808	13	52	16	52	16	But Nebuzaradan captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
12809	13	52	17	52	17	Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
12810	13	52	18	52	18	They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service.
12811	13	52	19	52	19	The captain of the guard also took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls—anything made of pure gold or fine silver.
12812	13	52	20	52	20	As for the two pillars, the Sea, the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands that King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.
12813	13	52	21	52	21	Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall and twelve cubits in circumference; each was hollow, four fingers thick.
12814	13	52	22	52	22	The bronze capital atop one pillar was five cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar.
12815	13	52	23	52	23	Each capital had ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, and a total of a hundred pomegranates were above the surrounding network.
12816	13	52	24	52	24	The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
12817	13	52	25	52	25	Of those still in the city, he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as seven trusted royal advisers. He also took the scribe of the captain of the army, who enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were found in the city.
12818	13	52	26	52	26	Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
12819	13	52	27	52	27	There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land.
12820	13	52	28	52	28	These are the people Nebuchadnezzar carried away: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
12821	13	52	29	52	29	in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
12822	13	52	30	52	30	in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried away 745 Jews. So in all, 4,600 people were taken away.
12823	13	52	31	52	31	Now on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the first year of the reign of Evil-merodach king of Babylon, he pardoned Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison.
12824	13	52	32	52	32	He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings with him in Babylon.
12825	13	52	33	52	33	So Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes, and he dined regularly at the king’s table for the rest of his life.
12826	13	52	34	52	34	And the king of Babylon allotted to him a daily portion for the rest of his life, until the day of his death.
12827	14	1	1	1	1	In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.
12828	14	1	2	1	2	On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
12829	14	1	3	1	3	the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Kebar. And there the LORD’s hand was upon him.
12830	14	1	4	1	4	I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire was a gleam like amber,
12831	14	1	5	1	5	and within it was the form of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: They had a human form,
12832	14	1	6	1	6	but each had four faces and four wings.
12833	14	1	7	1	7	Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze.
12834	14	1	8	1	8	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,
12835	14	1	9	1	9	and their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
12836	14	1	10	1	10	The form of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle.
12837	14	1	11	1	11	Such were their faces. Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.
12838	14	1	12	1	12	Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.
12839	14	1	13	1	13	In the midst of the living creatures was the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.
12840	14	1	14	1	14	The creatures were darting back and forth as quickly as flashes of lightning.
12841	14	1	15	1	15	When I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
12842	14	1	16	1	16	The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. Their workmanship looked like a wheel within a wheel.
12843	14	1	17	1	17	As they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved.
12844	14	1	18	1	18	Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
12845	14	1	19	1	19	So as the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
12846	14	1	20	1	20	Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
12847	14	1	21	1	21	When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
12848	14	1	22	1	22	Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an awesome expanse, gleaming like crystal.
12849	14	1	23	1	23	And under the expanse, their wings stretched out toward one another. Each one also had two wings covering its body.
12850	14	1	24	1	24	When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
12851	14	1	25	1	25	And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.
12852	14	1	26	1	26	Above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire, and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man.
12853	14	1	27	1	27	From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire within it all around. And from what seemed to be His waist down, I saw what looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him.
12854	14	1	28	1	28	The appearance of the brilliant light all around Him was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking.
12855	14	2	1	2	1	“Son of man,” He said to me, “stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.”
12856	14	2	2	2	2	And as He spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking to me.
12857	14	2	3	2	3	“Son of man,” He said to me: “I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me. To this very day they and their fathers have rebelled against Me.
12858	14	2	4	2	4	They are obstinate and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you are to say to them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’
12859	14	2	5	2	5	And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.
12860	14	2	6	2	6	But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns surround you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their presence, though they are a rebellious house.
12861	14	2	7	2	7	But speak My words to them, whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are rebellious.
12862	14	2	8	2	8	But you, son of man, listen to what I tell you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.”
12863	14	2	9	2	9	Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and in it was a scroll,
12864	14	2	10	2	10	which He unrolled before me. And written on the front and back of it were words of lamentation, mourning, and woe.
12865	14	3	1	3	1	“Son of man,” He said to me, “eat what you find here. Eat this scroll, then go and speak to the house of Israel.”
12866	14	3	2	3	2	So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.
12867	14	3	3	3	3	“Son of man,” He said to me, “eat and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you.” So I ate, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
12868	14	3	4	3	4	Then He said to me, “Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.
12869	14	3	5	3	5	For you are not being sent to a people of unfamiliar speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel—
12870	14	3	6	3	6	not to the many peoples of unfamiliar speech and difficult language whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
12871	14	3	7	3	7	But the house of Israel will be unwilling to listen to you, since they are unwilling to listen to Me. For the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.
12872	14	3	8	3	8	Behold, I will make your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
12873	14	3	9	3	9	I will make your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or dismayed at their presence, even though they are a rebellious house.”
12874	14	3	10	3	10	“Son of man,” He added, “listen carefully to all the words I speak to you, and take them to heart.
12875	14	3	11	3	11	Go to your people, the exiles; speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.”
12876	14	3	12	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me: ‘Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His dwelling place!’
12877	14	3	13	3	13	It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.
12878	14	3	14	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me.
12879	14	3	15	3	15	I came to the exiles at Tel-abib who dwelt by the River Kebar. And for seven days I sat where they sat and remained there among them, overwhelmed.
12880	14	3	16	3	16	At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12881	14	3	17	3	17	“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.
12882	14	3	18	3	18	If I say to the wicked man, ‘You will surely die,’ but you do not warn him or speak out to warn him from his wicked way to save his life, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, and I will hold you responsible for his blood.
12883	14	3	19	3	19	But if you warn a wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness and his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved yourself.
12884	14	3	20	3	20	Now if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die in his sin, and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. And I will hold you responsible for his blood.
12885	14	3	21	3	21	But if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself.”
12886	14	3	22	3	22	And there the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak with you.”
12887	14	3	23	3	23	So I got up and went out to the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD was present there, like the glory I had seen by the River Kebar, and I fell facedown.
12888	14	3	24	3	24	Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.
12889	14	3	25	3	25	And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes, and you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.
12890	14	3	26	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house.
12891	14	3	27	3	27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you are to tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.’ Whoever listens, let him listen; and whoever refuses, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.”
12892	14	4	1	4	1	“Now you, son of man, take a brick, place it before you, and draw on it the city of Jerusalem.
12893	14	4	2	4	2	Then lay siege against it: Construct a siege wall, build a ramp to it, set up camps against it, and place battering rams around it on all sides.
12894	14	4	3	4	3	Then take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Turn your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
12895	14	4	4	4	4	Then lie down on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side.
12896	14	4	5	4	5	For I have assigned to you 390 days, according to the number of years of their iniquity. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
12897	14	4	6	4	6	When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned to you 40 days, a day for each year.
12898	14	4	7	4	7	You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
12899	14	4	8	4	8	Now behold, I will tie you up with ropes so you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days of your siege.
12900	14	4	9	4	9	But take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself. This is what you are to eat during the 390 days you lie on your side.
12901	14	4	10	4	10	You are to weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day, and you are to eat it at set times.
12902	14	4	11	4	11	You are also to measure out a sixth of a hin of water to drink, and you are to drink it at set times.
12903	14	4	12	4	12	And you shall eat the food as you would a barley cake, after you bake it over dried human excrement in the sight of the people.”
12904	14	4	13	4	13	Then the LORD said, “This is how the Israelites will eat their defiled bread among the nations to which I will banish them.”
12905	14	4	14	4	14	“Ah, Lord GOD,” I said, “I have never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have not eaten anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts. No unclean meat has ever entered my mouth.”
12906	14	4	15	4	15	“Look,” He replied, “I will let you use cow dung instead of human excrement, and you may bake your bread over that.”
12907	14	4	16	4	16	Then He told me, “Son of man, I am going to cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat bread rationed by weight, and in despair they will drink water by measure.
12908	14	4	17	4	17	So they will lack food and water; they will be appalled at the sight of one another wasting away in their iniquity.”
12909	14	5	1	5	1	“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a set of scales and divide the hair.
12910	14	5	2	5	2	When the days of the siege have ended, you are to burn up a third of the hair inside the city; you are also to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind. For I will unleash a sword behind them.
12911	14	5	3	5	3	But you are to take a few strands of hair and secure them in the folds of your garment.
12912	14	5	4	5	4	Again, take a few of these, throw them into the fire, and burn them. From there a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel.
12913	14	5	5	5	5	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
12914	14	5	6	5	6	But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against My statutes worse than the countries around her. For her people have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.’
12915	14	5	7	5	7	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You have been more insubordinate than the nations around you; you have not walked in My statutes or kept My ordinances, nor have you even conformed to the ordinances of the nations around you.’
12916	14	5	8	5	8	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I Myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.
12917	14	5	9	5	9	Because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
12918	14	5	10	5	10	As a result, fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments against you and scatter all your remnant to every wind.’
12919	14	5	11	5	11	Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and abominations, I Myself will withdraw My favor; I will not look upon you with pity, nor will I spare you.
12920	14	5	12	5	12	A third of your people will die by plague or be consumed by famine within you, a third will fall by the sword outside your walls, and a third I will scatter to every wind and unleash a sword behind them.
12921	14	5	13	5	13	And when My anger is spent and I have vented My wrath against them, I will be appeased. And when I have spent My wrath on them, they will know that I, the LORD, in My zeal have spoken.
12922	14	5	14	5	14	I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
12923	14	5	15	5	15	So you will be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and raging fury. I, the LORD, have spoken.
12924	14	5	16	5	16	When I shower you with the deadly arrows of famine and destruction that I will send to destroy you, I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply of food.
12925	14	5	17	5	17	I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken.”
12926	14	6	1	6	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12927	14	6	2	6	2	“Son of man, set your face against the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.
12928	14	6	3	6	3	You are to say: ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: I am about to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
12929	14	6	4	6	4	Your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed; and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
12930	14	6	5	6	5	I will lay the corpses of the Israelites before their idols and scatter your bones around your altars.
12931	14	6	6	6	6	Wherever you live, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be demolished, so that your altars will be laid waste and desecrated, your idols smashed and obliterated, your incense altars cut down, and your works blotted out.
12932	14	6	7	6	7	The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the LORD.
12933	14	6	8	6	8	Yet I will leave a remnant, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the nations and throughout the lands.
12934	14	6	9	6	9	Then in the nations to which they have been carried captive, your survivors will remember Me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts that turned away from Me, and by their eyes that lusted after idols. So they will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their abominations.
12935	14	6	10	6	10	And they will know that I am the LORD; I did not declare in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.
12936	14	6	11	6	11	This is what the Lord GOD says: Clap your hands, stomp your feet, and cry out “Alas!” because of all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel, who will fall by sword and famine and plague.
12937	14	6	12	6	12	He who is far off will die by the plague, he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains will die by famine. So I will vent My fury upon them.
12938	14	6	13	6	13	Then you will know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree and leafy oak—the places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.
12939	14	6	14	6	14	I will stretch out My hand against them, and wherever they live I will make the land a desolate waste, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”
12940	14	7	1	7	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
12941	14	7	2	7	2	“O son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel: ‘The end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
12942	14	7	3	7	3	The end is now upon you, and I will unleash My anger against you. I will judge you according to your ways and repay you for all your abominations.
12943	14	7	4	7	4	I will not look on you with pity, nor will I spare you, but I will punish you for your ways and for the abominations among you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’
12944	14	7	5	7	5	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Disaster! An unprecedented disaster—behold, it is coming!
12945	14	7	6	7	6	The end has come! The end has come! It has roused itself against you. Behold, it has come!
12946	14	7	7	7	7	Doom has come to you, O inhabitants of the land. The time has come; the day is near; there is panic on the mountains instead of shouts of joy.
12947	14	7	8	7	8	Very soon I will pour out My wrath upon you and vent My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and punish you for all your abominations.
12948	14	7	9	7	9	I will not look on you with pity, nor will I spare you, but I will punish you for your ways and for the abominations among you. Then you will know that it is I, the LORD, who strikes the blow.
12949	14	7	10	7	10	Behold, the day is here! It has come! Doom has gone out, the rod has budded, arrogance has bloomed.
12950	14	7	11	7	11	Their violence has grown into a rod to punish their wickedness. None of them will remain: none of their multitude, none of their wealth, and nothing of value.
12951	14	7	12	7	12	The time has come; the day has arrived. Let the buyer not rejoice and the seller not mourn, for wrath is upon the whole multitude.
12952	14	7	13	7	13	The seller will surely not recover what he sold while both remain alive. For the vision concerning the whole multitude will not be revoked, and because of their iniquity, not one of them will preserve his life.
12953	14	7	14	7	14	They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one goes to war, for My wrath is upon the whole multitude.
12954	14	7	15	7	15	The sword is outside; plague and famine are within. Those in the country will die by the sword, and those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.
12955	14	7	16	7	16	The survivors will escape and live in the mountains, moaning like doves of the valley, each for his own iniquity.
12956	14	7	17	7	17	Every hand will go limp, and every knee will turn to water.
12957	14	7	18	7	18	They will put on sackcloth, and terror will overwhelm them. Shame will cover all their faces, and all their heads will be shaved.
12958	14	7	19	7	19	They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will seem unclean. Their silver and gold cannot save them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs with wealth, for it became the stumbling block that brought their iniquity.
12959	14	7	20	7	20	His beautiful ornaments they transformed into pride and used them to fashion their vile images and detestable idols. Therefore I will make these into something unclean for them.
12960	14	7	21	7	21	And I will hand these things over as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth, who will defile them.
12961	14	7	22	7	22	I will turn My face away from them, and they will defile My treasured place. Violent men will enter it, and they will defile it.
12962	14	7	23	7	23	Forge the chain, for the land is full of crimes of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence.
12963	14	7	24	7	24	So I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will end the pride of the mighty, and their holy places will be profaned.
12964	14	7	25	7	25	Anguish is coming! They will seek peace, but find none.
12965	14	7	26	7	26	Disaster upon disaster will come, and rumor after rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction from the priests will perish, as will counsel from the elders.
12966	14	7	27	7	27	The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and I will judge them by their own standards. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’”
12967	14	8	1	8	1	In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; and there the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me.
12968	14	8	2	8	2	Then I looked and saw a figure like that of a man. From His waist down His appearance was like fire, and from His waist up He was as bright as the gleam of amber.
12969	14	8	3	8	3	He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes jealousy was seated.
12970	14	8	4	8	4	And there I saw the glory of the God of Israel, like the vision I had seen in the plain.
12971	14	8	5	8	5	“Son of man,” He said to me, “now lift up your eyes to the north.” So I lifted up my eyes to the north, and in the entrance north of the Altar Gate I saw this idol of jealousy.
12972	14	8	6	8	6	“Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see what they are doing—the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing—to drive Me far from My sanctuary? Yet you will see even greater abominations.”
12973	14	8	7	8	7	Then He brought me to the entrance to the court, and I looked and saw a hole in the wall.
12974	14	8	8	8	8	“Son of man,” He told me, “dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall and discovered a doorway.
12975	14	8	9	8	9	Then He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations they are committing here.”
12976	14	8	10	8	10	So I went in and looked, and engraved all around the wall was every kind of crawling creature and detestable beast, along with all the idols of the house of Israel.
12977	14	8	11	8	11	Before them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
12978	14	8	12	8	12	“Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? For they are saying, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.’”
12979	14	8	13	8	13	Again, He told me, “You will see them committing even greater abominations.”
12980	14	8	14	8	14	Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.
12981	14	8	15	8	15	“Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see this? Yet you will see even greater abominations than these.”
12982	14	8	16	8	16	So He brought me to the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were bowing to the east in worship of the sun.
12983	14	8	17	8	17	“Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see this? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the abominations they are practicing here, that they must also fill the land with violence and continually provoke Me to anger? Look, they are even putting the branch to their nose!
12984	14	8	18	8	18	Therefore I will respond with wrath. I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. Although they shout loudly in My ears, I will not listen to them.”
12985	14	9	1	9	1	Then I heard Him call out in a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with a weapon of destruction in hand.”
12986	14	9	2	9	2	And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a weapon of slaughter in his hand. With them was another man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
12987	14	9	3	9	3	Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side.
12988	14	9	4	9	4	“Go throughout the city of Jerusalem,” said the LORD, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning over all the abominations committed there.”
12989	14	9	5	9	5	And as I listened, He said to the others, “Follow him through the city and start killing; do not show pity or spare anyone!
12990	14	9	6	9	6	Slaughter the old men, the young men and maidens, the women and children, but do not go near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at My sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the temple.
12991	14	9	7	9	7	Then He told them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
12992	14	9	8	9	8	While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord GOD, when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem, will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?”
12993	14	9	9	9	9	He replied, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.’
12994	14	9	10	9	10	But as for Me, I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. I will bring their deeds down upon their own heads.”
12995	14	9	11	9	11	Then the man clothed in linen with the writing kit at his side reported back, “I have done as You commanded.”
12996	14	10	1	10	1	And I looked and saw above the expanse, above the heads of the cherubim, the likeness of a throne of sapphire.
12997	14	10	2	10	2	And the LORD said to the man clothed in linen, “Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in.
12998	14	10	3	10	3	Now when the man went in, the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple, and a cloud filled the inner court.
12999	14	10	4	10	4	Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and stood over the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
13000	14	10	5	10	5	The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
13001	14	10	6	10	6	When the LORD commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
13002	14	10	7	10	7	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some of the fire that was among them. And he put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who received it and went out.
13003	14	10	8	10	8	(The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.)
13004	14	10	9	10	9	Then I looked and saw four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. And the wheels gleamed like a beryl stone.
13005	14	10	10	10	10	As for their appearance, all four had the same form, like a wheel within a wheel.
13006	14	10	11	10	11	When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions, without turning as they moved. For wherever the head faced, the cherubim would go in that direction, without turning as they moved.
13007	14	10	12	10	12	Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, and wings, were full of eyes all around, as were their four wheels.
13008	14	10	13	10	13	I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.”
13009	14	10	14	10	14	Each of the cherubim had four faces: the first face was that of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle.
13010	14	10	15	10	15	Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the River Kebar.
13011	14	10	16	10	16	When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and even when they spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not veer away from their side.
13012	14	10	17	10	17	When the cherubim stood still, the wheels also stood still, and when they ascended, the wheels ascended with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
13013	14	10	18	10	18	Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim.
13014	14	10	19	10	19	As I watched, the cherubim lifted their wings and rose up from the ground, with the wheels beside them as they went. And they stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, with the glory of the God of Israel above them.
13015	14	10	20	10	20	These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Kebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.
13016	14	10	21	10	21	Each had four faces and four wings, with what looked like human hands under their wings.
13017	14	10	22	10	22	Their faces looked like the faces I had seen by the River Kebar. Each creature went straight ahead.
13018	14	11	1	11	1	Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. And there at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, who were leaders of the people.
13019	14	11	2	11	2	And the LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked counsel in this city.
13020	14	11	3	11	3	They are saying, ‘Is not the time near to build houses? The city is the cooking pot, and we are the meat.’
13021	14	11	4	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man!”
13022	14	11	5	11	5	And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me and told me to declare that this is what the LORD says: “That is what you are thinking, O house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your minds.
13023	14	11	6	11	6	You have multiplied those you killed in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
13024	14	11	7	11	7	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: The slain you have laid within this city are the meat, and the city is the pot; but I will remove you from it.
13025	14	11	8	11	8	You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you, declares the Lord GOD.
13026	14	11	9	11	9	I will bring you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners, and I will execute judgments against you.
13027	14	11	10	11	10	You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you even to the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13028	14	11	11	11	11	The city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat within it. I will judge you even to the borders of Israel.
13029	14	11	12	11	12	Then you will know that I am the LORD. For you have neither followed My statutes nor practiced My ordinances, but you have conformed to the ordinances of the nations around you.”
13030	14	11	13	11	13	Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Oh, Lord GOD, will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?”
13031	14	11	14	11	14	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13032	14	11	15	11	15	“Son of man, your brothers—your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel—are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, ‘They are far away from the LORD; this land has been given to us as a possession.’
13033	14	11	16	11	16	Therefore declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries to which they have gone.’
13034	14	11	17	11	17	Therefore declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries to which you have been scattered, and I will give back to you the land of Israel.’
13035	14	11	18	11	18	When they return to it, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.
13036	14	11	19	11	19	And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh,
13037	14	11	20	11	20	so that they may follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God.
13038	14	11	21	11	21	But as for those whose hearts pursue detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
13039	14	11	22	11	22	Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
13040	14	11	23	11	23	And the glory of the LORD rose up from within the city and stood over the mountain east of the city.
13041	14	11	24	11	24	And the Spirit lifted me up and carried me back to Chaldea, to the exiles in the vision given by the Spirit of God. After the vision had gone up from me,
13042	14	11	25	11	25	I told the exiles everything the LORD had shown me.
13043	14	12	1	12	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13044	14	12	2	12	2	“Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.
13045	14	12	3	12	3	Therefore, son of man, pack your bags for exile. In broad daylight, set out from your place and go to another as they watch. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.
13046	14	12	4	12	4	Bring out your baggage for exile by day, as they watch. Then in the evening, as they watch, go out like those who go into exile.
13047	14	12	5	12	5	As they watch, dig through the wall and carry your belongings out through it.
13048	14	12	6	12	6	And as they watch, lift your bags to your shoulder and take them out at dusk; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”
13049	14	12	7	12	7	So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my bags for exile by day, and in the evening I dug through the wall by hand. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulder as they watched.
13050	14	12	8	12	8	And in the morning the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13051	14	12	9	12	9	“Son of man, hasn’t the rebellious house of Israel asked you, ‘What are you doing?’
13052	14	12	10	12	10	Tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are there.’
13053	14	12	11	12	11	You are to say, ‘I am a sign to you.’ Just as it happened here, so will it be done to them; they will go into exile as captives.
13054	14	12	12	12	12	And at dusk the prince among them will lift his bags to his shoulder and go out. They will dig through the wall to bring him out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land.
13055	14	12	13	12	13	But I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, and there he will die.
13056	14	12	14	12	14	I will also scatter to the winds all the attendants around him and all his troops, and I will draw a sword to chase after them.
13057	14	12	15	12	15	And they will know that I am the LORD when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them throughout the countries.
13058	14	12	16	12	16	But I will spare a few of them from sword and famine and plague, so that in the nations to which they go, they can recount all their abominations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
13059	14	12	17	12	17	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13060	14	12	18	12	18	“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.
13061	14	12	19	12	19	Then tell the people of the land that this is what the Lord GOD says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: ‘They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in dread, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who dwell in it.
13062	14	12	20	12	20	The inhabited cities will be laid waste, and the land will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
13063	14	12	21	12	21	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13064	14	12	22	12	22	“Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by, and every vision fails’?
13065	14	12	23	12	23	Therefore tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will put an end to this proverb, and in Israel they will no longer recite it.’ But say to them: ‘The days are at hand when every vision will be fulfilled.
13066	14	12	24	12	24	For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations within the house of Israel,
13067	14	12	25	12	25	because I, the LORD, will speak whatever word I speak, and it will be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak a message and bring it to pass, declares the Lord GOD.’”
13068	14	12	26	12	26	Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13069	14	12	27	12	27	“Son of man, take note that the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many years from now; he prophesies about the distant future.’
13070	14	12	28	12	28	Therefore tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘None of My words will be delayed any longer. The message I speak will be fulfilled, declares the Lord GOD.’”
13071	14	13	1	13	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13072	14	13	2	13	2	“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Tell those who prophesy out of their own imagination: Hear the word of the LORD!
13073	14	13	3	13	3	This is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, yet have seen nothing.
13074	14	13	4	13	4	Your prophets, O Israel, are like foxes among the ruins.
13075	14	13	5	13	5	You did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall around the house of Israel so that it would stand in the battle on the Day of the LORD.
13076	14	13	6	13	6	They see false visions and speak lying divinations. They claim, ‘Thus declares the LORD,’ when the LORD did not send them; yet they wait for the fulfillment of their message.
13077	14	13	7	13	7	Haven’t you seen a false vision and spoken a lying divination when you proclaim, ‘Thus declares the LORD,’ even though I have not spoken?
13078	14	13	8	13	8	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you have uttered vain words and seen false visions, I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.
13079	14	13	9	13	9	My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of My people or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.
13080	14	13	10	13	10	Because they have led My people astray, saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, and whitewashing any flimsy wall that is built,
13081	14	13	11	13	11	tell those whitewashing the wall that it will fall. Rain will come in torrents, I will send hailstones plunging down, and a windstorm will burst forth.
13082	14	13	12	13	12	Surely when the wall has fallen, you will not be asked, ‘Where is the whitewash with which you covered it?’
13083	14	13	13	13	13	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: In My wrath I will release a windstorm, and in My anger torrents of rain and hail will fall with destructive fury.
13084	14	13	14	13	14	I will tear down the wall you whitewashed and level it to the ground, so that its foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and you will be destroyed within it. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13085	14	13	15	13	15	And after I have vented My wrath against the wall and against those who whitewashed it, I will say to you: ‘The wall is gone, and so are those who whitewashed it—
13086	14	13	16	13	16	those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.’
13087	14	13	17	13	17	Now, O son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them
13088	14	13	18	13	18	and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their wrists and make veils for the heads of people of every height, in order to ensnare their souls. Will you ensnare the souls of My people but preserve your own?
13089	14	13	19	13	19	You have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to My people who would listen, you have killed those who should not have died and spared those who should not have lived.
13090	14	13	20	13	20	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: See, I am against the magic charms with which you ensnare souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms. I will free the souls you have ensnared.
13091	14	13	21	13	21	I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people from your hands, so that they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13092	14	13	22	13	22	Because you have disheartened the righteous with your lies, even though I have caused them no grief, and because you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways to save their lives,
13093	14	13	23	13	23	therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will deliver My people from your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD.”
13094	14	14	1	14	1	Then some of the elders of Israel came and sat down before me.
13095	14	14	2	14	2	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13096	14	14	3	14	3	“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I consult with them in any way?
13097	14	14	4	14	4	Therefore speak to them and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him according to his great idolatry,
13098	14	14	5	14	5	so that I may take hold of the hearts of the people of Israel. For because of their idols, they are all estranged from Me.’
13099	14	14	6	14	6	Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Repent and turn away from your idols; turn your faces away from all your abominations.
13100	14	14	7	14	7	For when any Israelite or any foreigner dwelling in Israel separates himself from Me, sets up idols in his heart, and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me, I the LORD will answer him Myself.
13101	14	14	8	14	8	I will set My face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among My people. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13102	14	14	9	14	9	But if the prophet is enticed to speak a message, then it was I the LORD who enticed him, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
13103	14	14	10	14	10	They will bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer will be the same as that of the prophet—
13104	14	14	11	14	11	in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Then they will be My people and I will be their God, declares the Lord GOD.’”
13105	14	14	12	14	12	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13106	14	14	13	14	13	“Son of man, if a land sins against Me by acting unfaithfully, and I stretch out My hand against it to cut off its supply of food, to send famine upon it, and to cut off from it both man and beast,
13107	14	14	14	14	14	then even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, their righteousness could deliver only themselves, declares the Lord GOD.
13108	14	14	15	14	15	Or if I send wild beasts through the land to leave it childless and desolate, with no man passing through it for fear of the beasts,
13109	14	14	16	14	16	then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even if these three men were in it, they could not deliver their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.
13110	14	14	17	14	17	Or if I bring a sword against that land and say, ‘Let a sword pass through it,’ so that I cut off from it both man and beast,
13111	14	14	18	14	18	then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters; they alone would be saved.
13112	14	14	19	14	19	Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out My wrath upon it through bloodshed, cutting off from it both man and beast,
13113	14	14	20	14	20	then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could deliver neither sons nor daughters. Their righteousness could save only themselves.
13114	14	14	21	14	21	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem My four dire judgments—sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—in order to cut off from it both man and beast?
13115	14	14	22	14	22	Yet, behold, some survivors will be left in it—sons and daughters who will be brought out. They will come out to you, and when you see their conduct and actions, you will be comforted regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem—all that I have brought upon it.
13116	14	14	23	14	23	They will bring you consolation when you see their conduct and actions, and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done all these things within it,’ declares the Lord GOD.”
13117	14	15	1	15	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13118	14	15	2	15	2	“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any other branch among the trees in the forest?
13119	14	15	3	15	3	Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can one make from it a peg on which to hang utensils?
13120	14	15	4	15	4	No, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire devours both ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything?
13121	14	15	5	15	5	Even when it was whole, it could not be made useful. How much less can it ever be useful when the fire has consumed it and charred it!
13122	14	15	6	15	6	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the people of Jerusalem.
13123	14	15	7	15	7	And I will set My face against them. Though they may have escaped the fire, yet another fire will consume them. And when I set My face against them, you will know that I am the LORD.
13124	14	15	8	15	8	Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’ declares the Lord GOD.”
13125	14	16	1	16	1	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13126	14	16	2	16	2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her abominations
13127	14	16	3	16	3	and tell her that this is what the Lord GOD says to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
13128	14	16	4	16	4	On the day of your birth your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water for cleansing. You were not rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths.
13129	14	16	5	16	5	No one cared enough for you to do even one of these things out of compassion for you. Instead, you were thrown out into the open field, because you were despised on the day of your birth.
13130	14	16	6	16	6	Then I passed by and saw you squirming in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, ‘Live!’ There I said to you, ‘Live!’
13131	14	16	7	16	7	I made you thrive like a plant of the field. You grew up and matured and became very beautiful. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.
13132	14	16	8	16	8	Then I passed by and saw you, and you were indeed old enough for love. So I spread My cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I pledged Myself to you, entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine, declares the Lord GOD.
13133	14	16	9	16	9	Then I bathed you with water, rinsed off your blood, and anointed you with oil.
13134	14	16	10	16	10	I clothed you in embroidered cloth and provided you sandals of fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
13135	14	16	11	16	11	I adorned you with jewelry, and I put bracelets on your wrists and a chain around your neck.
13136	14	16	12	16	12	I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.
13137	14	16	13	16	13	So you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was made of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be queen.
13138	14	16	14	16	14	Your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect in the splendor I bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD.
13139	14	16	15	16	15	But because of your fame, you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot. You lavished your favors on everyone who passed by, and your beauty was theirs for the asking.
13140	14	16	16	16	16	You took some of your garments and made colorful high places for yourself, and on them you prostituted yourself. Such things should not have happened; never should they have occurred!
13141	14	16	17	16	17	You also took the fine jewelry of gold and silver I had given you, and you made male idols with which to prostitute yourself.
13142	14	16	18	16	18	You took your embroidered garments to cover them, and you set My oil and incense before them.
13143	14	16	19	16	19	And you set before them as a pleasing aroma the food I had given you—the fine flour, oil, and honey that I had fed you. That is what happened, declares the Lord GOD.
13144	14	16	20	16	20	You even took the sons and daughters you bore to Me and sacrificed them as food to idols. Was your prostitution not enough?
13145	14	16	21	16	21	You slaughtered My children and delivered them up through the fire to idols.
13146	14	16	22	16	22	And in all your abominations and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your own blood.
13147	14	16	23	16	23	Woe! Woe to you, declares the Lord GOD. And in addition to all your other wickedness,
13148	14	16	24	16	24	you built yourself a mound and made yourself a lofty shrine in every public square.
13149	14	16	25	16	25	At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty. With increasing promiscuity, you spread your legs to all who passed by.
13150	14	16	26	16	26	You prostituted yourself with your lustful neighbors, the Egyptians, and increased your promiscuity to provoke Me to anger.
13151	14	16	27	16	27	Therefore I stretched out My hand against you and reduced your portion. I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd conduct.
13152	14	16	28	16	28	Then you prostituted yourself with the Assyrians, because you were not yet satisfied. Even after that, you were still not satisfied.
13153	14	16	29	16	29	So you extended your promiscuity to Chaldea, the land of merchants—but even with this you were not satisfied!
13154	14	16	30	16	30	How weak-willed is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, while you do all these things, the acts of a shameless prostitute!
13155	14	16	31	16	31	But when you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were not even like a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
13156	14	16	32	16	32	You adulterous wife! You receive strangers instead of your own husband!
13157	14	16	33	16	33	Men give gifts to all their prostitutes, but you gave gifts to all your lovers. You bribed them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors.
13158	14	16	34	16	34	So your prostitution is the opposite of that of other women: No one solicited your favors, and you paid a fee instead of receiving one; so you are the very opposite!
13159	14	16	35	16	35	Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD!
13160	14	16	36	16	36	This is what the Lord GOD says: Because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,
13161	14	16	37	16	37	therefore I will surely gather all the lovers with whom you found pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and expose you before them, and they will see you completely naked.
13162	14	16	38	16	38	And I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and those who shed blood; so I will bring upon you the wrath of your bloodshed and jealousy.
13163	14	16	39	16	39	Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will level your mounds and tear down your lofty shrines. They will strip off your clothes, take your fine jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.
13164	14	16	40	16	40	They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
13165	14	16	41	16	41	Then they will burn down your houses and execute judgment against you in the sight of many women. I will put an end to your prostitution, and you will never again pay your lovers.
13166	14	16	42	16	42	So I will lay to rest My wrath against you, and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be calm and no longer angry.
13167	14	16	43	16	43	Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but enraged Me with all these things, I will surely bring your deeds down upon your own head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not committed this lewdness on top of all your other abominations?
13168	14	16	44	16	44	Behold, all who speak in proverbs will quote this proverb about you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’
13169	14	16	45	16	45	You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
13170	14	16	46	16	46	Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters to your north; and your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters to your south.
13171	14	16	47	16	47	And you not only walked in their ways and practiced their abominations, but soon you were more depraved than they were.
13172	14	16	48	16	48	As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did as you and your daughters have done.
13173	14	16	49	16	49	Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and complacent; they did not help the poor and needy.
13174	14	16	50	16	50	Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them, as you have seen.
13175	14	16	51	16	51	Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs, and all the abominations you have committed have made your sisters appear righteous.
13176	14	16	52	16	52	So now you must bear your disgrace, since you have brought justification for your sisters. For they appear more righteous than you, because your sins were more vile than theirs. So you too must bear your shame and disgrace, since you have made your sisters appear righteous.
13177	14	16	53	16	53	But I will restore Sodom and her daughters from captivity, as well as Samaria and her daughters. And I will restore you along with them.
13178	14	16	54	16	54	So you will bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you did to comfort them.
13179	14	16	55	16	55	And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state. You and your daughters will also return to your former state.
13180	14	16	56	16	56	Did you not treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn in the day of your pride,
13181	14	16	57	16	57	before your wickedness was uncovered? Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all those around her, and by the daughters of the Philistines—all those around you who despise you.
13182	14	16	58	16	58	You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.
13183	14	16	59	16	59	For this is what the Lord GOD says: I will deal with you according to your deeds, since you have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
13184	14	16	60	16	60	But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
13185	14	16	61	16	61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older and younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of My covenant with you.
13186	14	16	62	16	62	So I will establish My covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD,
13187	14	16	63	16	63	so that when I make atonement for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your disgrace, declares the Lord GOD.”
13188	14	17	1	17	1	Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13189	14	17	2	17	2	“Son of man, pose a riddle; speak a parable to the house of Israel
13190	14	17	3	17	3	and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers of many colors, came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar.
13191	14	17	4	17	4	He plucked off its topmost shoot, carried it to the land of merchants, and planted it in a city of traders.
13192	14	17	5	17	5	He took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil; he placed it by abundant waters; he set it out like a willow.
13193	14	17	6	17	6	It sprouted and became a spreading vine, low in height, with branches turned toward him; yet its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and yielded branches and sent out shoots.
13194	14	17	7	17	7	But there was another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him. It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed, so that he might water it.
13195	14	17	8	17	8	It had been planted in good soil by abundant waters in order to yield branches and bear fruit and become a splendid vine.’
13196	14	17	9	17	9	So you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Will it flourish? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it shrivels? All its foliage will wither! It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by its roots.
13197	14	17	10	17	10	Even if it is transplanted, will it flourish? Will it not completely wither when the east wind strikes? It will wither on the bed where it sprouted.’”
13198	14	17	11	17	11	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13199	14	17	12	17	12	“Now say to this rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, carried off its king and officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon.
13200	14	17	13	17	13	He took a member of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. Then he carried away the leading men of the land,
13201	14	17	14	17	14	so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to lift itself up, surviving only by keeping his covenant.
13202	14	17	15	17	15	But this king rebelled against Babylon by sending his envoys to Egypt to ask for horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and yet escape?’
13203	14	17	16	17	16	‘As surely as I live,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who enthroned him, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.
13204	14	17	17	17	17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and vast horde will not help him in battle, when ramps are built and siege walls constructed to destroy many lives.
13205	14	17	18	17	18	He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Seeing that he gave his hand in pledge yet did all these, he will not escape!’
13206	14	17	19	17	19	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘As surely as I live, I will bring down upon his head My oath that he despised and My covenant that he broke.
13207	14	17	20	17	20	I will spread My net over him and catch him in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment upon him there for the treason he committed against Me.
13208	14	17	21	17	21	All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and those who survive will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken.’
13209	14	17	22	17	22	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will take a shoot from the lofty top of the cedar, and I will set it out. I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
13210	14	17	23	17	23	I will plant it on the mountain heights of Israel so that it will bear branches; it will yield fruit and become a majestic cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it, taking shelter in the shade of its branches.
13211	14	17	24	17	24	Then all the trees of the field will know that I am the LORD. I bring the tall tree down and make the low tree tall. I dry up the green tree and make the withered tree flourish. I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it.’”
13212	14	18	1	18	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13213	14	18	2	18	2	“What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge’?
13214	14	18	3	18	3	As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel.
13215	14	18	4	18	4	Behold, every soul belongs to Me; both father and son are Mine. The soul who sins is the one who will die.
13216	14	18	5	18	5	Now suppose a man is righteous and does what is just and right:
13217	14	18	6	18	6	‘He does not eat at the mountain or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife or approach a woman during her period.
13218	14	18	7	18	7	He does not oppress another, but restores the pledge to the debtor. He does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing.
13219	14	18	8	18	8	He does not engage in usury or take excess interest, but he withholds his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between men.
13220	14	18	9	18	9	He follows My statutes and faithfully keeps My ordinances. That man is righteous; surely he will live,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13221	14	18	10	18	10	Now suppose that man has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these things,
13222	14	18	11	18	11	though the father has done none of them: ‘Indeed, the son eats at the mountain and defiles his neighbor’s wife.
13223	14	18	12	18	12	He oppresses the poor and needy; he commits robbery and does not restore a pledge. He lifts his eyes to idols; he commits abominations.
13224	14	18	13	18	13	He engages in usury and takes excess interest.’ Will this son live? He will not! Since he has committed all these abominations, he will surely die; his blood will be on his own head.
13225	14	18	14	18	14	Now suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, considers them, and does not do likewise:
13226	14	18	15	18	15	‘He does not eat at the mountain or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife.
13227	14	18	16	18	16	He does not oppress another, or retain a pledge, or commit robbery. He gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing.
13228	14	18	17	18	17	He withholds his hand from harming the poor and takes no interest or usury. He keeps My ordinances and follows My statutes.’ Such a man will not die for his father’s iniquity. He will surely live.
13229	14	18	18	18	18	As for his father, he will die for his own iniquity, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what was wrong among his people.
13230	14	18	19	18	19	Yet you may ask, ‘Why shouldn’t the son bear the iniquity of his father?’ Since the son has done what is just and right, carefully observing all My statutes, he will surely live.
13231	14	18	20	18	20	The soul who sins is the one who will die. A son will not bear the iniquity of his father, and a father will not bear the iniquity of his son. The righteousness of the righteous man will fall upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked man will fall upon him.
13232	14	18	21	18	21	But if the wicked man turns from all the sins he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.
13233	14	18	22	18	22	None of the transgressions he has committed will be held against him. Because of the righteousness he has practiced, he will live.
13234	14	18	23	18	23	Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Lord GOD. Wouldn’t I prefer that he turn from his ways and live?
13235	14	18	24	18	24	But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, committing the same abominations as the wicked, will he live? None of the righteous acts he did will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness and sin he has committed, he will die.
13236	14	18	25	18	25	Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is it My way that is unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
13237	14	18	26	18	26	If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, he will die for this. He will die because of the iniquity he has committed.
13238	14	18	27	18	27	But if a wicked man turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life.
13239	14	18	28	18	28	Because he considered and turned from all the transgressions he had committed, he will surely live; he will not die.
13240	14	18	29	18	29	Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Are My ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
13241	14	18	30	18	30	Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so that your iniquity will not become your downfall.
13242	14	18	31	18	31	Cast away from yourselves all the transgressions you have committed, and fashion for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, O house of Israel?
13243	14	18	32	18	32	For I take no pleasure in anyone’s death, declares the Lord GOD. So repent and live!”
13244	14	19	1	19	1	“As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel
13245	14	19	2	19	2	and say: ‘What was your mother? A lioness among the lions! She lay down among the young lions; she reared her cubs.
13246	14	19	3	19	3	She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. After learning to tear his prey, he devoured men.
13247	14	19	4	19	4	When the nations heard of him, he was trapped in their pit. With hooks they led him away to the land of Egypt.
13248	14	19	5	19	5	When she saw that she had waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
13249	14	19	6	19	6	He prowled among the lions, and became a young lion. After learning to tear his prey, he devoured men.
13250	14	19	7	19	7	He broke down their strongholds and devastated their cities. The land and everything in it shuddered at the sound of his roaring.
13251	14	19	8	19	8	Then the nations set out against him from the provinces on every side. They spread their net over him; he was trapped in their pit.
13252	14	19	9	19	9	With hooks they caged him and brought him to the king of Babylon. They brought him into captivity so that his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of Israel.
13253	14	19	10	19	10	Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the water; it was fruitful and full of branches because of the abundant waters.
13254	14	19	11	19	11	It had strong branches, fit for a ruler’s scepter. It towered high above the thick branches, conspicuous for its height and for its dense foliage.
13255	14	19	12	19	12	But it was uprooted in fury, cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branches were stripped off and they withered; the fire consumed them.
13256	14	19	13	19	13	Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
13257	14	19	14	19	14	Fire has gone out from its main branch and devoured its fruit; on it no strong branch remains fit for a ruler’s scepter.’ This is a lament and shall be used as a lament.”
13258	14	20	1	20	1	In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down before me.
13259	14	20	2	20	2	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13260	14	20	3	20	3	“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: Have you come to inquire of Me? As surely as I live, I will not be consulted by you, declares the Lord GOD.
13261	14	20	4	20	4	Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Confront them with the abominations of their fathers
13262	14	20	5	20	5	and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt. With an uplifted hand I said to them, ‘I am the LORD your God.’
13263	14	20	6	20	6	On that day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands.
13264	14	20	7	20	7	And I said to them: ‘Each of you must throw away the abominations before his eyes, and you must not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’
13265	14	20	8	20	8	But they rebelled against Me and refused to listen. None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes, and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the land of Egypt.
13266	14	20	9	20	9	But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living, in whose sight I had revealed Myself to Israel by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
13267	14	20	10	20	10	So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
13268	14	20	11	20	11	And I gave them My statutes and made known to them My ordinances—for the man who does these things will live by them.
13269	14	20	12	20	12	I also gave them My Sabbaths as a sign between us, so that they would know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
13270	14	20	13	20	13	Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not follow My statutes and they rejected My ordinances—though the man who does these things will live by them—and they utterly profaned My Sabbaths. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and put an end to them in the wilderness.
13271	14	20	14	20	14	But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
13272	14	20	15	20	15	Moreover, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands—
13273	14	20	16	20	16	because they kept rejecting My ordinances, refusing to walk in My statutes, and profaning My Sabbaths; for their hearts continually went after their idols.
13274	14	20	17	20	17	Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or bring them to an end in the wilderness.
13275	14	20	18	20	18	In the wilderness I said to their children: ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.
13276	14	20	19	20	19	I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them.
13277	14	20	20	20	20	Keep My Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us, so that you may know that I am the LORD your God.’
13278	14	20	21	20	21	But the children rebelled against Me. They did not walk in My statutes or carefully observe My ordinances—though the man who does these things will live by them—and they profaned My Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the wilderness.
13279	14	20	22	20	22	But I withheld My hand and acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
13280	14	20	23	20	23	However, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.
13281	14	20	24	20	24	For they did not practice My ordinances, but they rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, fixing their eyes on the idols of their fathers.
13282	14	20	25	20	25	I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live.
13283	14	20	26	20	26	And I pronounced them unclean through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn in the fire—so that I might devastate them, in order that they would know that I am the LORD.
13284	14	20	27	20	27	Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: In this way also your fathers blasphemed Me by their unfaithfulness against Me.
13285	14	20	28	20	28	When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and they saw any high hill or leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, presented offerings that provoked Me, sent up their fragrant incense, and poured out their drink offerings.
13286	14	20	29	20	29	So I asked them: ‘What is this high place to which you go?’ (And to this day it is called Bamah.)
13287	14	20	30	20	30	Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: Will you defile yourselves the way your fathers did, prostituting yourselves with their abominations?
13288	14	20	31	20	31	When you offer your gifts, sacrificing your sons in the fire, you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. So should I be consulted by you, O house of Israel? As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you!
13289	14	20	32	20	32	When you say, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of the lands, serving wood and stone,’ what you have in mind will never come to pass.
13290	14	20	33	20	33	As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I will rule over you.
13291	14	20	34	20	34	With a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered.
13292	14	20	35	20	35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, where I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
13293	14	20	36	20	36	Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD.
13294	14	20	37	20	37	I will make you pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
13295	14	20	38	20	38	And I will purge you of those who rebel and transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land in which they dwell, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13296	14	20	39	20	39	And as for you, O house of Israel, this is what the Lord GOD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you. But afterward, you will surely listen to Me, and you will no longer defile My holy name with your gifts and idols.
13297	14	20	40	20	40	For on My holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land. There I will accept them and will require your offerings and choice gifts, along with all your holy sacrifices.
13298	14	20	41	20	41	When I bring you from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, I will accept you as a pleasing aroma. And I will show My holiness through you in the sight of the nations.
13299	14	20	42	20	42	Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I swore to give your fathers.
13300	14	20	43	20	43	There you will remember your ways and all the deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evils you have done.
13301	14	20	44	20	44	Then you will know, O house of Israel, that I am the LORD, when I have dealt with you for the sake of My name and not according to your wicked ways and corrupt acts, declares the Lord GOD.”
13302	14	21	1	20	45	Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13303	14	21	2	20	46	“Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against it, and prophesy against the forest of the Negev.
13304	14	21	3	20	47	Say to the forest of the Negev: Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord GOD says: I am about to ignite in you a fire, and it will devour all your trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will not be quenched, and by it every face from south to north will be scorched.
13305	14	21	4	20	48	Then all people will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it will not be quenched.”
13306	14	21	5	20	49	Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, they are saying of me, ‘Is he not just telling parables?’”
13307	14	21	6	21	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13308	14	21	7	21	2	“Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
13309	14	21	8	21	3	and tell her that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am against you, and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
13310	14	21	9	21	4	Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, My sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
13311	14	21	10	21	5	Then all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have taken My sword from its sheath, not to return it again.’
13312	14	21	11	21	6	But you, son of man, groan! Groan before their eyes with a broken heart and bitter grief.
13313	14	21	12	21	7	And when they ask, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you are to say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, and every hand will go limp. Every spirit will faint, and every knee will turn to water.’ Yes, it is coming and it will surely happen, declares the Lord GOD.”
13314	14	21	13	21	8	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13315	14	21	14	21	9	“Son of man, prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord says: ‘A sword, a sword, sharpened and polished—
13316	14	21	15	21	10	it is sharpened for the slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Should we rejoice in the scepter of My son? The sword despises every such stick.
13317	14	21	16	21	11	The sword is appointed to be polished, to be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished, to be placed in the hand of the slayer.
13318	14	21	17	21	12	Cry out and wail, O son of man, for the sword is wielded against My people; it is against all the princes of Israel! They are tossed to the sword with My people; therefore strike your thigh.
13319	14	21	18	21	13	Surely testing will come! And what if even the scepter, which the sword despises, does not continue? declares the Lord GOD.’
13320	14	21	19	21	14	So then, son of man, prophesy and strike your hands together. Let the sword strike two times, even three. It is a sword that slays, a sword of great slaughter closing in on every side!
13321	14	21	20	21	15	So that their hearts may melt and many may stumble, I have appointed at all their gates a sword for slaughter. Yes, it is ready to flash like lightning; it is drawn for slaughter.
13322	14	21	21	21	16	Slash to the right; set your blade to the left—wherever your blade is directed.
13323	14	21	22	21	17	I too will strike My hands together, and I will satisfy My wrath. I, the LORD, have spoken.”
13324	14	21	23	21	18	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13325	14	21	24	21	19	“Now you, son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same land. And make a signpost where the road branches off to each city.
13326	14	21	25	21	20	Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and another against Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
13327	14	21	26	21	21	For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He shakes the arrows, he consults the idols, he examines the liver.
13328	14	21	27	21	22	In his right hand appears the portent for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to call for the slaughter, to lift a battle cry, to direct the battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect a siege wall.
13329	14	21	28	21	23	It will seem like a false omen to the eyes of those who have sworn allegiance to him, but it will draw attention to their guilt and take them captive.
13330	14	21	29	21	24	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have drawn attention to your guilt, exposing your transgressions, so that your sins are revealed in all your deeds—because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand.
13331	14	21	30	21	25	And you, O profane and wicked prince of Israel, the day has come for your final punishment.’
13332	14	21	31	21	26	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Remove the turban, and take off the crown. Things will not remain as they are: Exalt the lowly and bring low the exalted.
13333	14	21	32	21	27	A ruin, a ruin, I will make it a ruin! And it will not be restored until He comes to whom it belongs, to whom I have assigned judgment.’
13334	14	21	33	21	28	Now prophesy, son of man, and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt: ‘A sword! A sword is drawn for slaughter, polished to consume, to flash like lightning—
13335	14	21	34	21	29	while they offer false visions for you and lying divinations about you—to be placed on the necks of the wicked who are slain, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.
13336	14	21	35	21	30	Return the sword to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you.
13337	14	21	36	21	31	I will pour out My anger upon you; I will breathe the fire of My fury against you; I will hand you over to brutal men, skilled in destruction.
13338	14	21	37	21	32	You will be fuel for the fire. Your blood will stain your own land. You will not be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.’”
13339	14	22	1	22	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13340	14	22	2	22	2	“As for you, son of man, will you judge her? Will you pass judgment on the city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her abominations
13341	14	22	3	22	3	and tell her that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘O city who brings her own doom by shedding blood within her walls and making idols to defile herself,
13342	14	22	4	22	4	you are guilty of the blood you have shed, and you are defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close and have come to the end of your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the lands.
13343	14	22	5	22	5	Those near and far will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.
13344	14	22	6	22	6	See how every prince of Israel within you has used his power to shed blood.
13345	14	22	7	22	7	Father and mother are treated with contempt. Within your walls the foreign resident is exploited, the fatherless and the widow are oppressed.
13346	14	22	8	22	8	You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.
13347	14	22	9	22	9	Among you are slanderous men bent on bloodshed; within you are those who eat on the mountain shrines and commit acts of indecency.
13348	14	22	10	22	10	In you they have uncovered the nakedness of their fathers; in you they violate women during their menstrual impurity.
13349	14	22	11	22	11	One man commits an abomination with his neighbor’s wife; another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law; and yet another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.
13350	14	22	12	22	12	In you they take bribes to shed blood. You engage in usury, take excess interest, and extort your neighbors. But Me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
13351	14	22	13	22	13	Now look, I strike My hands together against your unjust gain and against the blood you have shed in your midst.
13352	14	22	14	22	14	Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will act.
13353	14	22	15	22	15	I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you throughout the lands; I will purge your uncleanness.
13354	14	22	16	22	16	And when you have defiled yourself in the eyes of the nations, then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
13355	14	22	17	22	17	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13356	14	22	18	22	18	“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me. All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace; they are but the dross of silver.
13357	14	22	19	22	19	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because all of you have become dross, behold, I will gather you into Jerusalem.
13358	14	22	20	22	20	Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace to melt with a fiery blast, so I will gather you in My anger and wrath, leave you there, and melt you.
13359	14	22	21	22	21	Yes, I will gather you together and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted within the city.
13360	14	22	22	22	22	As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted within the city. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My wrath upon you.’”
13361	14	22	23	22	23	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13362	14	22	24	22	24	“Son of man, say to her, ‘In the day of indignation, you are a land that has not been cleansed, upon which no rain has fallen.’
13363	14	22	25	22	25	The conspiracy of the princes in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing its prey. They devour the people, seize the treasures and precious things, and multiply the widows within her.
13364	14	22	26	22	26	Her priests do violence to My law and profane My holy things. They make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they fail to distinguish between the clean and the unclean. They disregard My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
13365	14	22	27	22	27	Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives for dishonest gain.
13366	14	22	28	22	28	Her prophets whitewash these deeds by false visions and lying divinations, saying, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ when the LORD has not spoken.
13367	14	22	29	22	29	The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy and have exploited the foreign resident without justice.
13368	14	22	30	22	30	I searched for a man among them to repair the wall and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, so that I should not destroy it. But I found no one.
13369	14	22	31	22	31	So I have poured out My indignation upon them and consumed them with the fire of My fury. I have brought their ways down upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
13370	14	23	1	23	1	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13371	14	23	2	23	2	“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother,
13372	14	23	3	23	3	and they played in Egypt, prostituting themselves from their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin bosoms caressed.
13373	14	23	4	23	4	The older was named Oholah, and her sister was named Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their identities, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
13374	14	23	5	23	5	Oholah prostituted herself while she was still Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors
13375	14	23	6	23	6	clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all desirable young men, horsemen mounted on steeds.
13376	14	23	7	23	7	She offered sexual favors to all the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all the idols of those for whom she lusted.
13377	14	23	8	23	8	She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her virgin bosom, and poured out their lust upon her.
13378	14	23	9	23	9	Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians for whom she lusted.
13379	14	23	10	23	10	They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and put her to the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgment against her.
13380	14	23	11	23	11	Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.
13381	14	23	12	23	12	She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors dressed in splendor, horsemen riding on steeds, all desirable young men.
13382	14	23	13	23	13	And I saw that she too had defiled herself; both of them had taken the same path.
13383	14	23	14	23	14	But Oholibah carried her prostitution even further. She saw the men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion,
13384	14	23	15	23	15	wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
13385	14	23	16	23	16	At the sight of them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
13386	14	23	17	23	17	Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. But after she had been defiled by them, she turned away in disgust.
13387	14	23	18	23	18	When Oholibah openly prostituted herself and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.
13388	14	23	19	23	19	Yet she multiplied her promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth, when she had prostituted herself in the land of Egypt
13389	14	23	20	23	20	and lusted after their lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions.
13390	14	23	21	23	21	So you revisited the indecency of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your bosom and pressed your young breasts.
13391	14	23	22	23	22	Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will incite your lovers against you, those from whom you turned away in disgust. And I will bring them against you from every side—
13392	14	23	23	23	23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them—all desirable young men, governors and commanders, officers and men of renown, mounted on horses.
13393	14	23	24	23	24	They will come against you with a host of peoples, with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will array themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet. I will delegate judgment to them, and they will punish you according to their own standards.
13394	14	23	25	23	25	And I will set My jealous rage against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and your remnant will be consumed by fire.
13395	14	23	26	23	26	They will strip off your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
13396	14	23	27	23	27	So I will put an end to your indecency and prostitution, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.’
13397	14	23	28	23	28	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Surely I will deliver you into the hands of those you hate, from whom you turned away in disgust.
13398	14	23	29	23	29	They will treat you with hatred, take all for which you have worked, and leave you naked and bare, so that the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your indecency and promiscuity
13399	14	23	30	23	30	have brought these things upon you, because you have prostituted yourself with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
13400	14	23	31	23	31	Because you have followed the path of your sister, I will put her cup into your hand.’
13401	14	23	32	23	32	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup deep and wide. It will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much.
13402	14	23	33	23	33	You will be filled with drunkenness and grief, with a cup of devastation and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
13403	14	23	34	23	34	You will drink it and drain it; you will dash it to pieces, and tear your breasts. For I have spoken,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13404	14	23	35	23	35	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have forgotten Me and have cast Me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your indecency and prostitution.’”
13405	14	23	36	23	36	Then the LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
13406	14	23	37	23	37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to Me, in the fire as food for their idols.
13407	14	23	38	23	38	They have also done this to Me: On that very same day, they defiled My sanctuary and profaned My Sabbaths.
13408	14	23	39	23	39	On the very day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary to profane it. Yes, they did this inside My house.
13409	14	23	40	23	40	Furthermore, you sisters sent messengers for men who came from afar; and behold, when they arrived, you bathed for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry.
13410	14	23	41	23	41	You sat on a couch of luxury with a table spread before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil,
13411	14	23	42	23	42	accompanied by the sound of a carefree crowd. Drunkards were brought in from the desert along with men from the rabble, who put bracelets on your wrists and beautiful crowns on your head.
13412	14	23	43	23	43	Then I said of her who had grown old in adulteries: ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is!’
13413	14	23	44	23	44	And they slept with her as with a prostitute; they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, those lewd women.
13414	14	23	45	23	45	But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of those who commit adultery and bloodshed, because they are adulteresses with blood on their hands.
13415	14	23	46	23	46	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Bring a mob against them and consign them to terror and plunder.
13416	14	23	47	23	47	The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses.
13417	14	23	48	23	48	So I will put an end to indecency in the land, and all the women will be admonished not to imitate your behavior.
13418	14	23	49	23	49	They will repay you for your indecency, and you will bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’”
13419	14	24	1	24	1	In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13420	14	24	2	24	2	“Son of man, write down today’s date, for on this very day the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem.
13421	14	24	3	24	3	Now speak a parable to this rebellious house and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Put the pot on the fire; put it on and pour in the water.
13422	14	24	4	24	4	Put in the pieces of meat, every good piece—thigh and shoulder—fill it with choice bones.
13423	14	24	5	24	5	Take the choicest of the flock and pile the fuel beneath it. Bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it.’
13424	14	24	6	24	6	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed, to the pot now rusted, whose rust will not come off! Empty it piece by piece; cast no lots for its contents.
13425	14	24	7	24	7	For the blood she shed is still within her; she poured it out on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dust.
13426	14	24	8	24	8	In order to stir up wrath and take vengeance, I have placed her blood on the bare rock, so that it would not be covered.’
13427	14	24	9	24	9	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the city of bloodshed! I, too, will pile the kindling high.
13428	14	24	10	24	10	Pile on the logs and kindle the fire; cook the meat well and mix in the spices; let the bones be burned.
13429	14	24	11	24	11	Set the empty pot on its coals until it becomes hot and its copper glows. Then its impurity will melt within; its rust will be consumed.
13430	14	24	12	24	12	It has frustrated every effort; its thick rust has not been removed, even by the fire.
13431	14	24	13	24	13	Because of the indecency of your uncleanness I tried to cleanse you, but you would not be purified from your filthiness. You will not be pure again until My wrath against you has subsided.
13432	14	24	14	24	14	I, the LORD, have spoken; the time is coming, and I will act. I will not refrain or show pity, nor will I relent. I will judge you according to your ways and deeds,’ declares the Lord GOD.”
13433	14	24	15	24	15	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13434	14	24	16	24	16	“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the desire of your eyes with a fatal blow. But you must not lament or weep or let your tears flow.
13435	14	24	17	24	17	Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips or eat the bread of mourners.”
13436	14	24	18	24	18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And the next morning I did as I had been commanded.
13437	14	24	19	24	19	Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean to us?”
13438	14	24	20	24	20	So I answered them, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
13439	14	24	21	24	21	Tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the delight of your soul. And the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.’
13440	14	24	22	24	22	Then you will do as I have done: You will not cover your lips or eat the bread of mourners.
13441	14	24	23	24	23	Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep, but you will waste away because of your sins, and you will groan among yourselves.
13442	14	24	24	24	24	‘Thus Ezekiel will be a sign for you; you will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
13443	14	24	25	24	25	And you, son of man, know that on the day I take away their stronghold, their pride and joy—the desire of their eyes which uplifted their souls—and their sons and daughters as well,
13444	14	24	26	24	26	on that day a fugitive will come and tell you the news.
13445	14	24	27	24	27	On that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the LORD.”
13446	14	25	1	25	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13447	14	25	2	25	2	“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
13448	14	25	3	25	3	Tell the Ammonites to hear the word of the Lord GOD, for this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you exclaimed, “Aha!” when My sanctuary was profaned, when the land of Israel was laid waste, and when the house of Judah went into exile,
13449	14	25	4	25	4	therefore I will indeed give you as a possession to the people of the East. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
13450	14	25	5	25	5	I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and Ammon a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’
13451	14	25	6	25	6	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you clapped your hands and stomped your feet and rejoiced over the land of Israel with a heart full of contempt,
13452	14	25	7	25	7	therefore I will indeed stretch out My hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the LORD.’
13453	14	25	8	25	8	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Look, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,”
13454	14	25	9	25	9	therefore I will indeed expose the flank of Moab beginning with its frontier cities—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim—the glory of the land.
13455	14	25	10	25	10	I will give it along with the Ammonites as a possession to the people of the East, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.
13456	14	25	11	25	11	So I will execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD.’
13457	14	25	12	25	12	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah, and in so doing incurred grievous guilt,
13458	14	25	13	25	13	therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I will stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off from it both man and beast. I will make it a wasteland, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
13459	14	25	14	25	14	I will take My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath. Then they will know My vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.’
13460	14	25	15	25	15	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took vengeance with malice of soul to destroy Judah with ancient hostility,
13461	14	25	16	25	16	therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the remnant along the coast.
13462	14	25	17	25	17	I will execute great vengeance against them with furious reproof. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay My vengeance upon them.’”
13463	14	26	1	26	1	In the eleventh month of the twelfth year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13464	14	26	2	26	2	“Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to the nations is broken; it has swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will be filled,’
13465	14	26	3	26	3	therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, O Tyre, I am against you, and I will raise up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.
13466	14	26	4	26	4	They will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers. I will scrape the soil from her and make her a bare rock.
13467	14	26	5	26	5	She will become a place to spread nets in the sea, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. She will become plunder for the nations,
13468	14	26	6	26	6	and the villages on her mainland will be slain by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’
13469	14	26	7	26	7	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with cavalry and a great company of troops.
13470	14	26	8	26	8	He will slaughter the villages of your mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp to your walls, and raise his shields against you.
13471	14	26	9	26	9	He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and tear down your towers with his axes.
13472	14	26	10	26	10	His multitude of horses will cover you in their dust. When he enters your gates as an army entering a breached city, your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots.
13473	14	26	11	26	11	The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets. He will slaughter your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
13474	14	26	12	26	12	They will plunder your wealth and pillage your merchandise. They will demolish your walls, tear down your beautiful homes, and throw your stones and timber and soil into the water.
13475	14	26	13	26	13	So I will silence the sound of your songs, and the music of your lyres will no longer be heard.
13476	14	26	14	26	14	I will make you a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread the fishing nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, the LORD, have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.’
13477	14	26	15	26	15	This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyre: ‘Will not the coastlands quake at the sound of your downfall, when the wounded groan at the slaughter in your midst?
13478	14	26	16	26	16	All the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled over you.
13479	14	26	17	26	17	Then they will lament for you, saying, “How you have perished, O city of renown inhabited by seafaring men—she who was powerful on the sea, along with her people, who imposed terror on all peoples!
13480	14	26	18	26	18	Now the coastlands tremble on the day of your downfall; the islands in the sea are dismayed by your demise.”’
13481	14	26	19	26	19	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When I make you a desolate city like other deserted cities, and when I raise up the deep against you so that the mighty waters cover you,
13482	14	26	20	26	20	then I will bring you down with those who descend to the Pit, to the people of antiquity. I will make you dwell in the earth below like the ancient ruins, with those who descend to the Pit, so that you will no longer be inhabited or set in splendor in the land of the living.
13483	14	26	21	26	21	I will make you an object of horror, and you will be no more. You will be sought, but will never be found,’ declares the Lord GOD.”
13484	14	27	1	27	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13485	14	27	2	27	2	“Now you, son of man, take up a lament for Tyre.
13486	14	27	3	27	3	Tell Tyre, who dwells at the gateway to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coasts, that this is what the Lord GOD says: You have said, O Tyre, ‘I am perfect in beauty.’
13487	14	27	4	27	4	Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders perfected your beauty.
13488	14	27	5	27	5	They constructed all your planking with cypress from Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
13489	14	27	6	27	6	Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, inlaid with ivory.
13490	14	27	7	27	7	Of embroidered fine linen from Egypt they made your sail, which served as your banner. Of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah they made your awning.
13491	14	27	8	27	8	The men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen. Your men of skill, O Tyre, were there as your captains.
13492	14	27	9	27	9	The elders of Gebal were aboard as shipwrights, repairing your leaks. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to barter for your merchandise.
13493	14	27	10	27	10	Men of Persia, Lydia, and Put served as warriors in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls; they gave you splendor.
13494	14	27	11	27	11	Men of Arvad and Helech manned your walls all around, and the men of Gammad were in your towers. They hung their shields around your walls; they perfected your beauty.
13495	14	27	12	27	12	Tarshish was your merchant because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your wares.
13496	14	27	13	27	13	Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your merchandise.
13497	14	27	14	27	14	The men of Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your wares.
13498	14	27	15	27	15	The men of Dedan were your clients; many coastlands were your market; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.
13499	14	27	16	27	16	Aram was your customer because of your many products; they exchanged turquoise, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your wares.
13500	14	27	17	27	17	Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged wheat from Minnith, cakes and honey, oil and balm for your merchandise.
13501	14	27	18	27	18	Because of your many products and your great wealth of goods, Damascus traded with you wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar,
13502	14	27	19	27	19	and casks of wine from Izal for your wares. Wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were exchanged for your merchandise.
13503	14	27	20	27	20	Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
13504	14	27	21	27	21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers, trading in lambs, rams, and goats.
13505	14	27	22	27	22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; for your wares they exchanged gold, the finest of all spices, and precious stones.
13506	14	27	23	27	23	Haran, Canneh, and Eden traded with you, and so did the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad.
13507	14	27	24	27	24	In your marketplace they traded with you fine garments of blue, embroidered work, and multicolored rugs with cords tightly twisted and knotted.
13508	14	27	25	27	25	The ships of Tarshish carried your merchandise. And you were filled with heavy cargo in the heart of the sea.
13509	14	27	26	27	26	Your oarsmen have brought you onto the high seas, but the east wind will shatter you in the heart of the sea.
13510	14	27	27	27	27	Your wealth, wares, and merchandise, your sailors, captains, and shipwrights, your merchants and all the warriors within you, with all the other people on board, will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall.
13511	14	27	28	27	28	The countryside will shake when your sailors cry out.
13512	14	27	29	27	29	All who handle the oars will abandon their ships. The sailors and all the captains of the sea will stand on the shore.
13513	14	27	30	27	30	They will raise their voices for you and cry out bitterly. They will throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.
13514	14	27	31	27	31	They will shave their heads for you and wrap themselves in sackcloth. They will weep over you with anguish of soul and bitter mourning.
13515	14	27	32	27	32	As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament for you: ‘Who was ever like Tyre, silenced in the middle of the sea?
13516	14	27	33	27	33	When your wares went out to sea, you satisfied many nations. You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and merchandise.
13517	14	27	34	27	34	Now you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and the people among you have gone down with you.
13518	14	27	35	27	35	All the people of the coastlands are appalled over you. Their kings shudder with fear; their faces are contorted.
13519	14	27	36	27	36	Those who trade among the nations hiss at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”
13520	14	28	1	28	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13521	14	28	2	28	2	“Son of man, tell the ruler of Tyre that this is what the Lord GOD says: Your heart is proud, and you have said, ‘I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea.’ Yet you are a man and not a god, though you have regarded your heart as that of a god.
13522	14	28	3	28	3	Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you!
13523	14	28	4	28	4	By your wisdom and understanding you have gained your wealth and amassed gold and silver for your treasuries.
13524	14	28	5	28	5	By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has grown proud because of it.
13525	14	28	6	28	6	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you regard your heart as the heart of a god,
13526	14	28	7	28	7	behold, I will bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations. They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and will defile your splendor.
13527	14	28	8	28	8	They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.
13528	14	28	9	28	9	Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ in the presence of those who slay you? You will be only a man, not a god, in the hands of those who wound you.
13529	14	28	10	28	10	You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. For I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.”
13530	14	28	11	28	11	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13531	14	28	12	28	12	“Son of man, take up a lament for the king of Tyre and tell him that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13532	14	28	13	28	13	You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold, prepared on the day of your creation.
13533	14	28	14	28	14	You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for I had ordained you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.
13534	14	28	15	28	15	From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways—until wickedness was found in you.
13535	14	28	16	28	16	By the vastness of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and I banished you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.
13536	14	28	17	28	17	Your heart grew proud of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor; so I cast you to the earth; I made you a spectacle before kings.
13537	14	28	18	28	18	By the multitude of your iniquities and the dishonesty of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries. So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the eyes of all who saw you.
13538	14	28	19	28	19	All the nations who know you are appalled over you. You have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”
13539	14	28	20	28	20	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13540	14	28	21	28	21	“Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her.
13541	14	28	22	28	22	And you are to declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will be glorified within you. They will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate My holiness through her.
13542	14	28	23	28	23	I will send a plague against her and shed blood in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
13543	14	28	24	28	24	For the people of Israel will no longer face a pricking brier or a painful thorn from all around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
13544	14	28	25	28	25	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, I will show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations. Then they will dwell in their own land, which I have given to My servant Jacob.
13545	14	28	26	28	26	And there they will dwell securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will dwell securely when I execute judgments against all those around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.’”
13546	14	29	1	29	1	In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13547	14	29	2	29	2	“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
13548	14	29	3	29	3	Speak to him and tell him that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, O great monster who lies among his rivers, who says, ‘The Nile is mine; I made it myself.’
13549	14	29	4	29	4	But I will put hooks in your jaws and cause the fish of your streams to cling to your scales. I will haul you up out of your rivers, and all the fish of your streams will cling to your scales.
13550	14	29	5	29	5	I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and will not be taken away or gathered for burial. I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air.
13551	14	29	6	29	6	Then all the people of Egypt will know that I am the LORD. For you were only a staff of reeds to the house of Israel.
13552	14	29	7	29	7	When Israel took hold of you with their hands, you splintered, tearing all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke, and their backs were wrenched.
13553	14	29	8	29	8	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I will bring a sword against you and cut off from you man and beast.
13554	14	29	9	29	9	The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD. Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine; I made it,’
13555	14	29	10	29	10	therefore I am against you and against your rivers. I will turn the land of Egypt into a ruin, a desolate wasteland from Migdol to Syene, and as far as the border of Cush.
13556	14	29	11	29	11	No foot of man or beast will pass through, and it will be uninhabited for forty years.
13557	14	29	12	29	12	I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolate lands, and her cities will lie desolate for forty years among the ruined cities. And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the countries.
13558	14	29	13	29	13	For this is what the Lord GOD says: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations to which they were scattered.
13559	14	29	14	29	14	I will restore Egypt from captivity and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin. There they will be a lowly kingdom.
13560	14	29	15	29	15	Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the nations. For I will diminish Egypt so that it will never again rule over the nations.
13561	14	29	16	29	16	Egypt will never again be an object of trust for the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity in turning to the Egyptians. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.”
13562	14	29	17	29	17	In the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the first month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13563	14	29	18	29	18	“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to labor strenuously against Tyre. Every head was made bald and every shoulder made raw. But he and his army received no wages from Tyre for the labor they expended on it.
13564	14	29	19	29	19	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will carry off its wealth, seize its spoil, and remove its plunder. This will be the wages for his army.
13565	14	29	20	29	20	I have given him the land of Egypt as the reward for his labor, because it was done for Me, declares the Lord GOD.
13566	14	29	21	29	21	In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth to speak among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
13567	14	30	1	30	1	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13568	14	30	2	30	2	“Son of man, prophesy and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Wail, ‘Alas for that day!’
13569	14	30	3	30	3	For the day is near, the Day of the LORD is near. It will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
13570	14	30	4	30	4	A sword will come against Egypt, and there will be anguish in Cush when the slain fall in Egypt, its wealth is taken away, and its foundations are torn down.
13571	14	30	5	30	5	Cush, Put, and Lud, and all the various peoples, as well as Libya and the men of the covenant land, will fall with Egypt by the sword.
13572	14	30	6	30	6	For this is what the LORD says: The allies of Egypt will fall, and her proud strength will collapse. From Migdol to Syene they will fall by the sword within her, declares the Lord GOD.
13573	14	30	7	30	7	They will be desolate among desolate lands, and their cities will lie among ruined cities.
13574	14	30	8	30	8	Then they will know that I am the LORD when I set fire to Egypt and all her helpers are shattered.
13575	14	30	9	30	9	On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships to frighten Cush out of complacency. Anguish will come upon them on the day of Egypt’s doom. For it is indeed coming.
13576	14	30	10	30	10	This is what the Lord GOD says: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
13577	14	30	11	30	11	He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
13578	14	30	12	30	12	I will make the streams dry up and sell the land to the wicked. By the hands of foreigners I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it. I, the LORD, have spoken.
13579	14	30	13	30	13	This is what the Lord GOD says: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images in Memphis. There will no longer be a prince in Egypt, and I will instill fear in that land.
13580	14	30	14	30	14	I will lay waste Pathros, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgment on Thebes.
13581	14	30	15	30	15	I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the crowds of Thebes.
13582	14	30	16	30	16	I will set fire to Egypt, Pelusium will writhe in anguish, Thebes will be split open, and Memphis will face daily distress.
13583	14	30	17	30	17	The young men of On and Pi-beseth will fall by the sword, and those cities will go into captivity.
13584	14	30	18	30	18	The day will be darkened in Tahpanhes when I break the yoke of Egypt and her proud strength comes to an end. A cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity.
13585	14	30	19	30	19	So I will execute judgment on Egypt, and they will know that I am the LORD.”
13586	14	30	20	30	20	In the eleventh year, on the seventh day of the first month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13587	14	30	21	30	21	“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. See, it has not been bound up for healing, or splinted for strength to hold the sword.
13588	14	30	22	30	22	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one already broken, and will make the sword fall from his hand.
13589	14	30	23	30	23	I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
13590	14	30	24	30	24	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king and place My sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, who will groan before him like a mortally wounded man.
13591	14	30	25	30	25	I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall limp. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I place My sword in the hand of Babylon’s king, and he wields it against the land of Egypt.
13592	14	30	26	30	26	When I disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands, they will know that I am the LORD.”
13593	14	31	1	31	1	In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13594	14	31	2	31	2	“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: ‘Who can be compared to your greatness?
13595	14	31	3	31	3	Look at Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches that shaded the forest. It towered on high; its top was among the clouds.
13596	14	31	4	31	4	The waters made it grow; the deep springs made it tall, directing their streams all around its base and sending their channels to all the trees of the field.
13597	14	31	5	31	5	Therefore it towered higher than all the trees of the field. Its branches multiplied, and its boughs grew long as it spread them out because of the abundant waters.
13598	14	31	6	31	6	All the birds of the air nested in its branches, and all the beasts of the field gave birth beneath its boughs; all the great nations lived in its shade.
13599	14	31	7	31	7	It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its limbs, for its roots extended to abundant waters.
13600	14	31	8	31	8	The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it; the cypresses could not compare with its branches, nor the plane trees match its boughs. No tree in the garden of God could compare with its beauty.
13601	14	31	9	31	9	I made it beautiful with its many branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden, which were in the garden of God.’
13602	14	31	10	31	10	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Since it became great in height and set its top among the clouds, and it grew proud on account of its height,
13603	14	31	11	31	11	I delivered it into the hand of the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with it according to its wickedness. I have banished it.
13604	14	31	12	31	12	Foreigners, the most ruthless of the nations, cut it down and left it. Its branches have fallen on the mountains and in every valley; its boughs lay broken in all the earth’s ravines. And all the peoples of the earth left its shade and abandoned it.
13605	14	31	13	31	13	All the birds of the air nested on its fallen trunk, and all the beasts of the field lived among its boughs.
13606	14	31	14	31	14	This happened so that no other trees by the waters would become great in height and set their tops among the clouds, and no other well-watered trees would reach them in height. For they have all been consigned to death, to the depths of the earth, among the mortals who descend to the Pit.’
13607	14	31	15	31	15	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘On the day it was brought down to Sheol, I caused mourning. I covered the deep because of it; I held back its rivers; its abundant waters were restrained. I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
13608	14	31	16	31	16	I made the nations quake at the sound of its downfall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend to the Pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, all the well-watered trees, were consoled in the earth below.
13609	14	31	17	31	17	They too descended with it to Sheol, to those slain by the sword. As its allies they had lived in its shade among the nations.
13610	14	31	18	31	18	Who then is like you in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? You also will be brought down to the depths of the earth to be with the trees of Eden. You will lie among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD.’”
13611	14	32	1	32	1	In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13612	14	32	2	32	2	“Son of man, take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: ‘You are like a lion among the nations; you are like a monster in the seas. You thrash about in your rivers, churning up the waters with your feet and muddying the streams.’
13613	14	32	3	32	3	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will spread My net over you with a company of many peoples, and they will draw you up in My net.
13614	14	32	4	32	4	I will abandon you on the land and hurl you into the open field. I will cause all the birds of the air to settle upon you, and all the beasts of the earth to eat their fill of you.
13615	14	32	5	32	5	I will put your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains.
13616	14	32	6	32	6	I will drench the land with the flow of your blood, all the way to the mountains—the ravines will be filled.
13617	14	32	7	32	7	When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.
13618	14	32	8	32	8	All the shining lights in the heavens I will darken over you, and I will bring darkness upon your land,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13619	14	32	9	32	9	‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring about your destruction among the nations, in countries you do not know.
13620	14	32	10	32	10	I will cause many peoples to be appalled over you, and their kings will shudder in horror because of you when I brandish My sword before them. On the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life.’
13621	14	32	11	32	11	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you!
13622	14	32	12	32	12	I will make your hordes fall by the swords of the mighty, the most ruthless of all nations. They will ravage the pride of Egypt and all her multitudes will be destroyed.
13623	14	32	13	32	13	I will slaughter all her cattle beside the abundant waters. No human foot will muddy them again, and no cattle hooves will disturb them.
13624	14	32	14	32	14	Then I will let her waters settle and will make her rivers flow like oil,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13625	14	32	15	32	15	‘When I make the land of Egypt a desolation and empty it of all that filled it, when I strike down all who live there, then they will know that I am the LORD.’
13626	14	32	16	32	16	This is the lament they will chant for her; the daughters of the nations will chant it. Over Egypt and all her multitudes they will chant it, declares the Lord GOD.”
13627	14	32	17	32	17	In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13628	14	32	18	32	18	“Son of man, wail for the multitudes of Egypt, and consign both her and the daughters of the mighty nations to the depths of the earth with those who descend to the Pit:
13629	14	32	19	32	19	Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be placed with the uncircumcised!
13630	14	32	20	32	20	They will fall among those slain by the sword. The sword is appointed! Let them drag her away along with all her multitudes.
13631	14	32	21	32	21	Mighty chiefs will speak from the midst of Sheol about Egypt and her allies: ‘They have come down and lie with the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.’
13632	14	32	22	32	22	Assyria is there with her whole company; her graves are all around her. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword.
13633	14	32	23	32	23	Her graves are set in the depths of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword—those who once spread terror in the land of the living.
13634	14	32	24	32	24	Elam is there with all her multitudes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword—those who went down uncircumcised to the earth below, who once spread their terror in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.
13635	14	32	25	32	25	Among the slain they prepare a resting place for Elam with all her hordes, with her graves all around her. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, although their terror was once spread in the land of the living. They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit. They are placed among the slain.
13636	14	32	26	32	26	Meshech and Tubal are there with all their multitudes, with their graves all around them. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, because they spread their terror in the land of the living.
13637	14	32	27	32	27	They do not lie down with the fallen warriors of old, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were placed under their heads, whose shields rested on their bones, although the terror of the mighty was once in the land of the living.
13638	14	32	28	32	28	But you too will be shattered and lie down among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.
13639	14	32	29	32	29	Edom is there, and all her kings and princes, who despite their might are laid among those slain by the sword. They lie down with the uncircumcised, with those who descend to the Pit.
13640	14	32	30	32	30	All the leaders of the north and all the Sidonians are there; they went down in disgrace with the slain, despite the terror of their might. They lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their shame with those who descend to the Pit.
13641	14	32	31	32	31	Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude—Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord GOD.
13642	14	32	32	32	32	For I will spread My terror in the land of the living, so that Pharaoh and all his multitude will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword, declares the Lord GOD.”
13643	14	33	1	33	1	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13644	14	33	2	33	2	“Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: ‘Suppose I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land choose a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman,
13645	14	33	3	33	3	and he sees the sword coming against that land and blows the ram’s horn to warn the people.
13646	14	33	4	33	4	Then if anyone hears the sound of the horn but fails to heed the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.
13647	14	33	5	33	5	Since he heard the sound of the horn but failed to heed the warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life.
13648	14	33	6	33	6	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and fails to blow the horn to warn the people, and the sword comes and takes away a life, then that one will be taken away in his iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.’
13649	14	33	7	33	7	As for you, O son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word from My mouth and give them warning from Me.
13650	14	33	8	33	8	If I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ but you do not speak out to dissuade him from his way, then that wicked man will die in his iniquity, yet I will hold you accountable for his blood.
13651	14	33	9	33	9	But if you warn the wicked man to turn from his way, and he does not turn from it, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.
13652	14	33	10	33	10	Now as for you, son of man, tell the house of Israel that this is what they have said: ‘Our transgressions and our sins are heavy upon us, and we are wasting away because of them! How can we live?’
13653	14	33	11	33	11	Say to them: ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked should turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?’
13654	14	33	12	33	12	Therefore, son of man, say to your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked man cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. Nor will the righteous man be able to survive by his righteousness on the day he sins.’
13655	14	33	13	33	13	If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live, but he then trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, then none of his righteous works will be remembered; he will die because of the iniquity he has committed.
13656	14	33	14	33	14	But if I tell the wicked man, ‘You will surely die,’ and he turns from his sin and does what is just and right—
13657	14	33	15	33	15	if he restores a pledge, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing iniquity—then he will surely live; he will not die.
13658	14	33	16	33	16	None of the sins he has committed will be held against him. He has done what is just and right; he will surely live.
13659	14	33	17	33	17	Yet your people say, ‘The way of the LORD is not just.’ But it is their way that is not just.
13660	14	33	18	33	18	If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die for it.
13661	14	33	19	33	19	But if a wicked man turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live because of this.
13662	14	33	20	33	20	Yet you say, ‘The way of the LORD is not just.’ But I will judge each of you according to his ways, O house of Israel.”
13663	14	33	21	33	21	In the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth day of the tenth month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and reported, “The city has been taken!”
13664	14	33	22	33	22	Now the evening before the fugitive arrived, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer mute.
13665	14	33	23	33	23	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13666	14	33	24	33	24	“Son of man, those living in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.’
13667	14	33	25	33	25	Therefore tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You eat meat with the blood in it, lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
13668	14	33	26	33	26	You have relied on your swords, you have committed detestable acts, and each of you has defiled his neighbor’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’
13669	14	33	27	33	27	Tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘As surely as I live, those in the ruins will fall by the sword, those in the open field I will give to be devoured by wild animals, and those in the strongholds and caves will die by plague.
13670	14	33	28	33	28	I will make the land a desolate waste, and the pride of her strength will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will become desolate, so that no one will pass through.
13671	14	33	29	33	29	Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the abominations they have committed.’
13672	14	33	30	33	30	As for you, son of man, your people are talking about you near the city walls and in the doorways of their houses. One speaks to another, each saying to his brother, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the LORD!’
13673	14	33	31	33	31	So My people come to you as usual, sit before you, and hear your words; but they do not put them into practice. Although they express love with their mouths, their hearts pursue dishonest gain.
13674	14	33	32	33	32	Indeed, you are to them like a singer of love songs with a beautiful voice, who skillfully plays an instrument. They hear your words but do not put them into practice.
13675	14	33	33	33	33	So when it comes to pass—and surely it will come—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
13676	14	34	1	34	1	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13677	14	34	2	34	2	“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who only feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed their flock?
13678	14	34	3	34	3	You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fattened sheep, but you do not feed the flock.
13679	14	34	4	34	4	You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bound up the injured, brought back the strays, or searched for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty.
13680	14	34	5	34	5	They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild beasts.
13681	14	34	6	34	6	My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the face of all the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.’
13682	14	34	7	34	7	Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
13683	14	34	8	34	8	‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because My flock lacks a shepherd and has become prey and food for every wild beast, and because My shepherds did not search for My flock but fed themselves instead,
13684	14	34	9	34	9	therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD!’
13685	14	34	10	34	10	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand from them My flock and remove them from tending the flock, so that they can no longer feed themselves. For I will deliver My flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them.’
13686	14	34	11	34	11	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I Myself will search for My flock and seek them out.
13687	14	34	12	34	12	As a shepherd looks for his scattered sheep when he is among the flock, so I will look for My flock. I will rescue them from all the places to which they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
13688	14	34	13	34	13	I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements of the land.
13689	14	34	14	34	14	I will feed them in good pasture, and the lofty mountains of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in a good grazing land; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
13690	14	34	15	34	15	I will tend My flock and make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
13691	14	34	16	34	16	I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bind up the broken, and strengthen the weak; but the sleek and strong I will destroy. I will shepherd them with justice.’
13692	14	34	17	34	17	This is what the Lord GOD says to you, My flock: ‘I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the goats.
13693	14	34	18	34	18	Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink the clear waters? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet?
13694	14	34	19	34	19	Why must My flock feed on what your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied?’
13695	14	34	20	34	20	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says to them: ‘Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
13696	14	34	21	34	21	Since you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak ones with your horns until you have scattered them abroad,
13697	14	34	22	34	22	I will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey. I will judge between one sheep and another.
13698	14	34	23	34	23	I will appoint over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them. He will feed them and be their shepherd.
13699	14	34	24	34	24	I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David will be a prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken.
13700	14	34	25	34	25	I will make with them a covenant of peace and rid the land of wild animals, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest.
13701	14	34	26	34	26	I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season—showers of blessing.
13702	14	34	27	34	27	The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure in their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from the hands that enslaved them.
13703	14	34	28	34	28	They will no longer be prey for the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not consume them. They will dwell securely, and no one will frighten them.
13704	14	34	29	34	29	And I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.
13705	14	34	30	34	30	Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13706	14	34	31	34	31	‘You are My flock, the sheep of My pasture, My people, and I am your God,’ declares the Lord GOD.”
13707	14	35	1	35	1	Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13708	14	35	2	35	2	“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,
13709	14	35	3	35	3	and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Mount Seir. I will stretch out My hand against you and make you a desolate waste.
13710	14	35	4	35	4	I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13711	14	35	5	35	5	Because you harbored an ancient hatred and delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their disaster at the final stage of their punishment,
13712	14	35	6	35	6	therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.
13713	14	35	7	35	7	I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.
13714	14	35	8	35	8	I will fill its mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
13715	14	35	9	35	9	I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13716	14	35	10	35	10	Because you have said, ‘These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,’ even though the LORD was there,
13717	14	35	11	35	11	therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred against them, and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
13718	14	35	12	35	12	Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard every contemptuous word you uttered against the mountains of Israel when you said, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!’
13719	14	35	13	35	13	You boasted against Me with your mouth and multiplied your words against Me. I heard it Myself!
13720	14	35	14	35	14	This is what the Lord GOD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
13721	14	35	15	35	15	As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so will I do to you. You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir, and so will all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
13722	14	36	1	36	1	“And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
13723	14	36	2	36	2	This is what the Lord GOD says: Because the enemy has said of you, ‘Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,’
13724	14	36	3	36	3	therefore prophesy and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you on every side, so that you became a possession of the rest of the nations and were taken up in slander by the lips of their talkers,
13725	14	36	4	36	4	therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have become a spoil and a mockery to the rest of the nations around you.
13726	14	36	5	36	5	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Surely in My burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who took My land as their own possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, so that its pastureland became plunder.
13727	14	36	6	36	6	Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and tell the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I have spoken in My burning zeal because you have endured the reproach of the nations.
13728	14	36	7	36	7	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I have sworn with an uplifted hand that surely the nations around you will endure reproach of their own.
13729	14	36	8	36	8	But you, O mountains of Israel, will produce branches and bear fruit for My people Israel, for they will soon come home.
13730	14	36	9	36	9	For behold, I am on your side; I will turn toward you, and you will be tilled and sown.
13731	14	36	10	36	10	I will multiply the people upon you—the house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
13732	14	36	11	36	11	I will fill you with people and animals, and they will multiply and be fruitful. I will make you as inhabited as you once were, and I will make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
13733	14	36	12	36	12	Yes, I will cause My people Israel to walk upon you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will no longer deprive them of their children.
13734	14	36	13	36	13	For this is what the Lord GOD says: Because people say to you, ‘You devour men and deprive your nation of its children,’
13735	14	36	14	36	14	therefore you will no longer devour men or deprive your nation of its children, declares the Lord GOD.
13736	14	36	15	36	15	I will no longer allow the taunts of the nations to be heard against you, and you will no longer endure the reproach of the peoples or cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD.”
13737	14	36	16	36	16	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13738	14	36	17	36	17	“Son of man, when the people of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. Their behavior before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman’s impurity.
13739	14	36	18	36	18	So I poured out My wrath upon them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.
13740	14	36	19	36	19	I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered throughout the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
13741	14	36	20	36	20	And wherever they went among the nations, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD, yet they had to leave His land.’
13742	14	36	21	36	21	But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they had gone.
13743	14	36	22	36	22	Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: It is not for your sake that I will act, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you profaned among the nations to which you went.
13744	14	36	23	36	23	I will show the holiness of My great name, which has been profaned among the nations—the name you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when I show My holiness in you before their eyes.
13745	14	36	24	36	24	For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and I will bring you back into your own land.
13746	14	36	25	36	25	I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.
13747	14	36	26	36	26	I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
13748	14	36	27	36	27	And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes and to carefully observe My ordinances.
13749	14	36	28	36	28	Then you will live in the land that I gave your forefathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God.
13750	14	36	29	36	29	I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will summon the grain and make it plentiful, and I will not bring famine upon you.
13751	14	36	30	36	30	I will also make the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field plentiful, so that you will no longer bear reproach among the nations on account of famine.
13752	14	36	31	36	31	Then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and abominations.
13753	14	36	32	36	32	It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD—let it be known to you. Be ashamed and disgraced for your own ways, O house of Israel!
13754	14	36	33	36	33	This is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be resettled and the ruins to be rebuilt.
13755	14	36	34	36	34	The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through.
13756	14	36	35	36	35	Then they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.’
13757	14	36	36	36	36	Then the nations around you that remain will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt what was destroyed, and I have replanted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it.
13758	14	36	37	36	37	This is what the Lord GOD says: Once again I will hear the plea of the house of Israel and do for them this: I will multiply their people like a flock.
13759	14	36	38	36	38	Like the numerous flocks for sacrifices at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so the ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
13760	14	37	1	37	1	The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by His Spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley, and it was full of bones.
13761	14	37	2	37	2	He led me all around among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, and indeed, they were very dry.
13762	14	37	3	37	3	Then He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones come to life?” “O Lord GOD,” I replied, “only You know.”
13763	14	37	4	37	4	And He said to me, “Prophesy concerning these bones and tell them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!
13764	14	37	5	37	5	This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will come to life.
13765	14	37	6	37	6	I will attach tendons to you and make flesh grow upon you and cover you with skin. I will put breath within you so that you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’”
13766	14	37	7	37	7	So I prophesied as I had been commanded. And as I prophesied, there was suddenly a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone.
13767	14	37	8	37	8	As I looked on, tendons appeared on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.
13768	14	37	9	37	9	Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and tell the breath that this is what the Lord GOD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, so that they may live!”
13769	14	37	10	37	10	So I prophesied as He had commanded me, and the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet—a vast army.
13770	14	37	11	37	11	Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off.’
13771	14	37	12	37	12	Therefore prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘O My people, I will open your graves and bring you up from them, and I will bring you back to the land of Israel.
13772	14	37	13	37	13	Then you, My people, will know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves and bring you up from them.
13773	14	37	14	37	14	I will put My Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.’”
13774	14	37	15	37	15	Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13775	14	37	16	37	16	“And you, son of man, take a single stick and write on it: ‘Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick and write on it: ‘Belonging to Joseph—the stick of Ephraim—and to all the house of Israel associated with him.’
13776	14	37	17	37	17	Then join them together into one stick, so that they become one in your hand.
13777	14	37	18	37	18	When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you explain to us what you mean by these?’
13778	14	37	19	37	19	you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Judah. I will make them into a single stick, and they will become one in My hand.’
13779	14	37	20	37	20	When the sticks on which you write are in your hand and in full view of the people,
13780	14	37	21	37	21	you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will take the Israelites out of the nations to which they have gone, and I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land.
13781	14	37	22	37	22	I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will rule over all of them. Then they will no longer be two nations and will never again be divided into two kingdoms.
13782	14	37	23	37	23	They will no longer defile themselves with their idols or detestable images, or with any of their transgressions. I will save them from all their apostasies by which they sinned, and I will cleanse them. Then they will be My people, and I will be their God.
13783	14	37	24	37	24	My servant David will be king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow My ordinances and keep and observe My statutes.
13784	14	37	25	37	25	They will live in the land that I gave to My servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They will live there forever with their children and grandchildren, and My servant David will be their prince forever.
13785	14	37	26	37	26	And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary among them forever.
13786	14	37	27	37	27	My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be My people.
13787	14	37	28	37	28	Then the nations will know that I the LORD sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary is among them forever.’”
13788	14	38	1	38	1	And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
13789	14	38	2	38	2	“Son of man, set your face against Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him
13790	14	38	3	38	3	and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
13791	14	38	4	38	4	I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your army—your horses, your horsemen in full armor, and a great company armed with shields and bucklers, all brandishing their swords.
13792	14	38	5	38	5	Persia, Cush, and Put will accompany them, all with shields and helmets,
13793	14	38	6	38	6	as well as Gomer with all its troops, and Beth-togarmah from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you.
13794	14	38	7	38	7	Get ready; prepare yourself, you and all your company gathered around you; you will be their guard.
13795	14	38	8	38	8	After a long time you will be summoned. In the latter years you will enter a land brought back from war and regathered from many peoples to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and all now dwell securely.
13796	14	38	9	38	9	You and all your troops, and many peoples with you will go up, advancing like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.
13797	14	38	10	38	10	This is what the Lord GOD says: On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
13798	14	38	11	38	11	You will say, ‘I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will come against a tranquil people who dwell securely, all of them living without walls or bars or gates—
13799	14	38	12	38	12	in order to seize the spoil and carry off the plunder, to turn a hand against the desolate places now inhabited and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and possessions and who live at the center of the land.’
13800	14	38	13	38	13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will ask, ‘Have you come to capture spoil? Have you assembled your hordes to carry off plunder, to make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?’
13801	14	38	14	38	14	Therefore prophesy, son of man, and tell Gog that this is what the Lord GOD says: On that day when My people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not take notice of this?
13802	14	38	15	38	15	And you will come from your place out of the far north—you and many peoples with you, all riding horses—a mighty horde, a huge army.
13803	14	38	16	38	16	You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the latter days, O Gog, that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I show Myself holy in you before their eyes.
13804	14	38	17	38	17	This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you the one of whom I have spoken in former days through My servants, the prophets of Israel, who in those times prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?
13805	14	38	18	38	18	Now on that day, the day when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, My wrath will flare up.
13806	14	38	19	38	19	In My zeal and fiery rage I proclaim that on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
13807	14	38	20	38	20	The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, every creature that crawls upon the ground, and all mankind on the face of the earth will tremble at My presence. The mountains will be thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground.
13808	14	38	21	38	21	And I will summon a sword against Gog on all My mountains, declares the Lord GOD, and every man’s sword will be against his brother.
13809	14	38	22	38	22	I will execute judgment upon him with plague and bloodshed. I will pour out torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.
13810	14	38	23	38	23	I will magnify and sanctify Myself, and will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
13811	14	39	1	39	1	“As for you, O son of man, prophesy against Gog and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.
13812	14	39	2	39	2	I will turn you around, drive you along, bring you up from the far north, and send you against the mountains of Israel.
13813	14	39	3	39	3	Then I will strike the bow from your left hand and dash down the arrows from your right hand.
13814	14	39	4	39	4	On the mountains of Israel you will fall—you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to every kind of ravenous bird and wild beast.
13815	14	39	5	39	5	You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
13816	14	39	6	39	6	I will send fire against Magog and those who dwell securely in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the LORD.
13817	14	39	7	39	7	So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel and will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
13818	14	39	8	39	8	Yes, it is coming, and it will surely happen, declares the Lord GOD. This is the day of which I have spoken.
13819	14	39	9	39	9	Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out, kindle fires, and burn up the weapons—the bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel.
13820	14	39	10	39	10	They will not gather wood from the countryside or cut it from the forests, for they will use the weapons for fuel. They will loot those who looted them and plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD.
13821	14	39	11	39	11	And on that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Sea. It will block those who travel through, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
13822	14	39	12	39	12	For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.
13823	14	39	13	39	13	All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day I display My glory, declares the Lord GOD.
13824	14	39	14	39	14	And men will be employed to continually pass through the land to cleanse it by burying the invaders who remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months they will begin their search.
13825	14	39	15	39	15	As they pass through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will set up a pillar next to it, until the gravediggers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.
13826	14	39	16	39	16	(Even the city will be named Hamonah.) And so they will cleanse the land.
13827	14	39	17	39	17	And as for you, son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: Call out to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great feast on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood.
13828	14	39	18	39	18	You will eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—all the fattened animals of Bashan.
13829	14	39	19	39	19	At the sacrifice I am preparing, you will eat fat until you are gorged and drink blood until you are drunk.
13830	14	39	20	39	20	And at My table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, of mighty men and warriors of every kind,’ declares the Lord GOD.
13831	14	39	21	39	21	I will display My glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgment that I execute and the hand that I lay upon them.
13832	14	39	22	39	22	From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am the LORD their God.
13833	14	39	23	39	23	And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they were unfaithful to Me. So I hid My face from them and delivered them into the hands of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword.
13834	14	39	24	39	24	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions, and I hid My face from them.
13835	14	39	25	39	25	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Now I will restore Jacob from captivity and will have compassion on the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for My holy name.
13836	14	39	26	39	26	They will forget their disgrace and all the treachery they committed against Me, when they dwell securely in their land, with no one to frighten them.
13837	14	39	27	39	27	When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them out of the lands of their enemies, I will show My holiness in them in the sight of many nations.
13838	14	39	28	39	28	Then they will know that I am the LORD their God, when I regather them to their own land, not leaving any of them behind after their exile among the nations.
13839	14	39	29	39	29	And I will no longer hide My face from them, for I will pour out My Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”
13840	14	40	1	40	1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month—in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been struck down—on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He took me there.
13841	14	40	2	40	2	In visions of God He took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose southern slope was a structure that resembled a city.
13842	14	40	3	40	3	So He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze. He was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.
13843	14	40	4	40	4	“Son of man,” he said to me, “look with your eyes, hear with your ears, and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Report to the house of Israel everything you see.”
13844	14	40	5	40	5	And I saw a wall surrounding the temple area. Now the length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six long cubits (each measuring a cubit and a handbreadth), and he measured the wall to be one rod thick and one rod high.
13845	14	40	6	40	6	Then he came to the gate facing east and climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate to be one rod deep.
13846	14	40	7	40	7	Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide, and there were five cubits between the gate chambers. The inner threshold of the gate by the portico facing inward was one rod deep.
13847	14	40	8	40	8	Then he measured the portico of the gateway inside;
13848	14	40	9	40	9	it was eight cubits deep, and its jambs were two cubits thick. And the portico of the gateway faced the temple.
13849	14	40	10	40	10	There were three gate chambers on each side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the gateposts on either side also had the same measurements.
13850	14	40	11	40	11	And he measured the width of the gateway entrance to be ten cubits, and its length was thirteen cubits.
13851	14	40	12	40	12	In front of each gate chamber was a wall one cubit high, and the gate chambers were six cubits square.
13852	14	40	13	40	13	Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one gate chamber to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from doorway to doorway.
13853	14	40	14	40	14	Next he measured the gateposts to be sixty cubits high. The gateway extended around to the gatepost of the courtyard.
13854	14	40	15	40	15	And the distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its inner portico was fifty cubits.
13855	14	40	16	40	16	The gate chambers and their side pillars had beveled windows all around the inside of the gateway. The porticos also had windows all around on the inside. Each side pillar was decorated with palm trees.
13856	14	40	17	40	17	Then he brought me into the outer court, and there were chambers and a pavement laid out all around the court. Thirty chambers faced the pavement,
13857	14	40	18	40	18	which flanked the gateways and corresponded to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
13858	14	40	19	40	19	Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north.
13859	14	40	20	40	20	He also measured the length and width of the gateway of the outer court facing north.
13860	14	40	21	40	21	Its three gate chambers on each side, its side pillars, and its portico all had the same measurements as the first gate: fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
13861	14	40	22	40	22	Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them.
13862	14	40	23	40	23	There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured the distance from gateway to gateway to be a hundred cubits.
13863	14	40	24	40	24	Then he led me to the south side, and I saw a gateway facing south. He measured its side pillars and portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.
13864	14	40	25	40	25	Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
13865	14	40	26	40	26	Seven steps led up to it, and its portico was opposite them; it had palm trees on its side pillars, one on each side.
13866	14	40	27	40	27	The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured the distance from gateway to gateway toward the south to be a hundred cubits.
13867	14	40	28	40	28	Next he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.
13868	14	40	29	40	29	Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
13869	14	40	30	40	30	(The porticoes around the inner court were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits deep.)
13870	14	40	31	40	31	Its portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees. Eight steps led up to it.
13871	14	40	32	40	32	And he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others.
13872	14	40	33	40	33	Its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and its portico had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
13873	14	40	34	40	34	Its portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side. Eight steps led up to it.
13874	14	40	35	40	35	Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others,
13875	14	40	36	40	36	as did its gate chambers, side pillars, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
13876	14	40	37	40	37	Its portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side. Eight steps led up to it.
13877	14	40	38	40	38	There was a chamber with a doorway by the portico in each of the inner gateways. There the burnt offering was to be washed.
13878	14	40	39	40	39	Inside the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings were to be slaughtered.
13879	14	40	40	40	40	Outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gateway, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate’s portico.
13880	14	40	41	40	41	So there were four tables inside the gateway and four outside—eight tables in all—on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered.
13881	14	40	42	40	42	There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offering, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. On these were placed the utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.
13882	14	40	43	40	43	The double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were fastened all around the inside of the room, and the flesh of the offering was to be placed on the tables.
13883	14	40	44	40	44	Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two chambers, one beside the north gate and facing south, and another beside the south gate and facing north.
13884	14	40	45	40	45	Then the man said to me: “The chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple,
13885	14	40	46	40	46	and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the only Levites who may approach the LORD to minister before Him.”
13886	14	40	47	40	47	Next he measured the court. It was square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.
13887	14	40	48	40	48	Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the side pillars of the portico to be five cubits on each side. The width of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its sidewalls were three cubits on either side.
13888	14	40	49	40	49	The portico was twenty cubits wide and twelve cubits deep, and ten steps led up to it. There were columns by the side pillars, one on each side.
13889	14	41	1	41	1	Then the man brought me into the outer sanctuary and measured the side pillars to be six cubits wide on each side.
13890	14	41	2	41	2	The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. He also measured the length of the outer sanctuary to be forty cubits, and the width to be twenty cubits.
13891	14	41	3	41	3	And he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the side pillars at the entrance to be two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the walls on each side were seven cubits wide.
13892	14	41	4	41	4	Then he measured the room adjacent to the inner sanctuary to be twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. And he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”
13893	14	41	5	41	5	Next he measured the wall of the temple to be six cubits thick, and the width of each side room around the temple was four cubits.
13894	14	41	6	41	6	The side rooms were arranged one above another in three levels of thirty rooms each. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side rooms, so that the supports would not be fastened into the wall of the temple itself.
13895	14	41	7	41	7	The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive level, because the structure surrounding the temple ascended by stages corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall as it rose upward. And so a stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest, through the middle one.
13896	14	41	8	41	8	I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the full length of a rod, six long cubits.
13897	14	41	9	41	9	The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick, and the open area between the side rooms of the temple
13898	14	41	10	41	10	and the outer chambers was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.
13899	14	41	11	41	11	The side rooms opened into this area, with one entrance on the north and another on the south. The open area was five cubits wide all around.
13900	14	41	12	41	12	Now the building that faced the temple courtyard on the west was seventy cubits wide, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, with a length of ninety cubits.
13901	14	41	13	41	13	Then he measured the temple to be a hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long.
13902	14	41	14	41	14	The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits.
13903	14	41	15	41	15	Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porticoes facing the court,
13904	14	41	16	41	16	as well as the thresholds and the beveled windows and the galleries all around with their three levels opposite the threshold, were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were paneled from the ground to the windows, and the windows were covered.
13905	14	41	17	41	17	In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary on all the walls, spaced evenly around the inner and outer sanctuary,
13906	14	41	18	41	18	were alternating carved cherubim and palm trees. Each cherub had two faces:
13907	14	41	19	41	19	the face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion was toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all the way around the temple.
13908	14	41	20	41	20	Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the outer sanctuary from the floor to the space above the entrance.
13909	14	41	21	41	21	The outer sanctuary had a rectangular doorframe, and the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar.
13910	14	41	22	41	22	There was an altar of wood three cubits high and two cubits square. Its corners, base, and sides were of wood. And the man told me, “This is the table that is before the LORD.”
13911	14	41	23	41	23	Both the outer sanctuary and the inner sanctuary had double doors,
13912	14	41	24	41	24	and each door had two swinging panels. There were two panels for one door and two for the other.
13913	14	41	25	41	25	Cherubim and palm trees like those on the walls were carved on the doors of the outer sanctuary, and there was a wooden canopy outside, on the front of the portico.
13914	14	41	26	41	26	There were beveled windows and palm trees on the sidewalls of the portico. The side rooms of the temple also had canopies.
13915	14	42	1	42	1	Then the man led me out northward into the outer court, and he brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple courtyard and the outer wall on the north side.
13916	14	42	2	42	2	The building with the door facing north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.
13917	14	42	3	42	3	Gallery faced gallery in three levels opposite the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court and opposite the pavement that belonged to the outer court.
13918	14	42	4	42	4	In front of the chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.
13919	14	42	5	42	5	Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building.
13920	14	42	6	42	6	For they were arranged in three stories, and unlike the courts, they had no pillars. So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors.
13921	14	42	7	42	7	An outer wall in front of the chambers was fifty cubits long and ran parallel to the chambers and the outer court.
13922	14	42	8	42	8	For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits long.
13923	14	42	9	42	9	And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
13924	14	42	10	42	10	On the south side along the length of the wall of the outer court were chambers adjoining the courtyard and opposite the building,
13925	14	42	11	42	11	with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that were on the north. They had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions.
13926	14	42	12	42	12	And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, there was a door in front of the walkway that was parallel to the wall extending eastward.
13927	14	42	13	42	13	Then the man said to me, “The north and south chambers facing the temple courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy.
13928	14	42	14	42	14	Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court until they have left behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the places that are for the people.”
13929	14	42	15	42	15	Now when the man had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and he measured the area all around:
13930	14	42	16	42	16	With a measuring rod he measured the east side to be five hundred cubits long.
13931	14	42	17	42	17	He measured the north side to be five hundred cubits long.
13932	14	42	18	42	18	He measured the south side to be five hundred cubits long.
13933	14	42	19	42	19	And he came around and measured the west side to be five hundred cubits long.
13934	14	42	20	42	20	So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.
13935	14	43	1	43	1	Then the man brought me back to the gate that faces east,
13936	14	43	2	43	2	and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory.
13937	14	43	3	43	3	The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when He came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the River Kebar. I fell facedown,
13938	14	43	4	43	4	and the glory of the LORD entered the temple through the gate facing east.
13939	14	43	5	43	5	Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
13940	14	43	6	43	6	While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple,
13941	14	43	7	43	7	and He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will never again defile My holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and by the funeral offerings for their kings at their deaths.
13942	14	43	8	43	8	When they placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts beside My doorposts, with only a wall between Me and them, they defiled My holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore I have consumed them in My anger.
13943	14	43	9	43	9	Now let them remove far from Me their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will dwell among them forever.
13944	14	43	10	43	10	As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure the plan,
13945	14	43	11	43	11	and if they are ashamed of all they have done, then make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement and its exits and entrances—its whole design along with all its statutes, forms, and laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out.
13946	14	43	12	43	12	This is the law of the temple: All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be most holy. Yes, this is the law of the temple.
13947	14	43	13	43	13	These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits (a cubit and a handbreadth): Its gutter shall be a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this is the height of the altar:
13948	14	43	14	43	14	The space from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide. The space from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide.
13949	14	43	15	43	15	The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and four horns shall project upward from the hearth.
13950	14	43	16	43	16	The altar hearth shall be square at its four corners, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.
13951	14	43	17	43	17	The ledge shall also be square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim of half a cubit and a gutter of a cubit all around it. The steps of the altar shall face east.”
13952	14	43	18	43	18	Then He said to me: “Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it and blood may be sprinkled on it:
13953	14	43	19	43	19	You are to give a young bull from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are of the family of Zadok, who approach Me to minister before Me, declares the Lord GOD.
13954	14	43	20	43	20	You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim; thus you will cleanse the altar and make atonement for it.
13955	14	43	21	43	21	Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
13956	14	43	22	43	22	On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering, and the altar is to be cleansed as it was with the bull.
13957	14	43	23	43	23	When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock.
13958	14	43	24	43	24	You must present them before the LORD; the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.
13959	14	43	25	43	25	For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished.
13960	14	43	26	43	26	For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so they shall consecrate it.
13961	14	43	27	43	27	At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.’”
13962	14	44	1	44	1	The man then brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary that faced east, but it was shut.
13963	14	44	2	44	2	And the LORD said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it, because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will remain shut.
13964	14	44	3	44	3	Only the prince himself may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of the LORD. He must enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.”
13965	14	44	4	44	4	Then the man brought me to the front of the temple by way of the north gate. I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling His temple, and I fell facedown.
13966	14	44	5	44	5	The LORD said to me: “Son of man, pay attention; look carefully with your eyes and listen closely with your ears to everything I tell you concerning all the statutes and laws of the house of the LORD. Take careful note of the entrance to the temple, along with all the exits of the sanctuary.
13967	14	44	6	44	6	Tell the rebellious house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I have had enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel.
13968	14	44	7	44	7	In addition to all your other abominations, you brought in foreigners uncircumcised in both heart and flesh to occupy My sanctuary; you defiled My temple when you offered My food—the fat and the blood; you broke My covenant.
13969	14	44	8	44	8	And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but have appointed others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.’
13970	14	44	9	44	9	This is what the Lord GOD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh may enter My sanctuary—not even a foreigner who lives among the Israelites.
13971	14	44	10	44	10	Surely the Levites who wandered away from Me when Israel went astray, and who wandered away from Me after their idols, will bear the consequences of their iniquity.
13972	14	44	11	44	11	Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and ministering there. They shall slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people and stand before them to minister to them.
13973	14	44	12	44	12	Because they ministered before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I swore with an uplifted hand concerning them that they would bear the consequences of their iniquity, declares the Lord GOD.
13974	14	44	13	44	13	They must not approach Me to serve Me as priests or come near any of My holy things or the most holy things. They will bear the shame of the abominations they have committed.
13975	14	44	14	44	14	Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of all the work for the temple and everything to be done in it.
13976	14	44	15	44	15	But the Levitical priests, who are descended from Zadok and who kept charge of My sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from Me, are to approach Me to minister before Me. They will stand before Me to offer Me fat and blood, declares the Lord GOD.
13977	14	44	16	44	16	They alone shall enter My sanctuary and draw near to My table to minister before Me. They will keep My charge.
13978	14	44	17	44	17	When they enter the gates of the inner court, they are to wear linen garments; they must not wear anything made of wool when they minister at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.
13979	14	44	18	44	18	They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists. They must not wear anything that makes them perspire.
13980	14	44	19	44	19	When they go out to the outer court, to the people, they are to take off the garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and dress in other clothes so that they do not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.
13981	14	44	20	44	20	They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long, but must carefully trim their hair.
13982	14	44	21	44	21	No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court.
13983	14	44	22	44	22	And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but must marry a virgin of the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow of a priest.
13984	14	44	23	44	23	They are to teach My people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to discern between the clean and the unclean.
13985	14	44	24	44	24	In any dispute, they shall officiate as judges and judge according to My ordinances. They must keep My laws and statutes regarding all My appointed feasts, and they must keep My Sabbaths holy.
13986	14	44	25	44	25	A priest must not defile himself by going near a dead person. However, for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister, he may do so,
13987	14	44	26	44	26	and after he is cleansed, he must count off seven days for himself.
13988	14	44	27	44	27	And on the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD.
13989	14	44	28	44	28	In regard to their inheritance, I am their inheritance. You are to give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession.
13990	14	44	29	44	29	They shall eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Everything in Israel devoted to the LORD will belong to them.
13991	14	44	30	44	30	The best of all the firstfruits and of every contribution from all your offerings will belong to the priests. You are to give your first batch of dough to the priest, so that a blessing may rest upon your homes.
13992	14	44	31	44	31	The priests may not eat any bird or animal found dead or torn by wild beasts.”
13993	14	45	1	45	1	“When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance, you are to set aside a portion for the LORD, a holy portion of the land 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide. This entire tract of land will be holy.
13994	14	45	2	45	2	Within this area there is to be a section for the sanctuary 500 cubits square, with 50 cubits around it for open land.
13995	14	45	3	45	3	From this holy portion, you are to measure off a length of 25,000 cubits and a width of 10,000 cubits, and in it will be the sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
13996	14	45	4	45	4	It will be a holy portion of the land to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who draw near to minister before the LORD. It will be a place for their houses, as well as a holy area for the sanctuary.
13997	14	45	5	45	5	An adjacent area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide shall belong to the Levites who minister in the temple; it will be their possession for towns in which to live.
13998	14	45	6	45	6	As the property of the city, you are to set aside an area 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjacent to the holy district. It will belong to the whole house of Israel.
13999	14	45	7	45	7	Now the prince will have the area bordering each side of the area formed by the holy district and the property of the city, extending westward from the western side and eastward from the eastern side, running lengthwise from the western boundary to the eastern boundary and parallel to one of the tribal portions.
14000	14	45	8	45	8	This land will be his possession in Israel. And My princes will no longer oppress My people, but will give the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
14001	14	45	9	45	9	For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Enough, O princes of Israel! Cease your violence and oppression, and do what is just and right. Stop dispossessing My people, declares the Lord GOD.’
14002	14	45	10	45	10	You must use honest scales, a just ephah, and a just bath.
14003	14	45	11	45	11	The ephah and the bath shall be the same quantity so that the bath will contain a tenth of a homer, and the ephah a tenth of a homer; the homer will be the standard measure for both.
14004	14	45	12	45	12	The shekel will consist of twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels will equal one mina.
14005	14	45	13	45	13	This is the contribution you are to offer: a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.
14006	14	45	14	45	14	The prescribed portion of oil, measured by the bath, is a tenth of a bath from each cor (a cor consists of ten baths or one homer, since ten baths are equivalent to a homer).
14007	14	45	15	45	15	And one sheep shall be given from each flock of two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the people, declares the Lord GOD.
14008	14	45	16	45	16	All the people of the land must participate in this contribution for the prince in Israel.
14009	14	45	17	45	17	And it shall be the prince’s part to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths—for all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
14010	14	45	18	45	18	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘On the first day of the first month you are to take a young bull without blemish and purify the sanctuary.
14011	14	45	19	45	19	And the priest is to take some of the blood from the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.
14012	14	45	20	45	20	You must do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for anyone who strays unintentionally or in ignorance. In this way you will make atonement for the temple.
14013	14	45	21	45	21	On the fourteenth day of the first month you are to observe the Passover, a feast of seven days, during which unleavened bread shall be eaten.
14014	14	45	22	45	22	On that day the prince shall provide a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land.
14015	14	45	23	45	23	Each day during the seven days of the feast, he shall provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD, along with a male goat for a sin offering.
14016	14	45	24	45	24	He shall also provide as a grain offering an ephah for each bull and an ephah for each ram, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah of grain.
14017	14	45	25	45	25	During the seven days of the feast that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he is to make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and oil.’”
14018	14	46	1	46	1	“This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘The gate of the inner court that faces east must be kept shut during the six days of work, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon it shall be opened.
14019	14	46	2	46	2	The prince is to enter from the outside through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost, while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings. He is to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then depart, but the gate must not be shut until evening.
14020	14	46	3	46	3	On the Sabbaths and New Moons the people of the land are also to bow in worship before the LORD at the entrance to that gateway.
14021	14	46	4	46	4	The burnt offering that the prince presents to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six unblemished male lambs and an unblemished ram.
14022	14	46	5	46	5	The grain offering with the ram shall be one ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, along with a hin of oil per ephah.
14023	14	46	6	46	6	On the day of the New Moon he shall offer a young, unblemished bull, six lambs, and a ram without blemish.
14024	14	46	7	46	7	He is to provide a grain offering of an ephah with the bull, an ephah with the ram, and as much as he is able with the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah.
14025	14	46	8	46	8	When the prince enters, he shall go in through the portico of the gateway, and he shall go out the same way.
14026	14	46	9	46	9	When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by the north gate to worship must go out by the south gate, and whoever enters by the south gate must go out by the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which he entered, but each must go out by the opposite gate.
14027	14	46	10	46	10	When the people enter, the prince shall go in with them, and when they leave, he shall leave.
14028	14	46	11	46	11	At the festivals and appointed feasts, the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and as much as one is able to give with the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah.
14029	14	46	12	46	12	When the prince makes a freewill offering to the LORD, whether a burnt offering or a peace offering, the gate facing east must be opened for him. He is to offer his burnt offering or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out.
14030	14	46	13	46	13	And you shall provide an unblemished year-old lamb as a daily burnt offering to the LORD; you are to offer it every morning.
14031	14	46	14	46	14	You are also to provide with it every morning a grain offering of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to the LORD. This is a perpetual statute.
14032	14	46	15	46	15	Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.’
14033	14	46	16	46	16	This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons as an inheritance, it will belong to his descendants. It will become their property by inheritance.
14034	14	46	17	46	17	But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs only to his sons; it shall be theirs.
14035	14	46	18	46	18	The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people by evicting them from their property. He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that none of My people will be displaced from his property.’”
14036	14	46	19	46	19	Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate into the holy chambers facing north, which belonged to the priests, and he showed me a place there at the far western end
14037	14	46	20	46	20	and said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people.”
14038	14	46	21	46	21	Then he brought me into the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw a separate court in each of its corners.
14039	14	46	22	46	22	In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed courts, each forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Each of the four corner areas had the same dimensions.
14040	14	46	23	46	23	Around the inside of each of the four courts was a row of masonry with ovens built at the base of the walls on all sides.
14041	14	46	24	46	24	And he said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices offered by the people.”
14042	14	47	1	47	1	Then the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar.
14043	14	47	2	47	2	Next he brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and there I saw the water trickling out from the south side.
14044	14	47	3	47	3	As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and led me through ankle-deep water.
14045	14	47	4	47	4	Then he measured off a thousand cubits and led me through knee-deep water. Again he measured a thousand cubits and led me through waist-deep water.
14046	14	47	5	47	5	Once again he measured off a thousand cubits, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough for swimming—a river that could not be crossed on foot.
14047	14	47	6	47	6	“Son of man, do you see this?” he asked. Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
14048	14	47	7	47	7	When I arrived, I saw a great number of trees along both banks of the river.
14049	14	47	8	47	8	And he said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah. When it empties into the Sea, the water there becomes fresh.
14050	14	47	9	47	9	Wherever the river flows, there will be swarms of living creatures and a great number of fish, because it flows there and makes the waters fresh; so wherever the river flows, everything will flourish.
14051	14	47	10	47	10	Fishermen will stand by the shore; from En-gedi to En-eglaim they will spread their nets to catch fish of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.
14052	14	47	11	47	11	But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
14053	14	47	12	47	12	Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of all kinds will grow. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be used for food and their leaves for healing.”
14054	14	47	13	47	13	This is what the Lord GOD says: “These are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall receive two portions.
14055	14	47	14	47	14	You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with an uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers, this land will fall to you as an inheritance.
14056	14	47	15	47	15	This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side it will extend from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon through Lebo-hamath to Zedad,
14057	14	47	16	47	16	Berothah, and Sibraim (which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
14058	14	47	17	47	17	So the border will run from the Sea to Hazar-enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary.
14059	14	47	18	47	18	On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Eastern Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be the eastern boundary.
14060	14	47	19	47	19	On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This will be the southern boundary.
14061	14	47	20	47	20	And on the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western boundary.
14062	14	47	21	47	21	You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
14063	14	47	22	47	22	You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who dwell among you and who have children. You are to treat them as native-born Israelites; along with you, they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
14064	14	47	23	47	23	In whatever tribe a foreigner dwells, you are to assign his inheritance there, declares the Lord GOD.”
14065	14	48	1	48	1	“Now these are the names of the tribes: At the northern frontier, Dan will have one portion bordering the road of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath and running on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus with Hamath to the north, and extending from the east side to the west side.
14066	14	48	2	48	2	Asher will have one portion bordering the territory of Dan from east to west.
14067	14	48	3	48	3	Naphtali will have one portion bordering the territory of Asher from east to west.
14068	14	48	4	48	4	Manasseh will have one portion bordering the territory of Naphtali from east to west.
14069	14	48	5	48	5	Ephraim will have one portion bordering the territory of Manasseh from east to west.
14070	14	48	6	48	6	Reuben will have one portion bordering the territory of Ephraim from east to west.
14071	14	48	7	48	7	Judah will have one portion bordering the territory of Reuben from east to west.
14072	14	48	8	48	8	Bordering the territory of Judah, from east to west, will be the portion you are to set apart. It will be 25,000 cubits wide, and the length of a tribal portion from east to west. In the center will be the sanctuary.
14073	14	48	9	48	9	The special portion you set apart to the LORD shall be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide.
14074	14	48	10	48	10	This will be the holy portion for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side, and 25,000 cubits long on the south side. In the center will be the sanctuary of the LORD.
14075	14	48	11	48	11	It will be for the consecrated priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept My charge and did not go astray as the Levites did when the Israelites went astray.
14076	14	48	12	48	12	It will be a special portion for them set apart from the land, a most holy portion adjacent to the territory of the Levites.
14077	14	48	13	48	13	Bordering the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an area 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide. The whole length will be 25,000 cubits, and the width 10,000 cubits.
14078	14	48	14	48	14	They must not sell or exchange any of it, and they must not transfer this best part of the land, for it is holy to the LORD.
14079	14	48	15	48	15	The remaining area, 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, will be for common use by the city, for houses, and for pastureland. The city will be in the center of it
14080	14	48	16	48	16	and will have these measurements: 4,500 cubits on the north side, 4,500 cubits on the south side, 4,500 cubits on the east side, and 4,500 cubits on the west side.
14081	14	48	17	48	17	The pastureland of the city will extend 250 cubits to the north, 250 cubits to the south, 250 cubits to the east, and 250 cubits to the west.
14082	14	48	18	48	18	The remainder of the length bordering the holy portion and running adjacent to it will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side. Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city.
14083	14	48	19	48	19	The workers of the city who cultivate it will come from all the tribes of Israel.
14084	14	48	20	48	20	The entire portion will be a square, 25,000 cubits by 25,000 cubits. You are to set apart the holy portion, along with the city property.
14085	14	48	21	48	21	The remaining area on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city will belong to the prince. He will own the land adjacent to the tribal portions, extending eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the holy district toward the eastern border, and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border. And in the center of them will be the holy portion and the sanctuary of the temple.
14086	14	48	22	48	22	So the Levitical property and the city property will lie in the center of the area belonging to the prince—the area between the borders of Judah and Benjamin.
14087	14	48	23	48	23	As for the rest of the tribes: Benjamin will have one portion extending from the east side to the west side.
14088	14	48	24	48	24	Simeon will have one portion bordering the territory of Benjamin from east to west.
14089	14	48	25	48	25	Issachar will have one portion bordering the territory of Simeon from east to west.
14090	14	48	26	48	26	Zebulun will have one portion bordering the territory of Issachar from east to west.
14091	14	48	27	48	27	And Gad will have one portion bordering the territory of Zebulun from east to west.
14092	14	48	28	48	28	The southern border of Gad will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, then along the Brook of Egypt and out to the Great Sea.
14093	14	48	29	48	29	This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,” declares the Lord GOD.
14094	14	48	30	48	30	“These will be the exits of the city: Beginning on the north side, which will be 4,500 cubits long,
14095	14	48	31	48	31	the gates of the city will be named after the tribes of Israel. On the north side there will be three gates: the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi.
14096	14	48	32	48	32	On the east side, which will be 4,500 cubits long, there will be three gates: the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan.
14097	14	48	33	48	33	On the south side, which will be 4,500 cubits long, there will be three gates: the gate of Simeon, the gate of Issachar, and the gate of Zebulun.
14098	14	48	34	48	34	And on the west side, which will be 4,500 cubits long, there will be three gates: the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher, and the gate of Naphtali.
14099	14	48	35	48	35	The perimeter of the city will be 18,000 cubits, and from that day on the name of the city will be: THE LORD IS THERE.”
14100	15	1	1	1	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel.
14101	15	1	2	1	2	When the LORD first spoke to Hosea, He told him, “Go, take a prostitute as your wife and have children of adultery, because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself by departing from the LORD.”
14102	15	1	3	1	3	So Hosea went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
14103	15	1	4	1	4	Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Name him Jezreel, for soon I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel.
14104	15	1	5	1	5	And on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
14105	15	1	6	1	6	Gomer again conceived and gave birth to a daughter, and the LORD said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I should ever forgive them.
14106	15	1	7	1	7	Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will save them—not by bow or sword or war, not by horses and cavalry, but by the LORD their God.”
14107	15	1	8	1	8	After she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, Gomer conceived and gave birth to a son.
14108	15	1	9	1	9	And the LORD said, “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not your God.
14109	15	2	1	1	10	Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And it will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’
14110	15	2	2	1	11	Then the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one leader, and will go up out of the land. For great will be the day of Jezreel.”
14111	15	2	3	2	1	“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’ and of your sisters, ‘My loved one.’
14112	15	2	4	2	2	Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not My wife, and I am not her husband. Let her remove the adultery from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
14113	15	2	5	2	3	Otherwise, I will strip her naked and expose her like the day of her birth. I will make her like a desert and turn her into a parched land, and I will let her die of thirst.
14114	15	2	6	2	4	I will have no compassion on her children, because they are the children of adultery.
14115	15	2	7	2	5	For their mother has played the harlot and has conceived them in disgrace. For she thought, ‘I will go after my lovers, who give me bread and water, wool and linen, oil and drink.’
14116	15	2	8	2	6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her path with thorns; I will enclose her with a wall, so she cannot find her way.
14117	15	2	9	2	7	She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; she will seek them but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will return to my first husband, for then I was better off than now.’
14118	15	2	10	2	8	For she does not acknowledge that it was I who gave her grain, new wine, and oil, who lavished on her silver and gold—which they crafted for Baal.
14119	15	2	11	2	9	Therefore I will take back My grain in its time and My new wine in its season; I will take away My wool and linen, which were given to cover her nakedness.
14120	15	2	12	2	10	And then I will expose her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her out of My hands.
14121	15	2	13	2	11	I will put an end to all her exultation: her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths—all her appointed feasts.
14122	15	2	14	2	12	I will destroy her vines and fig trees, which she thinks are the wages paid by her lovers. So I will make them into a thicket, and the beasts of the field will devour them.
14123	15	2	15	2	13	I will punish her for the days of the Baals when she burned incense to them, when she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers. But Me she forgot,” declares the LORD.
14124	15	2	16	2	14	“Therefore, behold, I will allure her and lead her to the wilderness, and speak to her tenderly.
14125	15	2	17	2	15	There I will give back her vineyards and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope. There she will respond as she did in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
14126	15	2	18	2	16	In that day,” declares the LORD, “you will call Me ‘my Husband,’ and no longer call Me ‘my Master.’
14127	15	2	19	2	17	For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals; no longer will their names be invoked.
14128	15	2	20	2	18	On that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that crawl on the ground. And I will abolish bow and sword and weapons of war in the land, and will make them lie down in safety.
14129	15	2	21	2	19	So I will betroth you to Me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in loving devotion and compassion.
14130	15	2	22	2	20	And I will betroth you in faithfulness, and you will know the LORD.”
14131	15	2	23	2	21	“On that day I will respond—” declares the LORD—“I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth.
14132	15	2	24	2	22	And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
14133	15	2	25	2	23	And I will sow her as My own in the land, and I will have compassion on ‘No Compassion.’ I will say to those called ‘Not My People,’ ‘You are My people,’ and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”
14134	15	3	1	3	1	Then the LORD said to me, “Go show love to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and offer raisin cakes to idols.”
14135	15	3	2	3	2	So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.
14136	15	3	3	3	3	Then I said to her, “You must live with me for many days; you must not be promiscuous or belong to another, and I will do the same for you.”
14137	15	3	4	3	4	For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without ephod or idol.
14138	15	3	5	3	5	Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
14139	15	4	1	4	1	Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel, for the LORD has a case against the people of the land: “There is no truth, no loving devotion, and no knowledge of God in the land!
14140	15	4	2	4	2	Cursing and lying, murder and stealing, and adultery are rampant; one act of bloodshed follows another.
14141	15	4	3	4	3	Therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it will waste away with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air; even the fish of the sea disappear.
14142	15	4	4	4	4	But let no man contend; let no man offer reproof; for your people are like those who contend with a priest.
14143	15	4	5	4	5	You will stumble by day, and the prophet will stumble with you by night. So I will destroy your mother—
14144	15	4	6	4	6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you as My priests. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.
14145	15	4	7	4	7	The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; they exchanged their Glory for a thing of disgrace.
14146	15	4	8	4	8	They feed on the sins of My people and set their hearts on iniquity.
14147	15	4	9	4	9	And it shall be like people, like priest. I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.
14148	15	4	10	4	10	They will eat but not be satisfied; they will be promiscuous but not multiply. For they have stopped obeying the LORD.
14149	15	4	11	4	11	Promiscuity, wine, and new wine take away understanding.
14150	15	4	12	4	12	My people consult their wooden idols, and their divining rods inform them. For a spirit of prostitution leads them astray and they have played the harlot against their God.
14151	15	4	13	4	13	They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is pleasant. And so your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
14152	15	4	14	4	14	I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go off with prostitutes and offer sacrifices with cult prostitutes. So a people without understanding will come to ruin.
14153	15	4	15	4	15	Though you prostitute yourself, O Israel, may Judah avoid such guilt! Do not journey to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth-aven, and do not swear on oath, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’
14154	15	4	16	4	16	For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn heifer. Can the LORD now shepherd them like lambs in an open meadow?
14155	15	4	17	4	17	Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!
14156	15	4	18	4	18	When their liquor is gone, they turn to prostitution; their rulers dearly love disgrace.
14157	15	4	19	4	19	The whirlwind has wrapped them in its wings, and their sacrifices will bring them shame.”
14158	15	5	1	5	1	“Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O royal house! For this judgment is against you because you have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor.
14159	15	5	2	5	2	The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I will chastise them all.
14160	15	5	3	5	3	I know all about Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me. For now, O Ephraim, you have turned to prostitution; Israel is defiled.
14161	15	5	4	5	4	Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God, for a spirit of prostitution is within them, and they do not know the LORD.
14162	15	5	5	5	5	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them; Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; even Judah stumbles with them.
14163	15	5	6	5	6	They go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, but they do not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
14164	15	5	7	5	7	They have been unfaithful to the LORD; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the New Moon will devour them along with their land.
14165	15	5	8	5	8	Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; raise the battle cry in Beth-aven: Lead on, O Benjamin!
14166	15	5	9	5	9	Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain.
14167	15	5	10	5	10	The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary stones; I will pour out My fury upon them like water.
14168	15	5	11	5	11	Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, for he is determined to follow worthless idols.
14169	15	5	12	5	12	So I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like decay to the house of Judah.
14170	15	5	13	5	13	When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, then Ephraim turned to Assyria and sent to the great king. But he cannot cure you or heal your wound.
14171	15	5	14	5	14	For I am like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them to pieces and then go away. I will carry them off where no one can rescue them.
14172	15	5	15	5	15	Then I will return to My place until they admit their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.”
14173	15	6	1	6	1	Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.
14174	15	6	2	6	2	After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.
14175	15	6	3	6	3	So let us know—let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.
14176	15	6	4	6	4	What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes.
14177	15	6	5	6	5	Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth, and My judgments go forth like lightning.
14178	15	6	6	6	6	For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
14179	15	6	7	6	7	But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; there they were unfaithful to Me.
14180	15	6	8	6	8	Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood.
14181	15	6	9	6	9	Like raiders who lie in ambush, so does a band of priests; they murder on the way to Shechem; surely they have committed atrocities.
14182	15	6	10	6	10	In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled.
14183	15	6	11	6	11	Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.
14184	15	7	1	7	1	When I heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim will be exposed, as well as the crimes of Samaria. For they practice deceit and thieves break in; bandits raid in the streets.
14185	15	7	2	7	2	But they fail to consider in their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds are all around them; they are before My face.
14186	15	7	3	7	3	They delight the king with their evil, and the princes with their lies.
14187	15	7	4	7	4	They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by a baker who needs not stoke the fire from the kneading to the rising of the dough.
14188	15	7	5	7	5	The princes are inflamed with wine on the day of our king; so he joins hands with those who mock him.
14189	15	7	6	7	6	For they prepare their heart like an oven while they lie in wait; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
14190	15	7	7	7	7	All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls upon Me.
14191	15	7	8	7	8	Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is an unturned cake.
14192	15	7	9	7	9	Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not know.
14193	15	7	10	7	10	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the LORD their God; despite all this, they do not seek Him.
14194	15	7	11	7	11	So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove—calling out to Egypt, then turning to Assyria.
14195	15	7	12	7	12	As they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the air. I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together.
14196	15	7	13	7	13	Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against Me! Though I would redeem them, they speak lies against Me.
14197	15	7	14	7	14	They do not cry out to Me from their hearts when they wail upon their beds. They slash themselves for grain and new wine, but turn away from Me.
14198	15	7	15	7	15	Although I trained and strengthened their arms, they plot evil against Me.
14199	15	7	16	7	16	They turn, but not to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword for the cursing of their tongue; for this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.
14200	15	8	1	8	1	Put the ram’s horn to your lips! An eagle looms over the house of the LORD, because the people have transgressed My covenant and rebelled against My law.
14201	15	8	2	8	2	Israel cries out to Me, “O our God, we know You!”
14202	15	8	3	8	3	But Israel has rejected good; an enemy will pursue him.
14203	15	8	4	8	4	They set up kings, but not by Me. They make princes, but without My approval. With their silver and gold they make themselves idols, to their own destruction.
14204	15	8	5	8	5	He has rejected your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?
14205	15	8	6	8	6	For this thing is from Israel—a craftsman made it, and it is not God. It will be broken to pieces, that calf of Samaria.
14206	15	8	7	8	7	Indeed, they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if it should produce, the foreigners would swallow it up.
14207	15	8	8	8	8	Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like a worthless vessel.
14208	15	8	9	8	9	For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey on its own. Ephraim has hired lovers.
14209	15	8	10	8	10	Though they hire allies among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to diminish under the oppression of the king of princes.
14210	15	8	11	8	11	Though Ephraim multiplied the altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning.
14211	15	8	12	8	12	Though I wrote for them the great things of My law, they regarded them as something strange.
14212	15	8	13	8	13	Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to Me, and though they eat the meat, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.
14213	15	8	14	8	14	Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has multiplied its fortified cities. But I will send fire upon their cities, and it will consume their citadels.
14214	15	9	1	9	1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations, for you have played the harlot against your God; you have made love for hire on every threshing floor.
14215	15	9	2	9	2	The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, and the new wine will fail them.
14216	15	9	3	9	3	They will not remain in the land of the LORD; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.
14217	15	9	4	9	4	They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, and their sacrifices will not please Him, but will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat will be defiled. For their bread will be for themselves; it will not enter the house of the LORD.
14218	15	9	5	9	5	What will you do on the appointed day, on the day of the LORD’s feast?
14219	15	9	6	9	6	For even if they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them and Memphis will bury them. Their precious silver will be taken over by thistles, and thorns will overrun their tents.
14220	15	9	7	9	7	The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have arrived—let Israel know it. The prophet is called a fool, and the inspired man insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and hostility.
14221	15	9	8	9	8	The prophet is Ephraim’s watchman, along with my God, yet the snare of the fowler lies on all his paths. Hostility is in the house of his God!
14222	15	9	9	9	9	They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their guilt; He will punish their sins.
14223	15	9	10	9	10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the firstfruits of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to Shame; so they became as detestable as the thing they loved.
14224	15	9	11	9	11	Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird, with no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.
14225	15	9	12	9	12	Even if they raise their children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe be to them when I turn away from them!
14226	15	9	13	9	13	I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a meadow. But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.
14227	15	9	14	9	14	Give them, O LORD—what will You give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up!
14228	15	9	15	9	15	All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious.
14229	15	9	16	9	16	Ephraim is struck down; their root is withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay the darlings of their wombs.
14230	15	9	17	9	17	My God will reject them because they have not obeyed Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
14231	15	10	1	10	1	Israel was a luxuriant vine, yielding fruit for himself. The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars. The better his land produced, the better he made the sacred pillars.
14232	15	10	2	10	2	Their hearts are devious; now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars and demolish their sacred pillars.
14233	15	10	3	10	3	Surely now they will say, “We have no king, for we do not revere the LORD. What can a king do for us?”
14234	15	10	4	10	4	They speak mere words; with false oaths they make covenants. So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
14235	15	10	5	10	5	The people of Samaria will fear for the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn with its idolatrous priests—those who rejoiced in its glory—for it has been taken from them into exile.
14236	15	10	6	10	6	Yes, it will be carried to Assyria as tribute to the great king. Ephraim will be seized with shame; Israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols.
14237	15	10	7	10	7	Samaria will be carried off with her king like a twig on the surface of the water.
14238	15	10	8	10	8	The high places of Aven will be destroyed—it is the sin of Israel; thorns and thistles will overgrow their altars. Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
14239	15	10	9	10	9	Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel, and there you have remained. Did not the battle in Gibeah overtake the sons of iniquity?
14240	15	10	10	10	10	I will chasten them when I please; nations will be gathered against them to put them in bondage for their double transgression.
14241	15	10	11	10	11	Ephraim is a well-trained heifer that loves to thresh; but I will place a yoke on her fair neck. I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, and Jacob will break the hard ground.
14242	15	10	12	10	12	Sow for yourselves righteousness and reap the fruit of loving devotion; break up your unplowed ground. For it is time to seek the LORD until He comes and sends righteousness upon you like rain.
14243	15	10	13	10	13	You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice; you have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your own way and in the multitude of your mighty men,
14244	15	10	14	10	14	the roar of battle will rise against your people, so that all your fortresses will be demolished as Shalman devastated Beth-arbel in the day of battle, when mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.
14245	15	10	15	10	15	Thus it will be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. When the day dawns, the king of Israel will be utterly cut off.
14246	15	11	1	11	1	When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.
14247	15	11	2	11	2	But the more I called Israel, the farther they departed from Me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.
14248	15	11	3	11	3	It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.
14249	15	11	4	11	4	I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.
14250	15	11	5	11	5	Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?
14251	15	11	6	11	6	A sword will flash through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.
14252	15	11	7	11	7	My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.
14253	15	11	8	11	8	How could I give you up, O Ephraim? How could I surrender you, O Israel? How could I make you like Admah? How could I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!
14254	15	11	9	11	9	I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man—the Holy One among you—and I will not come in wrath.
14255	15	11	10	11	10	They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.
14256	15	11	11	11	11	They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.
14257	15	12	1	11	12	Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
14258	15	12	2	12	1	Ephraim chases the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; he multiplies lies and violence; he makes a covenant with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.
14259	15	12	3	12	2	The LORD also brings a charge against Judah. He will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.
14260	15	12	4	12	3	In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel, and in his vigor he wrestled with God.
14261	15	12	5	12	4	Yes, he struggled with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor; he found Him at Bethel and spoke with Him there—
14262	15	12	6	12	5	the LORD is the God of Hosts—the LORD is His name of renown.
14263	15	12	7	12	6	But you must return to your God, maintaining love and justice, and always waiting on your God.
14264	15	12	8	12	7	A merchant loves to defraud with dishonest scales in his hands.
14265	15	12	9	12	8	And Ephraim boasts: “How rich I have become; I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they can find in me no iniquity that is sinful.”
14266	15	12	10	12	9	But I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.
14267	15	12	11	12	10	I spoke through the prophets and multiplied their visions; I gave parables through the prophets.
14268	15	12	12	12	11	Is there iniquity in Gilead? They will surely come to nothing. Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.
14269	15	12	13	12	12	Jacob fled to the land of Aram and Israel worked for a wife—for a wife he tended sheep.
14270	15	12	14	12	13	But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.
14271	15	12	15	12	14	Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his contempt.
14272	15	13	1	13	1	When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he was exalted in Israel. But he incurred guilt through Baal, and he died.
14273	15	13	2	13	2	Now they sin more and more and make for themselves cast images, idols skillfully made from their silver, all of them the work of craftsmen. People say of them, “They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves!”
14274	15	13	3	13	3	Therefore they will be like the morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes, like chaff blown from a threshing floor, like smoke through an open window.
14275	15	13	4	13	4	Yet I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but Me, for there is no Savior besides Me.
14276	15	13	5	13	5	I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
14277	15	13	6	13	6	When they had pasture, they became satisfied; when they were satisfied, their hearts became proud, and as a result they forgot Me.
14278	15	13	7	13	7	So like a lion I will pounce on them; like a leopard I will lurk by the path.
14279	15	13	8	13	8	Like a bear robbed of her cubs I will attack them, and I will tear open their chests. There I will devour them like a lion, like a wild beast would tear them apart.
14280	15	13	9	13	9	You are destroyed, O Israel, because you are against Me—against your helper.
14281	15	13	10	13	10	Where is your king now to save you in all your cities, and the rulers to whom you said, “Give me a king and princes”?
14282	15	13	11	13	11	So in My anger I gave you a king, and in My wrath I took him away.
14283	15	13	12	13	12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is stored up.
14284	15	13	13	13	13	Labor pains come upon him, but he is an unwise son. When the time arrives, he fails to present himself at the opening of the womb.
14285	15	13	14	13	14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from Death. Where, O Death, are your plagues? Where, O Sheol, is your sting? Compassion is hidden from My eyes.
14286	15	13	15	13	15	Although he flourishes among his brothers, an east wind will come—a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert. His fountain will fail, and his spring will run dry. The wind will plunder his treasury of every precious article.
14287	15	14	1	13	16	Samaria will bear her guilt because she has rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.
14288	15	14	2	14	1	Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God, for you have stumbled by your iniquity.
14289	15	14	3	14	2	Bring your confessions and return to the LORD. Say to Him: “Take away all our iniquity and receive us graciously, that we may present the fruit of our lips.
14290	15	14	4	14	3	Assyria will not save us, nor will we ride on horses. We will never again say, ‘Our gods!’ to the work of our own hands. For in You the fatherless find compassion.”
14291	15	14	5	14	4	I will heal their apostasy; I will freely love them, for My anger has turned away from them.
14292	15	14	6	14	5	I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
14293	15	14	7	14	6	His shoots will sprout, and his splendor will be like the olive tree, his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.
14294	15	14	8	14	7	They will return and dwell in his shade; they will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
14295	15	14	9	14	8	O Ephraim, what have I to do anymore with idols? It is I who answer and watch over him. I am like a green cypress tree; your fruit comes from Me.
14296	15	14	10	14	9	Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them but the rebellious stumble in them.
14297	16	1	1	1	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
14298	16	1	2	1	2	Hear this, O elders; and give ear, all who dwell in the land. Has anything like this ever happened in your days or in the days of your fathers?
14299	16	1	3	1	3	Tell it to your children; let your children tell it to their children, and their children to the next generation.
14300	16	1	4	1	4	What the devouring locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten; and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten.
14301	16	1	5	1	5	Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth.
14302	16	1	6	1	6	For a nation has invaded My land, powerful and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and its fangs are the fangs of a lioness.
14303	16	1	7	1	7	It has laid waste My grapevine and splintered My fig tree. It has stripped off the bark and thrown it away; the branches have turned white.
14304	16	1	8	1	8	Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth, grieving for the husband of her youth.
14305	16	1	9	1	9	Grain and drink offerings have been cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests are in mourning, those who minister before the LORD.
14306	16	1	10	1	10	The field is ruined; the land mourns. For the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, and the oil fails.
14307	16	1	11	1	11	Be dismayed, O farmers, wail, O vinedressers, over the wheat and barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.
14308	16	1	12	1	12	The grapevine is dried up, and the fig tree is withered; the pomegranate, palm, and apple—all the trees of the orchard—are withered. Surely the joy of mankind has dried up.
14309	16	1	13	1	13	Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests; wail, O ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, O ministers of my God, because the grain and drink offerings are withheld from the house of your God.
14310	16	1	14	1	14	Consecrate a fast; proclaim a solemn assembly! Gather the elders and all the residents of the land to the house of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.
14311	16	1	15	1	15	Alas for the day! For the Day of the LORD is near, and it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
14312	16	1	16	1	16	Has not the food been cut off before our very eyes—joy and gladness from the house of our God?
14313	16	1	17	1	17	The seeds lie shriveled beneath the clods; the storehouses are in ruins; the granaries are broken down, for the grain has withered away.
14314	16	1	18	1	18	How the cattle groan! The herds wander in confusion because they have no pasture. Even the flocks of sheep are suffering.
14315	16	1	19	1	19	To You, O LORD, I call, for fire has consumed the open pastures and flames have scorched all the trees of the field.
14316	16	1	20	1	20	Even the beasts of the field pant for You, for the streams of water have dried up, and fire has consumed the open pastures.
14317	16	2	1	2	1	Blow the ram’s horn in Zion; sound the alarm on My holy mountain! Let all who dwell in the land tremble, for the Day of the LORD is coming; indeed, it is near—
14318	16	2	2	2	2	a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness. Like the dawn overspreading the mountains a great and strong army appears, such as never was of old, nor will ever be in ages to come.
14319	16	2	3	2	3	Before them a fire devours, and behind them a flame scorches. The land before them is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them, it is like a desert wasteland—surely nothing will escape them.
14320	16	2	4	2	4	Their appearance is like that of horses, and they gallop like swift steeds.
14321	16	2	5	2	5	With a sound like that of chariots they bound over the mountaintops, like the crackling of fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army deployed for battle.
14322	16	2	6	2	6	Nations writhe in horror before them; every face turns pale.
14323	16	2	7	2	7	They charge like mighty men; they scale the walls like men of war. Each one marches in formation, not swerving from the course.
14324	16	2	8	2	8	They do not jostle one another; each proceeds in his path. They burst through the defenses, never breaking ranks.
14325	16	2	9	2	9	They storm the city; they run along the wall; they climb into houses, entering through windows like thieves.
14326	16	2	10	2	10	Before them the earth quakes; the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars lose their brightness.
14327	16	2	11	2	11	The LORD raises His voice in the presence of His army. Indeed, His camp is very large, for mighty are those who obey His command. For the Day of the LORD is great and very dreadful. Who can endure it?
14328	16	2	12	2	12	“Yet even now,” declares the LORD, “return to Me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.”
14329	16	2	13	2	13	So rend your hearts and not your garments, and return to the LORD your God. For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion. And He relents from sending disaster.
14330	16	2	14	2	14	Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing behind Him—grain and drink offerings for the LORD your God.
14331	16	2	15	2	15	Blow the ram’s horn in Zion, consecrate a fast, proclaim a sacred assembly.
14332	16	2	16	2	16	Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the aged, gather the children, even those nursing at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber.
14333	16	2	17	2	17	Let the priests who minister before the LORD weep between the portico and the altar, saying, “Spare Your people, O LORD, and do not make Your heritage a reproach, an object of scorn among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where is their God?’”
14334	16	2	18	2	18	Then the LORD became jealous for His land, and He spared His people.
14335	16	2	19	2	19	And the LORD answered His people: “Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, and by them you will be satisfied. I will never again make you a reproach among the nations.
14336	16	2	20	2	20	The northern army I will drive away from you, banishing it to a barren and desolate land, its front ranks into the Eastern Sea, and its rear guard into the Western Sea. And its stench will rise; its foul odor will ascend. For He has done great things.
14337	16	2	21	2	21	Do not be afraid, O land; rejoice and be glad, for the LORD has done great things.
14338	16	2	22	2	22	Do not be afraid, O beasts of the field, for the open pastures have turned green, the trees bear their fruit, and the fig tree and vine yield their best.
14339	16	2	23	2	23	Be glad, O children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God, for He has given you the autumn rains for your vindication. He sends you showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
14340	16	2	24	2	24	The threshing floors will be full of grain, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.
14341	16	2	25	2	25	I will repay you for the years eaten by locusts—the swarming locust, the young locust, the destroying locust, and the devouring locust—My great army that I sent against you.
14342	16	2	26	2	26	You will have plenty to eat, until you are satisfied. You will praise the name of the LORD your God, who has worked wonders for you. My people will never again be put to shame.
14343	16	2	27	2	27	Then you will know that I am present in Israel and that I am the LORD your God, and there is no other. My people will never again be put to shame.
14344	16	3	1	2	28	And afterward, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
14345	16	3	2	2	29	Even on My menservants and maidservants, I will pour out My Spirit in those days.
14346	16	3	3	2	30	I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke.
14347	16	3	4	2	31	The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and awesome Day of the LORD.
14348	16	3	5	2	32	And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has promised, among the remnant called by the LORD.”
14349	16	4	1	3	1	“Yes, in those days and at that time, when I restore Judah and Jerusalem from captivity,
14350	16	4	2	3	2	I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. There I will enter into judgment against them concerning My people, My inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations as they divided up My land.
14351	16	4	3	3	3	They cast lots for My people; they bartered a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine to drink.
14352	16	4	4	3	4	Now what do you have against Me, O Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering against Me a recompense? If you retaliate against Me, I will swiftly and speedily return your recompense upon your heads.
14353	16	4	5	3	5	For you took My silver and gold and carried off My finest treasures to your temples.
14354	16	4	6	3	6	You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, to send them far from their homeland.
14355	16	4	7	3	7	Behold, I will rouse them from the places to which you sold them; I will return your recompense upon your heads.
14356	16	4	8	3	8	I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans—to a distant nation.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken.
14357	16	4	9	3	9	Proclaim this among the nations: “Prepare for war; rouse the mighty men; let all the men of war advance and attack!
14358	16	4	10	3	10	Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, ‘I am strong!’
14359	16	4	11	3	11	Come quickly, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves. Bring down Your mighty ones, O LORD.
14360	16	4	12	3	12	Let the nations be roused and advance to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit down to judge all the nations on every side.
14361	16	4	13	3	13	Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full; the wine vats overflow because their wickedness is great.
14362	16	4	14	3	14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the Day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.
14363	16	4	15	3	15	The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will no longer shine.
14364	16	4	16	3	16	The LORD will roar from Zion and raise His voice from Jerusalem; heaven and earth will tremble. But the LORD will be a refuge for His people, a stronghold for the people of Israel.
14365	16	4	17	3	17	Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, My holy mountain. Jerusalem will be holy, never again to be overrun by foreigners.
14366	16	4	18	3	18	And in that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with milk. All the streams of Judah will run with water, and a spring will flow from the house of the LORD to water the Valley of Acacias.
14367	16	4	19	3	19	Egypt will become desolate, and Edom a desert wasteland, because of the violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.
14368	16	4	20	3	20	But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
14369	16	4	21	3	21	For I will avenge their blood, which I have not yet avenged.” For the LORD dwells in Zion.
14370	17	1	1	1	1	These are the words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders of Tekoa—what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, in the days when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.
14371	17	1	2	1	2	He said: “The LORD roars from Zion and raises His voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the summit of Carmel withers.”
14372	17	1	3	1	3	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Damascus, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they threshed Gilead with sledges of iron.
14373	17	1	4	1	4	So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael to consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.
14374	17	1	5	1	5	I will break down the gates of Damascus and cut off the ruler of the Valley of Aven and him who wields the scepter from Beth-eden. The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,” says the LORD.
14375	17	1	6	1	6	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Gaza, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they exiled a whole population, delivering them up to Edom.
14376	17	1	7	1	7	So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza, to consume its citadels.
14377	17	1	8	1	8	I will cut off the ruler from Ashdod and him who wields the scepter from Ashkelon. I will turn My hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,” says the Lord GOD.
14378	17	1	9	1	9	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Tyre, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edom and broke a covenant of brotherhood.
14379	17	1	10	1	10	So I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre to consume its citadels.”
14380	17	1	11	1	11	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Edom, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he pursued his brother with the sword and stifled all compassion; his anger raged continually, and his fury flamed incessantly.
14381	17	1	12	1	12	So I will send fire upon Teman to consume the citadels of Bozrah.”
14382	17	1	13	1	13	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their territory.
14383	17	1	14	1	14	So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah to consume its citadels amid war cries on the day of battle and a violent wind on the day of tempest.
14384	17	1	15	1	15	Their king will go into exile—he and his princes together,” says the LORD.
14385	17	2	1	2	1	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he burned to lime the bones of Edom’s king.
14386	17	2	2	2	2	So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn.
14387	17	2	3	2	3	I will cut off the ruler from Moab and kill all the officials with him,” says the LORD.
14388	17	2	4	2	4	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they reject the Law of the LORD and fail to keep His statutes; they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked.
14389	17	2	5	2	5	So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”
14390	17	2	6	2	6	This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.
14391	17	2	7	2	7	They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name.
14392	17	2	8	2	8	They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God, they drink wine obtained through fines.
14393	17	2	9	2	9	Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, though his height was like that of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.
14394	17	2	10	2	10	And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.
14395	17	2	11	2	11	I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?” declares the LORD.
14396	17	2	12	2	12	“But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.
14397	17	2	13	2	13	Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as with a cart full of grain.
14398	17	2	14	2	14	Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life.
14399	17	2	15	2	15	The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.
14400	17	2	16	2	16	Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,” declares the LORD.
14401	17	3	1	3	1	Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the entire clan that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
14402	17	3	2	3	2	“Only you have I known from all the clans of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”
14403	17	3	3	3	3	Can two walk together without agreeing where to go?
14404	17	3	4	3	4	Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?
14405	17	3	5	3	5	Does a bird land in a snare where no bait has been set? Does a trap spring from the ground when it has nothing to catch?
14406	17	3	6	3	6	If a ram’s horn sounds in a city, do the people not tremble? If calamity comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?
14407	17	3	7	3	7	Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.
14408	17	3	8	3	8	The lion has roared—who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken—who will not prophesy?
14409	17	3	9	3	9	Proclaim to the citadels of Ashdod and to the citadels of Egypt: “Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; see the great unrest in the city and the acts of oppression in her midst.”
14410	17	3	10	3	10	“For they know not how to do right,” declares the LORD. “They store up violence and destruction in their citadels.”
14411	17	3	11	3	11	Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “An enemy will surround the land; he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your citadels.”
14412	17	3	12	3	12	This is what the LORD says: “As the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear, so the Israelites dwelling in Samaria will be rescued having just the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch.
14413	17	3	13	3	13	Hear and testify against the house of Jacob, declares the Lord GOD, the God of Hosts.
14414	17	3	14	3	14	On the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off, and they will fall to the ground.
14415	17	3	15	3	15	I will tear down the winter house along with the summer house; the houses of ivory will also perish, and the great houses will come to an end,” declares the LORD.
14416	17	4	1	4	1	Hear this word, you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, who say to your husbands, “Bring us more to drink.”
14417	17	4	2	4	2	The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness: “Behold, the days are coming when you will be taken away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
14418	17	4	3	4	3	You will go out through broken walls, each one straight ahead of her, and you will be cast out toward Harmon,” declares the LORD.
14419	17	4	4	4	4	“Go to Bethel and transgress; rebel even more at Gilgal! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days.
14420	17	4	5	4	5	Offer leavened bread as a thank offering, and loudly proclaim your freewill offerings. For that is what you children of Israel love to do,” declares the LORD GOD.
14421	17	4	6	4	6	“I beset all your cities with cleanness of teeth and all your towns with lack of bread, yet you did not return to Me,” declares the LORD.
14422	17	4	7	4	7	“I also withheld the rain from you when the harvest was three months away. I sent rain on one city but withheld it from another. One field received rain; another without rain withered.
14423	17	4	8	4	8	People staggered from city to city for water to drink, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me,” declares the LORD.
14424	17	4	9	4	9	“I struck you with blight and mildew in your growing gardens and vineyards; the locust devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you did not return to Me,” declares the LORD.
14425	17	4	10	4	10	“I sent plagues among you like those of Egypt; I killed your young men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp, yet you did not return to Me,” declares the LORD.
14426	17	4	11	4	11	“Some of you I overthrew as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze, yet you did not return to Me,” declares the LORD.
14427	17	4	12	4	12	“Therefore, that is what I will do to you, O Israel, and since I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel!
14428	17	4	13	4	13	For behold, He who forms the mountains, who creates the wind and reveals His thoughts to man, who turns the dawn to darkness and strides on the heights of the earth—the LORD, the God of Hosts, is His name.”
14429	17	5	1	5	1	Hear this word, O house of Israel, this lamentation I take up against you:
14430	17	5	2	5	2	“Fallen is Virgin Israel, never to rise again. She lies abandoned on her land, with no one to raise her up.”
14431	17	5	3	5	3	This is what the Lord GOD says: “The city that marches out a thousand strong will only see a hundred return, and the one that marches out a hundred strong will have but ten left in the house of Israel.”
14432	17	5	4	5	4	For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel: “Seek Me and live!
14433	17	5	5	5	5	Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal; do not journey to Beersheba, for Gilgal will surely go into exile, and Bethel will come to nothing.
14434	17	5	6	5	6	Seek the LORD and live, or He will sweep like fire through the house of Joseph; it will devour everything, with no one at Bethel to extinguish it.
14435	17	5	7	5	7	There are those who turn justice into wormwood and cast righteousness to the ground.
14436	17	5	8	5	8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion, who turns darkness into dawn and darkens day into night, who summons the waters of the sea and pours them over the face of the earth—the LORD is His name—
14437	17	5	9	5	9	He flashes destruction on the strong, so that fury comes upon the stronghold.
14438	17	5	10	5	10	There are those who hate the one who reproves in the gate and despise him who speaks with integrity.
14439	17	5	11	5	11	Therefore, because you trample on the poor and exact from him a tax of grain, you will never live in the stone houses you have built; you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted.
14440	17	5	12	5	12	For I know that your transgressions are many and your sins are numerous. You oppress the righteous, taking bribes and depriving the poor of justice at the gates.
14441	17	5	13	5	13	Therefore, the prudent keep silent in such times, for the days are evil.
14442	17	5	14	5	14	Seek good, not evil, so that you may live. And the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be with you, as you have claimed.
14443	17	5	15	5	15	Hate evil and love good; establish justice in the gate. Perhaps the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”
14444	17	5	16	5	16	Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says: “There will be wailing in all the public squares and cries of ‘Alas! Alas!’ in all the streets. The farmer will be summoned to mourn, and the mourners to wail.
14445	17	5	17	5	17	There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst,” says the LORD.
14446	17	5	18	5	18	Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD! What will the Day of the LORD be for you? It will be darkness and not light.
14447	17	5	19	5	19	It will be like a man who flees from a lion, only to encounter a bear, or who enters his house and rests his hand against the wall, only to be bitten by a snake.
14448	17	5	20	5	20	Will not the Day of the LORD be darkness and not light, even gloom with no brightness in it?
14449	17	5	21	5	21	“I hate, I despise your feasts! I cannot stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.
14450	17	5	22	5	22	Even though you offer Me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; for your peace offerings of fattened cattle I will have no regard.
14451	17	5	23	5	23	Take away from Me the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
14452	17	5	24	5	24	But let justice roll on like a river, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
14453	17	5	25	5	25	Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
14454	17	5	26	5	26	You have taken along Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan your star god, the idols you made for yourselves.
14455	17	5	27	5	27	Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is the God of Hosts.
14456	17	6	1	6	1	Woe to those at ease in Zion and those secure on Mount Samaria, the distinguished ones of the foremost nation, to whom the house of Israel comes.
14457	17	6	2	6	2	Cross over to Calneh and see; go from there to the great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Is their territory larger than yours?
14458	17	6	3	6	3	You dismiss the day of calamity and bring near a reign of violence.
14459	17	6	4	6	4	You lie on beds inlaid with ivory, and lounge upon your couches. You dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall.
14460	17	6	5	6	5	You improvise songs on the harp like David and invent your own musical instruments.
14461	17	6	6	6	6	You drink wine by the bowlful and anoint yourselves with the finest oils, but you fail to grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
14462	17	6	7	6	7	Therefore, you will now go into exile as the first of the captives, and your feasting and lounging will come to an end.
14463	17	6	8	6	8	The Lord GOD has sworn by Himself—the LORD, the God of Hosts, has declared: “I abhor Jacob’s pride and detest his citadels, so I will deliver up the city and everything in it.”
14464	17	6	9	6	9	And if there are ten men left in one house, they too will die.
14465	17	6	10	6	10	And when the relative who is to burn the bodies picks them up to remove them from the house, he will call to one inside, “Is anyone else with you?” “None,” that person will answer. “Silence,” the relative will retort, “for the name of the LORD must not be invoked.”
14466	17	6	11	6	11	For the LORD gives a command: “The great house will be smashed to pieces, and the small house to rubble.”
14467	17	6	12	6	12	“Do horses gallop on the cliffs? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood—
14468	17	6	13	6	13	you who rejoice in Lo-debar and say, ‘Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?’
14469	17	6	14	6	14	For behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD, the God of Hosts, “and they will oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of the Arabah.”
14470	17	7	1	7	1	This is what the Lord GOD showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts just after the king’s harvest, as the late spring crop was coming up.
14471	17	7	2	7	2	And when the locusts had eaten every green plant in the land, I said, “Lord GOD, please forgive! How will Jacob survive, since he is so small?”
14472	17	7	3	7	3	So the LORD relented from this plan. “It will not happen,” He said.
14473	17	7	4	7	4	This is what the Lord GOD showed me: The Lord GOD was calling for judgment by fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the land.
14474	17	7	5	7	5	Then I said, “Lord GOD, please stop! How will Jacob survive, since he is so small?”
14475	17	7	6	7	6	So the LORD relented from this plan. “It will not happen either,” said the Lord GOD.
14476	17	7	7	7	7	This is what He showed me: Behold, the Lord was standing by a wall true to plumb, with a plumb line in His hand.
14477	17	7	8	7	8	“Amos, what do you see?” asked the LORD. “A plumb line,” I replied. “Behold,” said the Lord, “I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel; I will no longer spare them:
14478	17	7	9	7	9	The high places of Isaac will be deserted, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with My sword.”
14479	17	7	10	7	10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words,
14480	17	7	11	7	11	for this is what Amos has said: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile, away from her homeland.’”
14481	17	7	12	7	12	And Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, you seer! Flee to the land of Judah; earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.
14482	17	7	13	7	13	But never prophesy at Bethel again, because it is the sanctuary of the king and the temple of the kingdom.”
14483	17	7	14	7	14	“I was not a prophet,” Amos replied, “nor was I the son of a prophet; rather, I was a herdsman and a tender of sycamore-fig trees.
14484	17	7	15	7	15	But the LORD took me from following the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’
14485	17	7	16	7	16	Now, therefore, hear the word of the LORD. You say: ‘Do not prophesy against Israel; do not preach against the house of Isaac.’
14486	17	7	17	7	17	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be divided by a measuring line, and you yourself will die on pagan soil. And Israel will surely go into exile, away from her homeland.’”
14487	17	8	1	8	1	This is what the Lord GOD showed me: I saw a basket of summer fruit.
14488	17	8	2	8	2	“Amos, what do you see?” He asked. “A basket of summer fruit,” I replied. So the LORD said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel; I will no longer spare them.”
14489	17	8	3	8	3	“In that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “the songs of the temple will turn to wailing. Many will be the corpses, strewn in silence everywhere!”
14490	17	8	4	8	4	Hear this, you who trample the needy, who do away with the poor of the land,
14491	17	8	5	8	5	asking, “When will the New Moon be over, that we may sell grain? When will the Sabbath end, that we may market wheat? Let us reduce the ephah and increase the shekel; let us cheat with dishonest scales.
14492	17	8	6	8	6	Let us buy the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling even the chaff with the wheat!”
14493	17	8	7	8	7	The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob: “I will never forget any of their deeds.
14494	17	8	8	8	8	Will not the land quake for this, and all its dwellers mourn? All of it will swell like the Nile; it will surge and then subside like the Nile in Egypt.
14495	17	8	9	8	9	And in that day, declares the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the daytime.
14496	17	8	10	8	10	I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation. I will cause everyone to wear sackcloth and every head to be shaved. I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son, and its outcome like a bitter day.
14497	17	8	11	8	11	Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.
14498	17	8	12	8	12	People will stagger from sea to sea and roam from north to east, seeking the word of the LORD, but they will not find it.
14499	17	8	13	8	13	In that day the lovely young women—the young men as well—will faint from thirst.
14500	17	8	14	8	14	Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, ‘As surely as your god lives, O Dan,’ or, ‘As surely as the Way of Beersheba lives’—they will fall, never to rise again.”
14501	17	9	1	9	1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said: “Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake. Topple them on the heads of all the people, and I will kill the rest with the sword. None of those who flee will get away; none of the fugitives will escape.
14502	17	9	2	9	2	Though they dig down to Sheol, from there My hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, from there I will pull them down.
14503	17	9	3	9	3	Though they hide themselves atop Carmel, there I will track them and seize them; and though they hide from Me at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.
14504	17	9	4	9	4	Though they are driven by their enemies into captivity, there I will command the sword to slay them. I will fix My eyes upon them for harm and not for good.”
14505	17	9	5	9	5	The Lord GOD of Hosts, He who touches the earth and it melts, and all its dwellers mourn—all the land rises like the Nile, then sinks like the river of Egypt—
14506	17	9	6	9	6	He builds His upper rooms in the heavens and founds His vault upon the earth. He summons the waters of the sea and pours them over the face of the earth. The LORD is His name.
14507	17	9	7	9	7	“Are you not like the Cushites to Me, O children of Israel?” declares the LORD. “Did I not bring Israel up from the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Arameans from Kir?
14508	17	9	8	9	8	Surely the eyes of the Lord GOD are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth. Yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” declares the LORD.
14509	17	9	9	9	9	“For surely I will give the command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations as grain is sifted in a sieve; but not a pebble will reach the ground.
14510	17	9	10	9	10	All the sinners among My people will die by the sword—all those who say, ‘Disaster will never draw near or confront us.’”
14511	17	9	11	9	11	“In that day I will restore the fallen tent of David. I will repair its gaps, restore its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old,
14512	17	9	12	9	12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear My name,” declares the LORD, who will do this.
14513	17	9	13	9	13	“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when the plowman will overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes, the sower of seed. The mountains will drip with sweet wine, with which all the hills will flow.
14514	17	9	14	9	14	I will restore My people Israel from captivity; they will rebuild and inhabit the ruined cities. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit.
14515	17	9	15	9	15	I will firmly plant them in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land that I have given them,” says the LORD your God.
14516	18	1	1	1	1	This is the vision of Obadiah: This is what the Lord GOD says about Edom—We have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent among the nations to say, “Rise up, and let us go to battle against her!”—
14517	18	1	2	1	2	“Behold, I will make you small among the nations; you will be deeply despised.
14518	18	1	3	1	3	The pride of your heart has deceived you, O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks whose habitation is the heights, who say in your heart, ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’
14519	18	1	4	1	4	Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, even from there I will bring you down,” declares the LORD.
14520	18	1	5	1	5	“If thieves came to you, if robbers by night—oh, how you will be ruined—would they not steal only what they wanted? If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings?
14521	18	1	6	1	6	But how Esau will be pillaged, his hidden treasures sought out!
14522	18	1	7	1	7	All the men allied with you will drive you to the border; the men at peace with you will deceive and overpower you. Those who eat your bread will set a trap for you without your awareness of it.
14523	18	1	8	1	8	In that day, declares the LORD, will I not destroy the wise men of Edom and the men of understanding in the mountains of Esau?
14524	18	1	9	1	9	Then your mighty men, O Teman, will be terrified, so that everyone in the mountains of Esau will be cut down in the slaughter.
14525	18	1	10	1	10	Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame and cut off forever.
14526	18	1	11	1	11	On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gate and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were just like one of them.
14527	18	1	12	1	12	But you should not gloat in that day, your brother’s day of misfortune, nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction, nor boast proudly in the day of their distress.
14528	18	1	13	1	13	You should not enter the gate of My people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over their affliction in the day of their disaster, nor loot their wealth in the day of their disaster.
14529	18	1	14	1	14	Nor should you stand at the crossroads to cut off their fugitives, nor deliver up their survivors in the day of their distress.
14530	18	1	15	1	15	For the Day of the LORD is near for all the nations. As you have done, it will be done to you; your recompense will return upon your own head.
14531	18	1	16	1	16	For as you drank on My holy mountain, so all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and gulp it down; they will be as if they had never existed.
14532	18	1	17	1	17	But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance, and it will be holy, and the house of Jacob will reclaim their possession.
14533	18	1	18	1	18	Then the house of Jacob will be a blazing fire, and the house of Joseph a burning flame; but the house of Esau will be stubble—Jacob will set it ablaze and consume it. Therefore no survivor will remain from the house of Esau.” For the LORD has spoken.
14534	18	1	19	1	19	Those from the Negev will possess the mountains of Esau; those from the foothills will possess the land of the Philistines. They will occupy the fields of Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
14535	18	1	20	1	20	And the exiles of this host of the Israelites will possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath; and the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negev.
14536	18	1	21	1	21	The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion to rule over the mountains of Esau. And the kingdom will belong to the LORD.
14537	19	1	1	1	1	Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying,
14538	19	1	2	1	2	“Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before Me.”
14539	19	1	3	1	3	Jonah, however, got up to flee to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to sail for Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD.
14540	19	1	4	1	4	Then the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship was in danger of breaking apart.
14541	19	1	5	1	5	The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
14542	19	1	6	1	6	The captain approached him and said, “How can you sleep? Get up and call upon your God. Perhaps this God will consider us, so that we may not perish.”
14543	19	1	7	1	7	“Come!” said the sailors to one another. “Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity that is upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
14544	19	1	8	1	8	“Tell us now,” they demanded, “who is to blame for this calamity that is upon us? What is your occupation, and where have you come from? What is your country, and who are your people?”
14545	19	1	9	1	9	“I am a Hebrew,” replied Jonah. “I worship the LORD, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.”
14546	19	1	10	1	10	Then the men were even more afraid and said to him, “What have you done?” The men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
14547	19	1	11	1	11	Now the sea was growing worse and worse, so they said to Jonah, “What must we do to you to calm this sea for us?”
14548	19	1	12	1	12	“Pick me up,” he answered, “and cast me into the sea, so it may quiet down for you. For I know that I am to blame for this violent storm that has come upon you.”
14549	19	1	13	1	13	Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea was raging against them more and more.
14550	19	1	14	1	14	So they cried out to the LORD: “Please, O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life! Do not charge us with innocent blood! For You, O LORD, have done as You pleased.”
14551	19	1	15	1	15	At this, they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the raging sea grew calm.
14552	19	1	16	1	16	Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to Him.
14553	19	2	1	1	17	Now the LORD had appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of the fish.
14554	19	2	2	2	1	From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,
14555	19	2	3	2	2	saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.
14556	19	2	4	2	3	For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me.
14557	19	2	5	2	4	At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’
14558	19	2	6	2	5	The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.
14559	19	2	7	2	6	To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!
14560	19	2	8	2	7	As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.
14561	19	2	9	2	8	Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.
14562	19	2	10	2	9	But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!”
14563	19	2	11	2	10	And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
14564	19	3	1	3	1	Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time:
14565	19	3	2	3	2	“Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message that I give you.”
14566	19	3	3	3	3	This time Jonah got up and went to Nineveh, in accordance with the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three-day journey to cross.
14567	19	3	4	3	4	On the first day of his walk, Jonah set out into the city and proclaimed, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned!”
14568	19	3	5	3	5	And the Ninevites believed God. They proclaimed a fast and dressed in sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least.
14569	19	3	6	3	6	When word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
14570	19	3	7	3	7	Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let no man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything at all. They must not eat or drink.
14571	19	3	8	3	8	Furthermore, let both man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and have everyone call out earnestly to God. Let each one turn from his evil ways and from the violence in his hands.
14572	19	3	9	3	9	Who knows? God may turn and relent; He may turn from His fierce anger, so that we will not perish.”
14573	19	3	10	3	10	When God saw their actions—that they had turned from their evil ways—He relented from the disaster He had threatened to bring upon them.
14574	19	4	1	4	1	Jonah, however, was greatly displeased, and he became angry.
14575	19	4	2	4	2	So he prayed to the LORD, saying, “O LORD, is this not what I said while I was still in my own country? This is why I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish. I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion—One who relents from sending disaster.
14576	19	4	3	4	3	And now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”
14577	19	4	4	4	4	But the LORD replied, “Have you any right to be angry?”
14578	19	4	5	4	5	Then Jonah left the city and sat down east of it, where he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city.
14579	19	4	6	4	6	So the LORD God appointed a vine, and it grew up to provide shade over Jonah’s head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant.
14580	19	4	7	4	7	When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant so that it withered.
14581	19	4	8	4	8	As the sun was rising, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint and wished to die, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.”
14582	19	4	9	4	9	Then God asked Jonah, “Have you any right to be angry about the plant?” “I do,” he replied. “I am angry enough to die!”
14583	19	4	10	4	10	But the LORD said, “You cared about the plant, which you neither tended nor made grow. It sprang up in a night and perished in a night.
14584	19	4	11	4	11	So should I not care about the great city of Nineveh, which has more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well?”
14585	20	1	1	1	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:
14586	20	1	2	1	2	Hear, O peoples, all of you; listen, O earth, and everyone in it! May the Lord GOD bear witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.
14587	20	1	3	1	3	For behold, the LORD comes forth from His dwelling place; He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.
14588	20	1	4	1	4	The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.
14589	20	1	5	1	5	All this is for the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?
14590	20	1	6	1	6	Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble in the open field, a planting area for a vineyard. I will pour her stones into the valley and expose her foundations.
14591	20	1	7	1	7	All her carved images will be smashed to pieces; all her wages will be burned in the fire, and I will destroy all her idols. Since she collected the wages of a prostitute, they will be used again on a prostitute.
14592	20	1	8	1	8	Because of this I will lament and wail; I will walk barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and mourn like an ostrich.
14593	20	1	9	1	9	For her wound is incurable; it has reached even Judah; it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself.
14594	20	1	10	1	10	Do not tell it in Gath; do not weep at all. Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah.
14595	20	1	11	1	11	Depart in shameful nakedness, O dwellers of Shaphir. The dwellers of Zaanan will not come out. Beth-ezel is in mourning; its support is taken from you.
14596	20	1	12	1	12	For the dwellers of Maroth pined for good, but calamity came down from the LORD, even to the gate of Jerusalem.
14597	20	1	13	1	13	Harness your chariot horses, O dweller of Lachish. You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
14598	20	1	14	1	14	Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath; the houses of Achzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.
14599	20	1	15	1	15	I will again bring a conqueror against you, O dweller of Mareshah. The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
14600	20	1	16	1	16	Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair in mourning for your precious children; make yourselves as bald as an eagle, for they will go from you into exile.
14601	20	2	1	2	1	Woe to those who devise iniquity and plot evil on their beds! At morning’s light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.
14602	20	2	2	2	2	They covet fields and seize them; they take away houses. They deprive a man of his home, a fellow man of his inheritance.
14603	20	2	3	2	3	Therefore this is what the LORD says: “I am planning against this nation a disaster from which you cannot free your necks. Then you will not walk so proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.
14604	20	2	4	2	4	In that day they will take up a proverb against you and taunt you with this bitter lamentation: ‘We are utterly ruined; He has changed the portion of my people! How He has removed it from me; He has allotted our fields to traitors!’”
14605	20	2	5	2	5	Therefore, you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.
14606	20	2	6	2	6	“Do not preach,” they preach. “Do not preach these things; disgrace will not overtake us.”
14607	20	2	7	2	7	Should it be said, O house of Jacob, “Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these the things He does?” Do not My words bring good to him who walks uprightly?
14608	20	2	8	2	8	But of late My people have risen up like an enemy: You strip off the splendid robe from unsuspecting passersby like men returning from battle.
14609	20	2	9	2	9	You drive the women of My people from their pleasant homes. You take away My blessing from their children forever.
14610	20	2	10	2	10	Arise and depart, for this is not your place of rest, because its defilement brings destruction—a grievous destruction!
14611	20	2	11	2	11	If a man of wind were to come and say falsely, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” he would be just the preacher for this people!
14612	20	2	12	2	12	I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the midst of its pasture—a noisy throng.
14613	20	2	13	2	13	One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate, and go out by it. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader.
14614	20	3	1	3	1	Then I said: “Hear now, O leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel. Should you not know justice?
14615	20	3	2	3	2	You hate good and love evil. You tear the skin from my people and strip the flesh from their bones.
14616	20	3	3	3	3	You eat the flesh of my people after stripping off their skin and breaking their bones. You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot, like meat in a cauldron.”
14617	20	3	4	3	4	Then they will cry out to the LORD, but He will not answer them. At that time He will hide His face from them because of the evil they have done.
14618	20	3	5	3	5	This is what the LORD says: “As for the prophets who lead My people astray, who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth, but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths:
14619	20	3	6	3	6	Therefore night will come over you without visions, and darkness without divination. The sun will set on these prophets, and the daylight will turn black over them.
14620	20	3	7	3	7	Then the seers will be ashamed and the diviners will be disgraced. They will all cover their mouths because there is no answer from God.”
14621	20	3	8	3	8	As for me, however, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD, with justice and courage, to declare to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin.
14622	20	3	9	3	9	Now hear this, O leaders of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel, who despise justice and pervert all that is right,
14623	20	3	10	3	10	who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with iniquity.
14624	20	3	11	3	11	Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets practice divination for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD, saying, “Is not the LORD among us? No disaster can come upon us.”
14625	20	3	12	3	12	Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, and the temple mount a wooded ridge.
14626	20	4	1	4	1	In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD will be established as the chief of the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and the peoples will stream to it.
14627	20	4	2	4	2	And many nations will come and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us His ways, so that we may walk in His paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
14628	20	4	3	4	3	Then He will judge between many peoples and arbitrate for strong nations far and wide. Then they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation, nor will they train anymore for war.
14629	20	4	4	4	4	And each man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree, with no one to frighten him. For the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has spoken.
14630	20	4	5	4	5	Though each of the peoples may walk in the name of his god, yet we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.
14631	20	4	6	4	6	“On that day,” declares the LORD, “I will gather the lame; I will assemble the outcast, even those whom I have afflicted.
14632	20	4	7	4	7	And I will make the lame into a remnant, and the outcast into a strong nation. Then the LORD will rule over them in Mount Zion from that day and forever.
14633	20	4	8	4	8	And you, O watchtower of the flock, O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion—the former dominion will be restored to you; sovereignty will come to the Daughter of Jerusalem.”
14634	20	4	9	4	9	Why do you now cry aloud? Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?
14635	20	4	10	4	10	Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor. For now you will leave the city and camp in the open fields. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued; there the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies!
14636	20	4	11	4	11	But now many nations have assembled against you, saying, “Let her be defiled, and let us feast our eyes on Zion.”
14637	20	4	12	4	12	But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD or understand His plan, for He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.
14638	20	4	13	4	13	Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion, for I will give you horns of iron and hooves of bronze to break to pieces many peoples. Then you will devote their gain to the LORD, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
14639	20	4	14	5	1	Now, O daughter of troops, mobilize your troops; for a siege is laid against us! With a rod they will strike the cheek of the judge of Israel.
14640	20	5	1	5	2	But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come forth for Me One to be ruler over Israel, whose origins are of old, from the days of eternity.
14641	20	5	2	5	3	Therefore Israel will be abandoned until she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of His brothers will return to the children of Israel.
14642	20	5	3	5	4	He will stand and shepherd His flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majestic name of the LORD His God. And they will dwell securely, for then His greatness will extend to the ends of the earth.
14643	20	5	4	5	5	And He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land and tramples our citadels. We will raise against it seven shepherds, even eight leaders of men.
14644	20	5	5	5	6	And they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with the blade drawn. So He will deliver us when Assyria invades our land and marches into our borders.
14645	20	5	6	5	7	Then the remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which do not wait for man or linger for mankind.
14646	20	5	7	5	8	Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, which tramples and tears as it passes through, with no one to rescue them.
14647	20	5	8	5	9	Your hand will be lifted over your foes, and all your enemies will be cut off.
14648	20	5	9	5	10	“In that day,” declares the LORD, “I will remove your horses from among you and wreck your chariots.
14649	20	5	10	5	11	I will remove the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds.
14650	20	5	11	5	12	I will cut the sorceries from your hand, and you will have no fortune-tellers.
14651	20	5	12	5	13	I will also cut off the carved images and sacred pillars from among you, so that you will no longer bow down to the work of your own hands.
14652	20	5	13	5	14	I will root out the Asherah poles from your midst and demolish your cities.
14653	20	5	14	5	15	I will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed Me.”
14654	20	6	1	6	1	Hear now what the LORD says: “Arise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
14655	20	6	2	6	2	Hear, O mountains, the LORD’s indictment, you enduring foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against His people, and He will argue it against Israel:
14656	20	6	3	6	3	‘My people, what have I done to you? Testify against Me how I have wearied you!
14657	20	6	4	6	4	For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery. I sent Moses before you, as well as Aaron and Miriam.
14658	20	6	5	6	5	My people, remember what Balak king of Moab counseled and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may acknowledge the righteousness of the LORD.’”
14659	20	6	6	6	6	With what shall I come before the LORD when I bow before the God on high? Should I come to Him with burnt offerings, with year-old calves?
14660	20	6	7	6	7	Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I present my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
14661	20	6	8	6	8	He has shown you, O mankind, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
14662	20	6	9	6	9	The voice of the LORD calls out to the city (and it is sound wisdom to fear Your name): “Heed the rod and the One who ordained it.
14663	20	6	10	6	10	Can I forget any longer, O house of the wicked, the treasures of wickedness and the short ephah, which is accursed?
14664	20	6	11	6	11	Can I excuse dishonest scales or bags of false weights?
14665	20	6	12	6	12	For the wealthy of the city are full of violence, and its residents speak lies; their tongues are deceitful in their mouths.
14666	20	6	13	6	13	Therefore I am striking you severely, to ruin you because of your sins.
14667	20	6	14	6	14	You will eat but not be satisfied, and your hunger will remain with you. What you acquire, you will not preserve; and what you save, I will give to the sword.
14668	20	6	15	6	15	You will sow but not reap; you will press olives but not anoint yourselves with oil; you will tread grapes but not drink the wine.
14669	20	6	16	6	16	You have kept the statutes of Omri and all the practices of Ahab’s house; you have followed their counsel. Therefore I will make you a desolation, and your inhabitants an object of contempt; you will bear the scorn of the nations.”
14670	20	7	1	7	1	Woe is me! For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave.
14671	20	7	2	7	2	The godly man has perished from the earth; there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; they hunt each other with a net.
14672	20	7	3	7	3	Both hands are skilled at evil; the prince and the judge demand a bribe. When the powerful utters his evil desire, they all conspire together.
14673	20	7	4	7	4	The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is sharper than a hedge of thorns. The day for your watchmen has come, the day of your visitation. Now is the time of their confusion.
14674	20	7	5	7	5	Do not rely on a friend; do not trust in a companion. Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms.
14675	20	7	6	7	6	For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the members of his own household.
14676	20	7	7	7	7	But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
14677	20	7	8	7	8	Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
14678	20	7	9	7	9	Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the rage of the LORD, until He argues my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His righteousness.
14679	20	7	10	7	10	Then my enemy will see and will be covered with shame—she who said to me, “Where is the LORD your God?” My eyes will see her; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets.
14680	20	7	11	7	11	The day for rebuilding your walls will come—the day for extending your boundary.
14681	20	7	12	7	12	On that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates, from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
14682	20	7	13	7	13	Then the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the fruit of their deeds.
14683	20	7	14	7	14	Shepherd with Your staff Your people, the flock of Your inheritance. They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
14684	20	7	15	7	15	As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show My wonders.
14685	20	7	16	7	16	Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their might. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf.
14686	20	7	17	7	17	They will lick the dust like a snake, like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will crawl from their holes in the presence of the LORD our God; they will tremble in fear of You.
14687	20	7	18	7	18	Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance—who does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in loving devotion?
14688	20	7	19	7	19	He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast out all our sins into the depths of the sea.
14689	20	7	20	7	20	You will show faithfulness to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from the days of old.
14690	21	1	1	1	1	This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
14691	21	1	2	1	2	The LORD is a jealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and full of wrath. The LORD takes vengeance on His foes and reserves wrath for His enemies.
14692	21	1	3	1	3	The LORD is slow to anger and great in power; the LORD will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. His path is in the whirlwind and storm, and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
14693	21	1	4	1	4	He rebukes the sea and dries it up; He makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.
14694	21	1	5	1	5	The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles at His presence—the world and all its dwellers.
14695	21	1	6	1	6	Who can withstand His indignation? Who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; even rocks are shattered before Him.
14696	21	1	7	1	7	The LORD is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; He cares for those who trust in Him.
14697	21	1	8	1	8	But with an overwhelming flood He will make an end of Nineveh and pursue His enemies into darkness.
14698	21	1	9	1	9	Whatever you plot against the LORD, He will bring to an end. Affliction will not rise up a second time.
14699	21	1	10	1	10	For they will be entangled as with thorns and consumed like the drink of a drunkard—like stubble that is fully dry.
14700	21	1	11	1	11	From you, O Nineveh, comes forth a plotter of evil against the LORD, a counselor of wickedness.
14701	21	1	12	1	12	This is what the LORD says: “Though they are allied and numerous, yet they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, O Judah, I will afflict you no longer.
14702	21	1	13	1	13	For I will now break their yoke from your neck and tear away your shackles.”
14703	21	1	14	1	14	The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh: “There will be no descendants to carry on your name. I will cut off the carved image and cast idol from the house of your gods; I will prepare your grave, for you are contemptible.”
14704	21	2	1	1	15	Look to the mountains—the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked will never again march through you; they will be utterly cut off.
14705	21	2	2	2	1	One who scatters advances against you, O Nineveh. Guard the fortress! Watch the road! Brace yourselves! Summon all your strength!
14706	21	2	3	2	2	For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and ruined the branches of their vine.
14707	21	2	4	2	3	The shields of his mighty men are red; the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariots flash like fire on the day they are prepared, and the spears of cypress have been brandished.
14708	21	2	5	2	4	The chariots dash through the streets; they rush around the plazas, appearing like torches, darting about like lightning.
14709	21	2	6	2	5	He summons his nobles; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.
14710	21	2	7	2	6	The river gates are thrown open, and the palace collapses.
14711	21	2	8	2	7	It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away; her maidservants moan like doves, and beat upon their breasts.
14712	21	2	9	2	8	Nineveh has been like a pool of water throughout her days, but now it is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.
14713	21	2	10	2	9	“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.
14714	21	2	11	2	10	She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and laid waste! Hearts melt, knees knock, bodies tremble, and every face grows pale!
14715	21	2	12	2	11	Where is the lions’ lair or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs, with nothing to frighten them away?
14716	21	2	13	2	12	The lion mauled enough for its cubs and strangled prey for the lioness. It filled its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey.
14717	21	2	14	2	13	“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will send your chariots up in smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”
14718	21	3	1	3	1	Woe to the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without prey.
14719	21	3	2	3	2	The crack of the whip, the rumble of the wheel, galloping horse and bounding chariot!
14720	21	3	3	3	3	Charging horseman, flashing sword, shining spear; heaps of slain, mounds of corpses, dead bodies without end—they stumble over their dead—
14721	21	3	4	3	4	because of the many harlotries of the harlot, the seductive mistress of sorcery, who betrays nations by her prostitution and clans by her witchcraft.
14722	21	3	5	3	5	“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show your nakedness to the nations and your shame to the kingdoms.
14723	21	3	6	3	6	I will pelt you with filth and treat you with contempt; I will make a spectacle of you.
14724	21	3	7	3	7	Then all who see you will recoil from you and say, ‘Nineveh is devastated; who will grieve for her?’ Where can I find comforters for you?”
14725	21	3	8	3	8	Are you better than Thebes, stationed by the Nile with water around her, whose rampart was the sea, whose wall was the water?
14726	21	3	9	3	9	Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength; Put and Libya were her allies.
14727	21	3	10	3	10	Yet she became an exile; she went into captivity. Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her dignitaries, and all her nobles were bound in chains.
14728	21	3	11	3	11	You too will become drunk; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy.
14729	21	3	12	3	12	All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs; when shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!
14730	21	3	13	3	13	Look at your troops—they are like your women! The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies; fire consumes their bars.
14731	21	3	14	3	14	Draw your water for the siege; strengthen your fortresses. Work the clay and tread the mortar; repair the brick kiln!
14732	21	3	15	3	15	There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down and consume you like a young locust. Make yourself many like the young locust; make yourself many like the swarming locust!
14733	21	3	16	3	16	You have multiplied your merchants more than the stars of the sky. The young locust strips the land and flies away.
14734	21	3	17	3	17	Your guards are like the swarming locust, and your scribes like clouds of locusts that settle on the walls on a cold day. When the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where.
14735	21	3	18	3	18	O king of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your officers sleep. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.
14736	21	3	19	3	19	There is no healing for your injury; your wound is severe. All who hear the news of you applaud your downfall, for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?
14737	22	1	1	1	1	This is the burden that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision:
14738	22	1	2	1	2	How long, O LORD, must I call for help but You do not hear, or cry out to You, “Violence!” but You do not save?
14739	22	1	3	1	3	Why do You make me see iniquity? Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict abounds.
14740	22	1	4	1	4	Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked hem in the righteous, so that justice is perverted.
14741	22	1	5	1	5	Look at the nations and observe—be utterly astounded! For I am doing a work in your days that you would never believe even if someone told you.
14742	22	1	6	1	6	For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans—that ruthless and impetuous nation which marches through the breadth of the earth to seize dwellings not their own.
14743	22	1	7	1	7	They are dreaded and feared; from themselves they derive justice and sovereignty.
14744	22	1	8	1	8	Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead, and their cavalry comes from afar. They fly like a vulture, swooping down to devour.
14745	22	1	9	1	9	All of them come bent on violence; their hordes advance like the east wind; they gather prisoners like sand.
14746	22	1	10	1	10	They scoff at kings and make rulers an object of scorn. They laugh at every fortress and build up siege ramps to seize it.
14747	22	1	11	1	11	Then they sweep by like the wind and pass on through. They are guilty; their own strength is their god.
14748	22	1	12	1	12	Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O LORD, You have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, You have established them for correction.
14749	22	1	13	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to look upon evil, and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate the faithless? Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
14750	22	1	14	1	14	You have made men like the fish of the sea, like creeping things that have no ruler.
14751	22	1	15	1	15	The foe pulls all of them up with a hook; he catches them in his dragnet, and gathers them in his fishing net; so he rejoices gladly.
14752	22	1	16	1	16	Therefore he sacrifices to his dragnet and burns incense to his fishing net, for by these things his portion is sumptuous and his food is rich.
14753	22	1	17	1	17	Will he, therefore, empty his net and continue to slay nations without mercy?
14754	22	2	1	2	1	I will stand at my guard post and station myself on the ramparts. I will watch to see what He will say to me, and how I should answer when corrected.
14755	22	2	2	2	2	Then the LORD answered me: “Write down this vision and clearly inscribe it on tablets, so that a herald may run with it.
14756	22	2	3	2	3	For the vision awaits an appointed time; it testifies of the end and does not lie. Though it lingers, wait for it, since it will surely come and not delay.
14757	22	2	4	2	4	Look at the proud one; his soul is not upright—but the righteous will live by faith—
14758	22	2	5	2	5	and wealth indeed betrays him. He is an arrogant man never at rest. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, and like Death, he is never satisfied. He gathers all the nations to himself and collects all the peoples as his own.
14759	22	2	6	2	6	Will not all of these take up a taunt against him, speaking with mockery and derision: ‘Woe to him who amasses what is not his and makes himself rich with many loans! How long will this go on?’
14760	22	2	7	2	7	Will not your creditors suddenly arise and those who disturb you awaken? Then you will become their prey.
14761	22	2	8	2	8	Because you have plundered many nations, the remnant of the people will plunder you—because of your bloodshed against man and your violence against the land, the city, and all their dwellers.
14762	22	2	9	2	9	Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain, to place his nest on high and escape the hand of disaster!
14763	22	2	10	2	10	You have plotted shame for your house by cutting off many peoples and forfeiting your life.
14764	22	2	11	2	11	For the stones will cry out from the wall, and the rafters will echo it from the woodwork.
14765	22	2	12	2	12	Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by iniquity!
14766	22	2	13	2	13	Is it not indeed from the LORD of Hosts that the labor of the people only feeds the fire, and the nations weary themselves in vain?
14767	22	2	14	2	14	For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
14768	22	2	15	2	15	Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors, pouring it from the wineskin until they are drunk, in order to gaze at their nakedness!
14769	22	2	16	2	16	You will be filled with shame instead of glory. You too must drink and expose your uncircumcision! The cup in the LORD’s right hand will come around to you, and utter disgrace will cover your glory.
14770	22	2	17	2	17	For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of animals will terrify you, because of your bloodshed against men and your violence against the land, the city, and all their dwellers.
14771	22	2	18	2	18	What use is an idol, that a craftsman should carve it—or an image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in his own creation; he makes idols that cannot speak.
14772	22	2	19	2	19	Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Awake!’ or to silent stone, ‘Arise!’ Can it give guidance? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, yet there is no breath in it at all.
14773	22	2	20	2	20	But the LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.”
14774	22	3	1	3	1	This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth:
14775	22	3	2	3	2	O LORD, I have heard the report of You; I stand in awe, O LORD, of Your deeds. Revive them in these years; make them known in these years. In Your wrath, remember mercy!
14776	22	3	3	3	3	God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah His glory covered the heavens, and His praise filled the earth.
14777	22	3	4	3	4	His radiance was like the sunlight; rays flashed from His hand, where His power is hidden.
14778	22	3	5	3	5	Plague went before Him, and fever followed in His steps.
14779	22	3	6	3	6	He stood and measured the earth; He looked and startled the nations; the ancient mountains crumbled; the perpetual hills collapsed. His ways are everlasting.
14780	22	3	7	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in distress; the curtains of Midian were trembling.
14781	22	3	8	3	8	Were You angry at the rivers, O LORD? Was Your wrath against the streams? Did You rage against the sea when You rode on Your horses, on Your chariots of salvation?
14782	22	3	9	3	9	You brandished Your bow; You called for many arrows. Selah You split the earth with rivers.
14783	22	3	10	3	10	The mountains saw You and quaked; torrents of water swept by. The deep roared with its voice and lifted its hands on high.
14784	22	3	11	3	11	Sun and moon stood still in their places at the flash of Your flying arrows, at the brightness of Your shining spear.
14785	22	3	12	3	12	You marched across the earth with fury; You threshed the nations in wrath.
14786	22	3	13	3	13	You went forth for the salvation of Your people, to save Your anointed. You crushed the head of the house of the wicked and stripped him from head to toe. Selah
14787	22	3	14	3	14	With his own spear You pierced his head, when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, gloating as though ready to secretly devour the weak.
14788	22	3	15	3	15	You trampled the sea with Your horses, churning the great waters.
14789	22	3	16	3	16	I heard and trembled within; my lips quivered at the sound. Decay entered my bones; I trembled where I stood. Yet I must wait patiently for the day of distress to come upon the people who invade us.
14790	22	3	17	3	17	Though the fig tree does not bud and no fruit is on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though the sheep are cut off from the fold and no cattle are in the stalls,
14791	22	3	18	3	18	yet I will exult in the LORD; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation!
14792	22	3	19	3	19	GOD the Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer; He makes me walk upon the heights! For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments.
14793	23	1	1	1	1	This is the word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
14794	23	1	2	1	2	“I will completely sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.
14795	23	1	3	1	3	“I will sweep away man and beast; I will sweep away the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and the idols with their wicked worshipers. I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.
14796	23	1	4	1	4	“I will stretch out My hand against Judah and against all who dwell in Jerusalem. I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal, the names of the idolatrous and pagan priests—
14797	23	1	5	1	5	those who bow on the rooftops to worship the host of heaven, those who bow down and swear by the LORD but also swear by Milcom,
14798	23	1	6	1	6	and those who turn back from following the LORD, neither seeking the LORD nor inquiring of Him.”
14799	23	1	7	1	7	Be silent in the presence of the Lord GOD, for the Day of the LORD is near. Indeed, the LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests.
14800	23	1	8	1	8	“On the Day of the LORD’s sacrifice I will punish the princes, the king’s sons, and all who are dressed in foreign apparel.
14801	23	1	9	1	9	On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold, who fill the house of their master with violence and deceit.
14802	23	1	10	1	10	On that day,” declares the LORD, “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, a wail from the Second District, and a loud crashing from the hills.
14803	23	1	11	1	11	Wail, O dwellers of the Hollow, for all your merchants will be silenced; all who weigh out silver will be cut off.
14804	23	1	12	1	12	And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the men settled in complacency, who say to themselves, ‘The LORD will do nothing, either good or bad.’
14805	23	1	13	1	13	Their wealth will be plundered and their houses laid waste. They will build houses but not inhabit them, and plant vineyards but never drink their wine.
14806	23	1	14	1	14	The great Day of the LORD is near—near and coming quickly. Listen, the Day of the LORD! Then the cry of the mighty will be bitter.
14807	23	1	15	1	15	That day will be a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,
14808	23	1	16	1	16	a day of horn blast and battle cry against the fortified cities, and against the high corner towers.
14809	23	1	17	1	17	I will bring such distress on mankind that they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the LORD. Their blood will be poured out like dust and their flesh like dung.
14810	23	1	18	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them on the Day of the LORD’s wrath. The whole earth will be consumed by the fire of His jealousy.” For indeed, He will make a sudden end of all who dwell on the earth.
14811	23	2	1	2	1	Gather yourselves, gather together, O shameful nation,
14812	23	2	2	2	2	before the decree takes effect and the day passes like chaff, before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the Day of the LORD’s anger comes upon you.
14813	23	2	3	2	3	Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth who carry out His justice. Seek righteousness; seek humility. Perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the LORD’s anger.
14814	23	2	4	2	4	For Gaza will be abandoned, and Ashkelon left in ruins. Ashdod will be driven out at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
14815	23	2	5	2	5	Woe to the dwellers of the seacoast, O nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: “I will destroy you, and no one will be left.”
14816	23	2	6	2	6	So the seacoast will become a land of pastures, with wells for shepherds and folds for sheep.
14817	23	2	7	2	7	The coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah; there they will find pasture. They will lie down in the evening among the houses of Ashkelon, for the LORD their God will attend to them and restore their captives.
14818	23	2	8	2	8	“I have heard the reproach of Moab and the insults of the Ammonites, who have taunted My people and threatened their borders.
14819	23	2	9	2	9	Therefore, as surely as I live,” declares the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, “surely Moab will be like Sodom and the Ammonites like Gomorrah—a place of weeds and salt pits, a perpetual wasteland. The remnant of My people will plunder them; the remainder of My nation will dispossess them.”
14820	23	2	10	2	10	This they shall have in return for their pride, for taunting and mocking the people of the LORD of Hosts.
14821	23	2	11	2	11	The LORD will be terrifying to them when He starves all the gods of the earth. Then the nations of every shore will bow in worship to Him, each in its own place.
14822	23	2	12	2	12	“You too, O Cushites, will be slain by My sword.”
14823	23	2	13	2	13	And He will stretch out His hand against the north and destroy Assyria; He will make Nineveh a desolation, as dry as a desert.
14824	23	2	14	2	14	Herds will lie down in her midst, creatures of every kind. Both the desert owl and screech owl will roost atop her pillars. Their calls will sound from the window, but desolation will lie on the threshold, for He will expose the beams of cedar.
14825	23	2	15	2	15	This carefree city that dwells securely, that thinks to herself: “I am it, and there is none besides me,” what a ruin she has become, a resting place for beasts. Everyone who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist.
14826	23	3	1	3	1	Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled!
14827	23	3	2	3	2	She heeded no voice; she accepted no correction. She does not trust in the LORD; she has not drawn near to her God.
14828	23	3	3	3	3	Her princes are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, leaving nothing for the morning.
14829	23	3	4	3	4	Her prophets are reckless, faithless men. Her priests profane the sanctuary; they do violence to the law.
14830	23	3	5	3	5	The LORD within her is righteous; He does no wrong. He applies His justice morning by morning; He does not fail at dawn, yet the unjust knows no shame.
14831	23	3	6	3	6	“I have cut off the nations; their corner towers are destroyed. I have made their streets deserted with no one to pass through. Their cities are laid waste, with no man, no inhabitant.
14832	23	3	7	3	7	I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me and accept correction.’ Then her dwelling place would not be cut off despite all for which I punished her. But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds.
14833	23	3	8	3	8	Therefore wait for Me,” declares the LORD, “until the day I rise to testify. For My decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out upon them My indignation—all My burning anger. For all the earth will be consumed by the fire of My jealousy.
14834	23	3	9	3	9	For then I will restore pure lips to the peoples, that all may call upon the name of the LORD and serve Him shoulder to shoulder.
14835	23	3	10	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Cush My worshipers, My scattered people, will bring Me an offering.
14836	23	3	11	3	11	On that day you will not be put to shame for any of the deeds by which you have transgressed against Me. For then I will remove from among you those who rejoice in their pride, and you will never again be haughty on My holy mountain.
14837	23	3	12	3	12	But I will leave within you a meek and humble people, and they will trust in the name of the LORD.
14838	23	3	13	3	13	The remnant of Israel will no longer do wrong or speak lies, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. But they will feed and lie down, with no one to make them tremble.”
14839	23	3	14	3	14	Sing for joy, O Daughter of Zion; shout aloud, O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, O Daughter of Jerusalem!
14840	23	3	15	3	15	The LORD has taken away your punishment; He has turned back your enemy. Israel’s King, the LORD, is among you; no longer will you fear any harm.
14841	23	3	16	3	16	On that day they will say to Jerusalem: “Do not fear, O Zion; do not let your hands fall limp.
14842	23	3	17	3	17	The LORD your God is among you; He is mighty to save. He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will quiet you with His love; He will rejoice over you with singing.”
14843	23	3	18	3	18	“I will gather those among you who grieve over the appointed feasts, so that you will no longer suffer reproach.
14844	23	3	19	3	19	Behold, at that time, I will deal with all who afflict you. I will save the lame and gather the scattered; and I will appoint praise and fame for the disgraced throughout the earth.
14845	23	3	20	3	20	At that time I will bring you in; yes, at that time I will gather you. For I will give you fame and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your captives before your very eyes,” says the LORD.
14846	24	1	1	1	1	In the second year of the reign of Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, stating
14847	24	1	2	1	2	that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “These people say, ‘The time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.’”
14848	24	1	3	1	3	Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
14849	24	1	4	1	4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?”
14850	24	1	5	1	5	Now this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Consider carefully your ways.
14851	24	1	6	1	6	You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough. You drink but never have your fill. You put on clothes but never get warm. You earn wages to put into a bag pierced through.”
14852	24	1	7	1	7	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Consider carefully your ways.
14853	24	1	8	1	8	Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified, says the LORD.
14854	24	1	9	1	9	You expected much, but behold, it amounted to little. And what you brought home, I blew away. Why? declares the LORD of Hosts. Because My house still lies in ruins, while each of you is busy with his own house.
14855	24	1	10	1	10	Therefore, on account of you the heavens have withheld their dew and the earth has withheld its crops.
14856	24	1	11	1	11	I have summoned a drought on the fields and on the mountains, on the grain, new wine, and olive oil, and on whatever the ground yields, on man and beast, and on all the labor of your hands.”
14857	24	1	12	1	12	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD.
14858	24	1	13	1	13	Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, delivered the message of the LORD to the people: “I am with you,” declares the LORD.
14859	24	1	14	1	14	So the LORD stirred the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and began the work on the house of the LORD of Hosts, their God,
14860	24	1	15	1	15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
14861	24	2	1	2	1	On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
14862	24	2	2	2	2	“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and also to the remnant of the people. Ask them,
14863	24	2	3	2	3	‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not appear to you like nothing in comparison?’
14864	24	2	4	2	4	But now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the LORD. Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD. Work! For I am with you, declares the LORD of Hosts.
14865	24	2	5	2	5	This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you; do not be afraid.”
14866	24	2	6	2	6	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.
14867	24	2	7	2	7	I will shake all the nations, and they will come with all their treasures, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of Hosts.
14868	24	2	8	2	8	The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, declares the LORD of Hosts.
14869	24	2	9	2	9	The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says the LORD of Hosts. And in this place I will provide peace, declares the LORD of Hosts.”
14870	24	2	10	2	10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Haggai the prophet, saying,
14871	24	2	11	2	11	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Ask the priests for a ruling.
14872	24	2	12	2	12	If a man carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does that item become holy?’” “No,” replied the priests.
14873	24	2	13	2	13	So Haggai asked, “If one who is defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?” “Yes, it becomes defiled,” the priests answered.
14874	24	2	14	2	14	Then Haggai replied, “So it is with this people and this nation before Me, declares the LORD, and so it is with every work of their hands; whatever they offer there is defiled.
14875	24	2	15	2	15	Now consider carefully from this day forward: Before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the LORD,
14876	24	2	16	2	16	from that time, when one came expecting a heap of twenty ephahs of grain, there were but ten. When one came to the winepress to draw out fifty baths, there were but twenty.
14877	24	2	17	2	17	I struck you—all the work of your hands—with blight, mildew, and hail, but you did not turn to Me, declares the LORD.
14878	24	2	18	2	18	Consider carefully from this day forward—from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid—consider carefully:
14879	24	2	19	2	19	Is there still seed in the barn? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet yielded fruit. But from this day on, I will bless you.”
14880	24	2	20	2	20	For the second time that day, the twenty-fourth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to Haggai, saying,
14881	24	2	21	2	21	“Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth:
14882	24	2	22	2	22	I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overturn chariots and their riders; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.
14883	24	2	23	2	23	On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, I will take you, My servant, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, declares the LORD, and I will make you like My signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the LORD of Hosts.”
14884	25	1	1	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying:
14885	25	1	2	1	2	“The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
14886	25	1	3	1	3	So tell the people that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts.’
14887	25	1	4	1	4	Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Turn now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But they did not listen or pay attention to Me, declares the LORD.
14888	25	1	5	1	5	Where are your fathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
14889	25	1	6	1	6	But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? They repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.’”
14890	25	1	7	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo.
14891	25	1	8	1	8	I looked out into the night and saw a man riding on a red horse that stood among the myrtle trees in the hollow. Behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
14892	25	1	9	1	9	“What are these, my lord?” I asked. And the angel who was speaking with me replied, “I will show you what they are.”
14893	25	1	10	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.”
14894	25	1	11	1	11	And the riders answered the angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.”
14895	25	1	12	1	12	Then the angel of the LORD said, “How long, O LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”
14896	25	1	13	1	13	So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
14897	25	1	14	1	14	Then the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
14898	25	1	15	1	15	but I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease. For I was a little angry, but they added to the calamity.’
14899	25	1	16	1	16	Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there My house will be rebuilt, declares the LORD of Hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’
14900	25	1	17	1	17	Proclaim further that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’”
14901	25	2	1	1	18	Then I looked up and saw four horns.
14902	25	2	2	1	19	So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” And he told me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
14903	25	2	3	1	20	Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
14904	25	2	4	1	21	“What are these coming to do?” I asked. And He replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head; but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
14905	25	2	5	2	1	Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
14906	25	2	6	2	2	“Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”
14907	25	2	7	2	3	Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him
14908	25	2	8	2	4	and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.
14909	25	2	9	2	5	For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’”
14910	25	2	10	2	6	“Get up! Get up! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD.
14911	25	2	11	2	7	“Get up, O Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon!”
14912	25	2	12	2	8	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “After His Glory has sent Me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye—
14913	25	2	13	2	9	I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”
14914	25	2	14	2	10	“Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD.
14915	25	2	15	2	11	“On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD, and they will become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.
14916	25	2	16	2	12	And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem.
14917	25	2	17	2	13	Be silent before the LORD, all people, for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”
14918	25	3	1	3	1	Then the angel showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
14919	25	3	2	3	2	And the LORD said to Satan: “The LORD rebukes you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you! Is not this man a firebrand snatched from the fire?”
14920	25	3	3	3	3	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the angel.
14921	25	3	4	3	4	So the angel said to those standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes!” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”
14922	25	3	5	3	5	Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him, as the angel of the LORD stood by.
14923	25	3	6	3	6	Then the angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:
14924	25	3	7	3	7	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, then you will govern My house and will also have charge of My courts; and I will give you a place among these standing here.
14925	25	3	8	3	8	Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.
14926	25	3	9	3	9	See the stone I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave on it an inscription, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
14927	25	3	10	3	10	On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, you will each invite your neighbor to sit under your own vine and fig tree.’”
14928	25	4	1	4	1	Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and woke me, as a man is awakened from his sleep.
14929	25	4	2	4	2	“What do you see?” he asked. “I see a solid gold lampstand,” I replied, “with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven spouts to each of the lamps.
14930	25	4	3	4	3	There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left.”
14931	25	4	4	4	4	“What are these, my lord?” I asked the angel who was speaking with me.
14932	25	4	5	4	5	“Do you not know what they are?” replied the angel. “No, my lord,” I answered.
14933	25	4	6	4	6	So he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts.
14934	25	4	7	4	7	What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. Then he will bring forth the capstone accompanied by shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”
14935	25	4	8	4	8	Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
14936	25	4	9	4	9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.
14937	25	4	10	4	10	For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven eyes of the LORD, which scan the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.”
14938	25	4	11	4	11	Then I asked the angel, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”
14939	25	4	12	4	12	And I questioned him further, “What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the golden oil pours?”
14940	25	4	13	4	13	“Do you not know what these are?” he inquired. “No, my lord,” I replied.
14941	25	4	14	4	14	So he said, “These are the two anointed ones who are standing beside the Lord of all the earth.”
14942	25	5	1	5	1	Again I lifted up my eyes and saw before me a flying scroll.
14943	25	5	2	5	2	“What do you see?” asked the angel. “I see a flying scroll,” I replied, “twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.”
14944	25	5	3	5	3	Then he told me, “This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the land, for according to one side of the scroll, every thief will be removed; and according to the other side, every perjurer will be removed.
14945	25	5	4	5	4	I will send it out, declares the LORD of Hosts, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by My name. It will remain inside his house and destroy it, down to its timbers and stones.”
14946	25	5	5	5	5	Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and told me, “Now lift up your eyes and see what is approaching.”
14947	25	5	6	5	6	“What is it?” I asked. And he replied, “A measuring basket is going forth.” Then he continued, “This is their iniquity in all the land.”
14948	25	5	7	5	7	And behold, the cover of lead was raised, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.
14949	25	5	8	5	8	“This is Wickedness,” he said. And he shoved her down into the basket, pushing down the lead cover over its opening.
14950	25	5	9	5	9	Then I lifted up my eyes and saw two women approaching, with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
14951	25	5	10	5	10	“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking with me.
14952	25	5	11	5	11	“To build a house for it in the land of Shinar,” he told me. “And when it is ready, the basket will be set there on its pedestal.”
14953	25	6	1	6	1	And again I lifted up my eyes and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
14954	25	6	2	6	2	The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses,
14955	25	6	3	6	3	the third white horses, and the fourth dappled horses—all of them strong.
14956	25	6	4	6	4	So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”
14957	25	6	5	6	5	And the angel told me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth from their station before the Lord of all the earth.
14958	25	6	6	6	6	The one with the black horses is going toward the land of the north, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”
14959	25	6	7	6	7	As the strong horses went out, they were eager to go and patrol the earth; and the LORD said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth.
14960	25	6	8	6	8	Then the LORD summoned me and said, “Behold, those going to the land of the north have given rest to My Spirit in the land of the north.”
14961	25	6	9	6	9	The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,
14962	25	6	10	6	10	“Take an offering from the exiles—from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon—and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
14963	25	6	11	6	11	Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.
14964	25	6	12	6	12	And you are to tell him that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Here is a man whose name is the Branch, and He will branch out from His place and build the temple of the LORD.
14965	25	6	13	6	13	Yes, He will build the temple of the LORD; He will be clothed in splendor and will sit on His throne and rule. And He will be a priest on His throne, and there will be peaceful counsel between the two.’
14966	25	6	14	6	14	The crown will reside in the temple of the LORD as a memorial to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and the gracious son of Zephaniah.
14967	25	6	15	6	15	Even those far away will come and build the temple of the LORD, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.”
14968	25	7	1	7	1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.
14969	25	7	2	7	2	Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, along with their men, to plead before the LORD
14970	25	7	3	7	3	by asking the priests of the house of the LORD of Hosts, as well as the prophets, “Should I weep and fast in the fifth month, as I have done these many years?”
14971	25	7	4	7	4	Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying,
14972	25	7	5	7	5	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, was it really for Me that you fasted?
14973	25	7	6	7	6	And when you were eating and drinking, were you not doing so simply for yourselves?
14974	25	7	7	7	7	Are these not the words that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were populous and prosperous, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?’”
14975	25	7	8	7	8	Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
14976	25	7	9	7	9	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Administer true justice. Show loving devotion and compassion to one another.
14977	25	7	10	7	10	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. And do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.’
14978	25	7	11	7	11	But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder; they stopped up their ears from hearing.
14979	25	7	12	7	12	They made their hearts like flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.
14980	25	7	13	7	13	And just as I had called and they would not listen, so when they called I would not listen, says the LORD of Hosts.
14981	25	7	14	7	14	But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known, and the land was left desolate behind them so that no one could come or go. Thus they turned the pleasant land into a desolation.”
14982	25	8	1	8	1	Again the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying:
14983	25	8	2	8	2	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I am jealous for Zion with great zeal; I am jealous for her with great fervor.”
14984	25	8	3	8	3	This is what the LORD says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of Hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.”
14985	25	8	4	8	4	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Old men and old women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of great age.
14986	25	8	5	8	5	And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
14987	25	8	6	8	6	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “If this is impossible in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be impossible in My eyes?” declares the LORD of Hosts.
14988	25	8	7	8	7	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I will save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.
14989	25	8	8	8	8	I will bring them back to dwell in Jerusalem, where they will be My people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God.”
14990	25	8	9	8	9	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were present when the foundations were laid to rebuild the temple, the house of the LORD of Hosts.
14991	25	8	10	8	10	For before those days neither man nor beast received wages, nor was there safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I had turned every man against his neighbor.
14992	25	8	11	8	11	But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
14993	25	8	12	8	12	“For the seed will be prosperous, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will yield its produce, and the skies will give their dew. To the remnant of this people I will give all these things as an inheritance.
14994	25	8	13	8	13	As you have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid; let your hands be strong.”
14995	25	8	14	8	14	For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Just as I resolved to bring disaster upon you when your fathers provoked Me to anger, and I did not relent,” says the LORD of Hosts,
14996	25	8	15	8	15	“so now I have resolved to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
14997	25	8	16	8	16	These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another, render true and sound judgments in your gates,
14998	25	8	17	8	17	do not plot evil in your hearts against your neighbor, and do not love to swear falsely, for I hate all these things,” declares the LORD.
14999	25	8	18	8	18	Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying,
15000	25	8	19	8	19	“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: The fasts of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months will become times of joy and gladness, cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore you are to love both truth and peace.”
15001	25	8	20	8	20	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Peoples will yet come—the residents of many cities—
15002	25	8	21	8	21	and the residents of one city will go to another, saying: ‘Let us go at once to plead before the LORD and to seek the LORD of Hosts. I myself am going.’
15003	25	8	22	8	22	And many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of Hosts in Jerusalem and to plead before the LORD.”
15004	25	8	23	8	23	This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue will tightly grasp the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’”
15005	25	9	1	9	1	This is the burden of the word of the LORD against the land of Hadrach and Damascus its resting place—for the eyes of men and of all the tribes of Israel are upon the LORD—
15006	25	9	2	9	2	and also against Hamath, which borders it, as well as Tyre and Sidon, though they are very shrewd.
15007	25	9	3	9	3	Tyre has built herself a fortress; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
15008	25	9	4	9	4	Behold, the Lord will impoverish her and cast her power into the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.
15009	25	9	5	9	5	Ashkelon will see and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, as will Ekron, for her hope will wither. There will cease to be a king in Gaza, and Ashkelon will be uninhabited.
15010	25	9	6	9	6	A mixed race will occupy Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
15011	25	9	7	9	7	I will remove the blood from their mouths and the abominations from between their teeth. Then they too will become a remnant for our God; they will become like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
15012	25	9	8	9	8	But I will camp around My house because of an army, because of those who march to and fro, and never again will an oppressor overrun My people, for now I keep watch with My own eyes.
15013	25	9	9	9	9	Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your King comes to you, righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
15014	25	9	10	9	10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be broken. Then He will proclaim peace to the nations; His dominion will extend from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
15015	25	9	11	9	11	As for you, because of the blood of My covenant, I will release your prisoners from the waterless pit.
15016	25	9	12	9	12	Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; even today I declare that I will restore to you double.
15017	25	9	13	9	13	For I will bend Judah as My bow and fit it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, O Zion, against the sons of Greece. I will make you like the sword of a mighty man.
15018	25	9	14	9	14	Then the LORD will appear over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning. The Lord GOD will sound the ram’s horn and advance in the whirlwinds of the south.
15019	25	9	15	9	15	The LORD of Hosts will shield them. They will destroy and conquer with slingstones; they will drink and roar as with wine. And they will be filled like sprinkling bowls, drenched like the corners of the altar.
15020	25	9	16	9	16	On that day the LORD their God will save them as the flock of His people; for like jewels in a crown they will sparkle over His land.
15021	25	9	17	9	17	How lovely they will be, and how beautiful! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine, the young women.
15022	25	10	1	10	1	Ask the LORD for rain in springtime; the LORD makes the storm clouds, and He will give everyone showers of rain and crops in the field.
15023	25	10	2	10	2	For idols speak deceit and diviners see illusions; they tell false dreams and offer empty comfort. Therefore the people wander like sheep, oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
15024	25	10	3	10	3	“My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders. For the LORD of Hosts attends to His flock, the house of Judah; He will make them like His royal steed in battle.
15025	25	10	4	10	4	The cornerstone will come from Judah, the tent peg from him, as well as the battle bow and every ruler together.
15026	25	10	5	10	5	They will be like mighty men in battle, trampling the enemy in the mire of the streets. They will fight because the LORD is with them, and they will put the horsemen to shame.
15027	25	10	6	10	6	I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them, and they will be as though I had not rejected them. For I am the LORD their God, and I will answer them.
15028	25	10	7	10	7	Ephraim will be like a mighty man, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the LORD.
15029	25	10	8	10	8	I will whistle for them to gather, for I have redeemed them; and they will be as numerous as they once were.
15030	25	10	9	10	9	Though I sow them among the nations, they will remember Me in distant lands; they and their children will live and return.
15031	25	10	10	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon until no more room is found for them.
15032	25	10	11	10	11	They will pass through the sea of distress and strike the waves of the sea; all the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will depart.
15033	25	10	12	10	12	I will strengthen them in the LORD, and in His name they will walk,” declares the LORD.
15034	25	11	1	11	1	Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may consume your cedars!
15035	25	11	2	11	2	Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen; the majestic trees are ruined! Wail, O oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest has been cut down!
15036	25	11	3	11	3	Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is in ruins. Listen to the roaring of the young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are destroyed.
15037	25	11	4	11	4	This is what the LORD my God says: “Pasture the flock marked for slaughter,
15038	25	11	5	11	5	whose buyers slaughter them without remorse. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the LORD, for I am rich!’ Even their own shepherds have no compassion on them.
15039	25	11	6	11	6	For I will no longer have compassion on the people of the land, declares the LORD, but behold, I will cause each man to fall into the hands of his neighbor and his king, who will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from their hands.”
15040	25	11	7	11	7	So I pastured the flock marked for slaughter, especially the afflicted of the flock. Then I took for myself two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I pastured the flock.
15041	25	11	8	11	8	And in one month I dismissed three shepherds. My soul grew impatient with the flock, and their souls also detested me.
15042	25	11	9	11	9	Then I said, “I will no longer shepherd you. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish; and let those who remain devour one another’s flesh.”
15043	25	11	10	11	10	Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
15044	25	11	11	11	11	It was revoked on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD.
15045	25	11	12	11	12	Then I told them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.
15046	25	11	13	11	13	And the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—this magnificent price at which they valued me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
15047	25	11	14	11	14	Then I cut in two my second staff called Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
15048	25	11	15	11	15	And the LORD said to me: “Take up once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
15049	25	11	16	11	16	For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land who will neither care for the lost, nor seek the young, nor heal the broken, nor sustain the healthy, but he will devour the flesh of the choice sheep and tear off their hooves.
15050	25	11	17	11	17	Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May a sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered and his right eye utterly blinded!”
15051	25	12	1	12	1	This is the burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD, who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth, who forms the spirit of man within him:
15052	25	12	2	12	2	“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples. Judah will be besieged, as well as Jerusalem.
15053	25	12	3	12	3	On that day, when all the nations of the earth gather against her, I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who would heave it away will be severely injured.
15054	25	12	4	12	4	On that day, declares the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and every rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah, but I will strike with blindness all the horses of the nations.
15055	25	12	5	12	5	Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts: ‘The people of Jerusalem are my strength, for the LORD of Hosts is their God.’
15056	25	12	6	12	6	On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among the sheaves; they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and on the left, while the people of Jerusalem remain secure there.
15057	25	12	7	12	7	The LORD will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and of the people of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.
15058	25	12	8	12	8	On that day the LORD will defend the people of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD going before them.
15059	25	12	9	12	9	So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
15060	25	12	10	12	10	Then I will pour out on the house of David and on the people of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and prayer, and they will look on Me, the One they have pierced. They will mourn for Him as one mourns an only child, and weep bitterly for Him as one grieves a firstborn son.
15061	25	12	11	12	11	On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
15062	25	12	12	12	12	The land will mourn, each clan on its own: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,
15063	25	12	13	12	13	the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,
15064	25	12	14	12	14	and all the remaining clans and their wives.”
15065	25	13	1	13	1	“On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the people of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
15066	25	13	2	13	2	And on that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, I will erase the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered. I will also remove the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
15067	25	13	3	13	3	And if anyone still prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, ‘You shall not remain alive, because you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD.’ When he prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will pierce him through.
15068	25	13	4	13	4	And on that day every prophet who prophesies will be ashamed of his vision, and he will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive.
15069	25	13	5	13	5	He will say, ‘I am not a prophet; I work the land, for I was purchased as a servant in my youth.’
15070	25	13	6	13	6	If someone asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your chest?’ he will answer, ‘These are the wounds I received in the house of my friends.’
15071	25	13	7	13	7	Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, against the man who is My Companion, declares the LORD of Hosts. Strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn My hand against the little ones.
15072	25	13	8	13	8	And in all the land, declares the LORD, two-thirds will be cut off and perish, but a third will be left in it.
15073	25	13	9	13	9	This third I will bring through the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are My people,’ and they will say, ‘The LORD is our God.’”
15074	25	14	1	14	1	Behold, a day of the LORD is coming when your plunder will be divided in your presence.
15075	25	14	2	14	2	For I will gather all the nations for battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.
15076	25	14	3	14	3	Then the LORD will go out to fight against those nations, as He fights in the day of battle.
15077	25	14	4	14	4	On that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half the mountain moving to the north and half to the south.
15078	25	14	5	14	5	You will flee by My mountain valley, for it will extend to Azal. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with Him.
15079	25	14	6	14	6	On that day there will be no light, no cold or frost.
15080	25	14	7	14	7	It will be a day known only to the LORD, without day or night; but when evening comes, there will be light.
15081	25	14	8	14	8	And on that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it toward the Eastern Sea and the other half toward the Western Sea, in summer and winter alike.
15082	25	14	9	14	9	On that day the LORD will become King over all the earth—the LORD alone, and His name alone.
15083	25	14	10	14	10	All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will be turned into a plain, but Jerusalem will be raised up and will remain in her place, from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.
15084	25	14	11	14	11	People will live there, and never again will there be an utter destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell securely.
15085	25	14	12	14	12	And this will be the plague with which the LORD strikes all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
15086	25	14	13	14	13	On that day a great panic from the LORD will come upon them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will rise against the other.
15087	25	14	14	14	14	Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance.
15088	25	14	15	14	15	And a similar plague will strike the horses and mules, camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
15089	25	14	16	14	16	Then all the survivors from the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
15090	25	14	17	14	17	And should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, the rain will not fall on them.
15091	25	14	18	14	18	And if the people of Egypt will not go up and enter in, then rain will not fall on them; this will be the plague with which the LORD strikes the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
15092	25	14	19	14	19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
15093	25	14	20	14	20	On that day, HOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the house of the LORD will be like the sprinkling bowls before the altar.
15094	25	14	21	14	21	Indeed, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD of Hosts, and all who sacrifice will come and take some pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of Hosts.
15095	26	1	1	1	1	This is the burden of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi:
15096	26	1	2	1	2	“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you ask, “How have You loved us?” “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet Jacob I have loved,
15097	26	1	3	1	3	but Esau I have hated, and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”
15098	26	1	4	1	4	Though Edom may say, “We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.
15099	26	1	5	1	5	You will see this with your own eyes, and you yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel.’”
15100	26	1	6	1	6	“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. But if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is your fear of Me?” says the LORD of Hosts to you priests who despise My name. “But you ask, ‘How have we despised Your name?’
15101	26	1	7	1	7	By presenting defiled food on My altar. But you ask, ‘How have we defiled You?’ By saying that the table of the LORD is contemptible.”
15102	26	1	8	1	8	“When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is it not wrong? And when you present the lame and sick ones, is it not wrong? Why not offer them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you or show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.
15103	26	1	9	1	9	“But ask now for God’s favor. Will He be gracious? Since this has come from your hands, will He show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.
15104	26	1	10	1	10	“Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My altar! I take no pleasure in you,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and I will accept no offering from your hands.”
15105	26	1	11	1	11	“For My name will be great among the nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun. In every place, incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name, because My name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15106	26	1	12	1	12	“But you profane it when you say, ‘The table of the LORD is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is contemptible.’”
15107	26	1	13	1	13	“You also say: ‘Oh, what a nuisance!’ And you turn up your nose at it,” says the LORD of Hosts. “You bring offerings that are stolen, lame, or sick! Should I accept these from your hands?” asks the LORD.
15108	26	1	14	1	14	“But cursed is the deceiver who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but sacrifices a defective animal to the Lord. For I am a great King,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and My name is to be feared among the nations.”
15109	26	2	1	2	1	And now this decree is for you, O priests:
15110	26	2	2	2	2	“If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to honor My name,” says the LORD of Hosts, “I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already begun to curse them, because you are not taking it to heart.
15111	26	2	3	2	3	Behold, I will rebuke your descendants, and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts, and you will be carried off with it.”
15112	26	2	4	2	4	“Then you will know that I have sent you this commandment so that My covenant with Levi may continue,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15113	26	2	5	2	5	“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him; it called for reverence, and he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.
15114	26	2	6	2	6	True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
15115	26	2	7	2	7	For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.”
15116	26	2	8	2	8	“But you have departed from the way, and your instruction has caused many to stumble. You have violated the covenant of Levi,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15117	26	2	9	2	9	“So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”
15118	26	2	10	2	10	Do we not all have one Father? Did not one God create us? Why then do we break faith with one another so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
15119	26	2	11	2	11	Judah has broken faith; an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the LORD’s beloved sanctuary by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
15120	26	2	12	2	12	As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts.
15121	26	2	13	2	13	And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and groaning, because He no longer regards your offerings or receives them gladly from your hands.
15122	26	2	14	2	14	Yet you ask, “Why?” It is because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have broken faith, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
15123	26	2	15	2	15	Has not the LORD made them one, having a portion of the Spirit? And why one? Because He seeks godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.
15124	26	2	16	2	16	“For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel. “He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,” says the LORD of Hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith.
15125	26	2	17	2	17	You have wearied the LORD with your words; yet you ask, “How have we wearied Him?” By saying, “All who do evil are good in the sight of the LORD, and in them He delights,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”
15126	26	3	1	3	1	“Behold, I will send My messenger, who will prepare the way before Me. Then the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple—the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight—see, He is coming,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15127	26	3	2	3	2	But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer’s soap.
15128	26	3	3	3	3	And He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.
15129	26	3	4	3	4	Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will please the LORD, as in days of old and years gone by.
15130	26	3	5	3	5	“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers and perjurers, against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless, and against those who defraud laborers of their wages and deny justice to the foreigner but do not fear Me,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15131	26	3	6	3	6	“Because I, the LORD, do not change, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.
15132	26	3	7	3	7	Yet from the days of your fathers, you have turned away from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD of Hosts. “But you ask, ‘How can we return?’
15133	26	3	8	3	8	Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you ask, ‘How do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.
15134	26	3	9	3	9	You are cursed with a curse, yet you—the whole nation—are still robbing Me.
15135	26	3	10	3	10	Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this,” says the LORD of Hosts. “See if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out for you blessing without measure.
15136	26	3	11	3	11	I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your land, and the vine in your field will not fail to produce fruit,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15137	26	3	12	3	12	“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15138	26	3	13	3	13	“Your words against Me have been harsh,” says the LORD. “Yet you ask, ‘What have we spoken against You?’
15139	26	3	14	3	14	You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What have we gained by keeping His requirements and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?
15140	26	3	15	3	15	So now we call the arrogant blessed. Not only do evildoers prosper, they even test God and escape.’”
15141	26	3	16	3	16	At that time those who feared the LORD spoke with one another, and the LORD listened and heard them. So a scroll of remembrance was written before Him regarding those who feared the LORD and honored His name.
15142	26	3	17	3	17	“They will be Mine,” says the LORD of Hosts, “on the day when I prepare My treasured possession. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.
15143	26	3	18	3	18	So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.”
15144	26	3	19	4	1	“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of Hosts. “Not a root or branch will be left to them.”
15145	26	3	20	4	2	“But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall.
15146	26	3	21	4	3	Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing,” says the LORD of Hosts.
15147	26	3	22	4	4	“Remember the law of Moses My servant, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.
15148	26	3	23	4	5	Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful Day of the LORD.
15149	26	3	24	4	6	And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.”
15150	27	1	1	1	1	Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or set foot on the path of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers.
15151	27	1	2	1	2	But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.
15152	27	1	3	1	3	He is like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither, and who prospers in all he does.
15153	27	1	4	1	4	Not so the wicked! For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.
15154	27	1	5	1	5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
15155	27	1	6	1	6	For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
15156	27	2	1	2	1	Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
15157	27	2	2	2	2	The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:
15158	27	2	3	2	3	“Let us break Their chains and cast away Their cords.”
15159	27	2	4	2	4	The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord taunts them.
15160	27	2	5	2	5	Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them in His fury:
15161	27	2	6	2	6	“I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy mountain.”
15162	27	2	7	2	7	I will proclaim the decree spoken to Me by the LORD: “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.
15163	27	2	8	2	8	Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession.
15164	27	2	9	2	9	You will break them with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery.”
15165	27	2	10	2	10	Therefore be wise, O kings; be admonished, O judges of the earth.
15166	27	2	11	2	11	Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
15167	27	2	12	2	12	Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, when His wrath ignites in an instant. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
15168	27	3	1	3	0	A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.
15169	27	3	2	3	1	O LORD, how my foes have increased! How many rise up against me!
15170	27	3	3	3	2	Many say of me, “God will not deliver him.” Selah
15171	27	3	4	3	3	But You, O LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the One who lifts my head.
15172	27	3	5	3	4	To the LORD I cry aloud, and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah
15173	27	3	6	3	5	I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.
15174	27	3	7	3	6	I will not fear the myriads set against me on every side.
15175	27	3	8	3	7	Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.

15179	27	4	3	4	2	How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies? Selah
15180	27	4	4	4	3	Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.
15181	27	4	5	4	4	Be angry, yet do not sin; on your bed, search your heart and be still. Selah
15182	27	4	6	4	5	Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the LORD.
15183	27	4	7	4	6	Many ask, “Who can show us the good?” Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.
15184	27	4	8	4	7	You have filled my heart with more joy than when grain and new wine abound.
15185	27	4	9	4	8	I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.

15187	27	5	2	5	1	Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.
15188	27	5	3	5	2	Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.
15189	27	5	4	5	3	In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation.
15190	27	5	5	5	4	For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.
15191	27	5	6	5	5	The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity.
15192	27	5	7	5	6	You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.
15193	27	5	8	5	7	But I will enter Your house by the abundance of Your loving devotion; in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.
15194	27	5	9	5	8	Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.
15195	27	5	10	5	9	For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction lies within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.
15196	27	5	11	5	10	Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
15197	27	5	12	5	11	But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.
15198	27	5	13	5	12	For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of Your favor.

15202	27	6	4	6	3	My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long?
15203	27	6	5	6	4	Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion.
15204	27	6	6	6	5	For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol?
15205	27	6	7	6	6	I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
15206	27	6	8	6	7	My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes.
15207	27	6	9	6	8	Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping.
15208	27	6	10	6	9	The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.

15213	27	7	4	7	3	O LORD my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,
15214	27	7	5	7	4	if I have rewarded my ally with evil, if I have plundered my foe without cause,
15215	27	7	6	7	5	then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah
15216	27	7	7	7	6	Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; rise up against the fury of my enemies. Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.
15217	27	7	8	7	7	Let the assembled peoples encompass You; take Your seat over them on high.
15218	27	7	9	7	8	The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity.
15219	27	7	10	7	9	Put an end to the evil of the wicked, but establish the righteous, O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.
15220	27	7	11	7	10	My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
15221	27	7	12	7	11	God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation each day.
15222	27	7	13	7	12	If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow.
15223	27	7	14	7	13	He has prepared His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire.
15224	27	7	15	7	14	Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; he conceives trouble and births falsehood.
15225	27	7	16	7	15	He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; he has fallen into a pit of his own making.
15226	27	7	17	7	16	His trouble recoils on himself, and his violence falls on his own head.
15227	27	7	18	7	17	I will thank the LORD for His righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.

15230	27	8	3	8	2	From the mouths of children and infants You have ordained praise on account of Your adversaries, to silence the enemy and avenger.
15231	27	8	4	8	3	When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in place—
15232	27	8	5	8	4	what is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?
15233	27	8	6	8	5	You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.
15234	27	8	7	8	6	You made him ruler of the works of Your hands; You have placed everything under his feet:
15235	27	8	8	8	7	all sheep and oxen, and even the beasts of the field,
15236	27	8	9	8	8	the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
15237	27	8	10	8	9	O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
15238	27	9	1	9	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David. 
15239	27	9	2	9	1	I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.
15240	27	9	3	9	2	I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
15241	27	9	4	9	3	When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.
15242	27	9	5	9	4	For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously.
15243	27	9	6	9	5	You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.
15244	27	9	7	9	6	The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished.
15245	27	9	8	9	7	But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment.
15246	27	9	9	9	8	He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity.
15247	27	9	10	9	9	The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
15248	27	9	11	9	10	Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.
15249	27	9	12	9	11	Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.
15250	27	9	13	9	12	For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.
15251	27	9	14	9	13	Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Lift me up from the gates of death,
15252	27	9	15	9	14	that I may declare all Your praises—that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.
15253	27	9	16	9	15	The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
15254	27	9	17	9	16	The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion Selah
15255	27	9	18	9	17	The wicked will return to Sheol—all the nations who forget God.
15256	27	9	19	9	18	For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.
15257	27	9	20	9	19	Rise up, O LORD, let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.
15258	27	9	21	9	20	Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
15259	27	10	1	10	1	Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?
15260	27	10	2	10	2	In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.
15261	27	10	3	10	3	For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.
15262	27	10	4	10	4	In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.
15263	27	10	5	10	5	He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.
15264	27	10	6	10	6	He says to himself, “I will not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress.”
15265	27	10	7	10	7	His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.
15266	27	10	8	10	8	He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.
15267	27	10	9	10	9	He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.
15268	27	10	10	10	10	They are crushed and beaten down; the hapless fall prey to his strength.
15269	27	10	11	10	11	He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees.”
15270	27	10	12	10	12	Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! Do not forget the helpless.
15271	27	10	13	10	13	Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”
15272	27	10	14	10	14	But You have regarded trouble and grief; You see to repay it by Your hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.
15273	27	10	15	10	15	Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call him to account for his wickedness until none is left to be found.
15274	27	10	16	10	16	The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.
15275	27	10	17	10	17	You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,
15276	27	10	18	10	18	to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
15277	27	11	1	11	1	For the choirmaster. Of David. In the LORD I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain!
15278	27	11	2	11	2	For behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrow on the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
15279	27	11	3	11	3	If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”
15280	27	11	4	11	4	The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne. His eyes are watching closely; they examine the sons of men.
15281	27	11	5	11	5	The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.
15282	27	11	6	11	6	On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur; a scorching wind will be their portion.
15283	27	11	7	11	7	For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice. The upright will see His face.
15284	27	12	1	12	0	For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. 
15285	27	12	2	12	1	Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.
15286	27	12	3	12	2	They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.
15287	27	12	4	12	3	May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue.
15288	27	12	5	12	4	They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lips—who can be our master?”
15289	27	12	6	12	5	“For the cause of the oppressed and for the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the LORD. “I will bring safety to him who yearns.”
15290	27	12	7	12	6	The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold.
15291	27	12	8	12	7	You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation.
15292	27	12	9	12	8	The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.
15293	27	13	1	13	1	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
15294	27	13	2	13	2	How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me?
15295	27	13	3	13	3	Consider me and respond, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,
15296	27	13	4	13	4	lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,” and my foes rejoice when I fall.
15297	27	13	5	13	5	But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.
15298	27	13	6	13	6	I will sing to the LORD, for He has been good to me.
15299	27	14	1	14	1	For the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good.
15300	27	14	2	14	2	The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.
15301	27	14	3	14	3	All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
15302	27	14	4	14	4	Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.
15303	27	14	5	14	5	There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous.
15304	27	14	6	14	6	You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter.
15305	27	14	7	14	7	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
15306	27	15	1	15	1	A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?
15307	27	15	2	15	2	He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart,
15308	27	15	3	15	3	who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend,
15309	27	15	4	15	4	who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath,
15310	27	15	5	15	5	who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
15311	27	16	1	16	1	A Miktam of David. Preserve me, O God, for in You I take refuge.
15312	27	16	2	16	2	I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from You I have no good thing.”
15313	27	16	3	16	3	As for the saints in the land, they are the excellence in whom all my delight resides.
15314	27	16	4	16	4	Sorrows will multiply to those who chase other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood, or speak their names with my lips.
15315	27	16	5	16	5	The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You have made my lot secure.
15316	27	16	6	16	6	The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; surely my inheritance is delightful.
15317	27	16	7	16	7	I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my conscience instructs me.
15318	27	16	8	16	8	I have set the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
15319	27	16	9	16	9	Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will dwell securely.
15320	27	16	10	16	10	For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.
15321	27	16	11	16	11	You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence, with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
15322	27	17	1	17	1	A prayer of David. Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.
15323	27	17	2	17	2	May my vindication come from Your presence; may Your eyes see what is right.
15324	27	17	3	17	3	You have tried my heart; You have visited me in the night. You have tested me and found no evil; I have resolved not to sin with my mouth.
15325	27	17	4	17	4	As for the deeds of men—by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
15326	27	17	5	17	5	My steps have held to Your paths; my feet have not slipped.
15327	27	17	6	17	6	I call on You, O God, for You will answer me. Incline Your ear to me; hear my words.
15328	27	17	7	17	7	Show the wonders of Your loving devotion, You who save by Your right hand those who seek refuge from their foes.
15329	27	17	8	17	8	Keep me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings
15330	27	17	9	17	9	from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.
15331	27	17	10	17	10	They have closed their callous hearts; their mouths speak with arrogance.
15332	27	17	11	17	11	They have tracked us down, and now surround us; their eyes are set to cast us to the ground,
15333	27	17	12	17	12	like a lion greedy for prey, like a young lion lurking in ambush.
15334	27	17	13	17	13	Arise, O LORD, confront them! Bring them to their knees; deliver me from the wicked by Your sword,
15335	27	17	14	17	14	from such men, O LORD, by Your hand, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. May You fill the bellies of Your treasured ones and satisfy their sons, so they leave their abundance to their children.
15336	27	17	15	17	15	As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied in Your presence.
15337	27	18	1	18	0	For the choirmaster. Of David the servant of the LORD, who sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
15338	27	18	2	18	1	He said: I love You, O LORD, my strength.
15339	27	18	3	18	2	The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
15340	27	18	4	18	3	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies.
15341	27	18	5	18	4	The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me.
15342	27	18	6	18	5	The cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
15343	27	18	7	18	6	In my distress I called upon the LORD and I cried to my God for help. From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry for His help reached His ears.
15344	27	18	8	18	7	Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains trembled; they were shaken because He burned with anger.
15345	27	18	9	18	8	Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; glowing coals flamed forth.
15346	27	18	10	18	9	He parted the heavens and came down with dark clouds under His feet.
15347	27	18	11	18	10	He mounted a cherub and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind.
15348	27	18	12	18	11	He made darkness His hiding place, and storm clouds a canopy around Him.
15349	27	18	13	18	12	From the brightness of His presence His clouds advanced—hailstones and coals of fire.
15350	27	18	14	18	13	The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded—hailstones and coals of fire.
15351	27	18	15	18	14	He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; He hurled lightning and routed them.
15352	27	18	16	18	15	The channels of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
15353	27	18	17	18	16	He reached from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of deep waters.
15354	27	18	18	18	17	He rescued me from my powerful enemy and from foes too mighty for me.
15355	27	18	19	18	18	They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD was my support.
15356	27	18	20	18	19	He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
15357	27	18	21	18	20	The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
15358	27	18	22	18	21	For I have kept the ways of the LORD and have not wickedly departed from my God.
15359	27	18	23	18	22	For all His ordinances are before me; I have not disregarded His statutes.
15360	27	18	24	18	23	And I have been blameless before Him and kept myself from iniquity.
15361	27	18	25	18	24	So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
15362	27	18	26	18	25	To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, to the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
15363	27	18	27	18	26	to the pure You show Yourself pure, but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.
15364	27	18	28	18	27	For You save an afflicted people, but You humble those with haughty eyes.
15365	27	18	29	18	28	For You, O LORD, light my lamp; my God lights up my darkness.
15366	27	18	30	18	29	For in You I can charge an army, and with my God I can scale a wall.
15367	27	18	31	18	30	As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
15368	27	18	32	18	31	For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?
15369	27	18	33	18	32	It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way clear.
15370	27	18	34	18	33	He makes my feet like those of a deer and stations me upon the heights.
15371	27	18	35	18	34	He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
15372	27	18	36	18	35	You have given me Your shield of salvation; Your right hand upholds me, and Your gentleness exalts me.
15373	27	18	37	18	36	You broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not give way.
15374	27	18	38	18	37	I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back until they were consumed.
15375	27	18	39	18	38	I crushed them so they could not rise; they have fallen under my feet.
15376	27	18	40	18	39	You have armed me with strength for battle; You have subdued my foes beneath me.
15377	27	18	41	18	40	You have made my enemies retreat before me; I put an end to those who hated me.
15378	27	18	42	18	41	They cried for help, but there was no one to save them—to the LORD, but He did not answer.
15379	27	18	43	18	42	I ground them as dust in the face of the wind; I trampled them like mud in the streets.
15380	27	18	44	18	43	You have delivered me from the strife of the people; You have made me the head of nations; a people I had not known shall serve me.
15381	27	18	45	18	44	When they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cower before me.
15382	27	18	46	18	45	Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds.
15383	27	18	47	18	46	The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock! And may the God of my salvation be exalted—
15384	27	18	48	18	47	the God who avenges me and subdues nations beneath me,
15385	27	18	49	18	48	who delivers me from my enemies. You exalt me above my foes; You rescue me from violent men.
15386	27	18	50	18	49	Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name.
15387	27	18	51	18	50	Great salvation He brings to His king. He shows loving devotion to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
15388	27	19	1	19	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
15389	27	19	2	19	1	The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.
15390	27	19	3	19	2	Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
15391	27	19	4	19	3	Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard,
15392	27	19	5	19	4	their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun
15393	27	19	6	19	5	like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
15394	27	19	7	19	6	It rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.
15395	27	19	8	19	7	The Law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple.
15396	27	19	9	19	8	The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
15397	27	19	10	19	9	The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.
15398	27	19	11	19	10	They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.
15399	27	19	12	19	11	By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward.
15400	27	19	13	19	12	Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.
15401	27	19	14	19	13	Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression.
15402	27	19	15	19	14	May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
15403	27	20	1	20	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. 
15404	27	20	2	20	1	May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
15405	27	20	3	20	2	May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.
15406	27	20	4	20	3	May He remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. Selah
15407	27	20	5	20	4	May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
15408	27	20	6	20	5	May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your petitions.
15409	27	20	7	20	6	Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.
15410	27	20	8	20	7	Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.
15411	27	20	9	20	8	They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.
15412	27	20	10	20	9	O LORD, save the king. Answer us on the day we call.
15413	27	21	1	21	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. 
15414	27	21	2	21	1	O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength. How greatly he exults in Your salvation!
15415	27	21	3	21	2	You have granted his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
15416	27	21	4	21	3	For You welcomed him with rich blessings; You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.
15417	27	21	5	21	4	He asked You for life, and You granted it—length of days, forever and ever.
15418	27	21	6	21	5	Great is his glory in Your salvation; You bestow on him splendor and majesty.
15419	27	21	7	21	6	For You grant him blessings forever; You cheer him with joy in Your presence.
15420	27	21	8	21	7	For the king trusts in the LORD; through the loving devotion of the Most High, he will not be shaken.
15421	27	21	9	21	8	Your hand will apprehend all Your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate You.
15422	27	21	10	21	9	You will place them in a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. In His wrath the LORD will engulf them, and the fire will consume them.
15423	27	21	11	21	10	You will wipe their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from the sons of men.
15424	27	21	12	21	11	Though they intend You harm, the schemes they devise will not prevail.
15425	27	21	13	21	12	For You will put them to flight when Your bow is trained upon them.
15426	27	21	14	21	13	Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.
15427	27	22	1	22	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.” A Psalm of David. 
15428	27	22	2	22	1	My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from saving me, so far from my words of groaning?
15429	27	22	3	22	2	I cry out by day, O my God, but You do not answer, and by night, but I have no rest.
15430	27	22	4	22	3	Yet You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
15431	27	22	5	22	4	In You our fathers trusted; they trusted and You delivered them.
15432	27	22	6	22	5	They cried out to You and were set free; they trusted in You and were not disappointed.
15433	27	22	7	22	6	But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people.
15434	27	22	8	22	7	All who see me mock me; they sneer and shake their heads:
15435	27	22	9	22	8	“He trusts in the LORD, let the LORD deliver him; let the LORD rescue him, since He delights in him.”
15436	27	22	10	22	9	Yet You brought me forth from the womb; You made me secure at my mother’s breast.
15437	27	22	11	22	10	From birth I was cast upon You; from my mother’s womb You have been my God.
15438	27	22	12	22	11	Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
15439	27	22	13	22	12	Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
15440	27	22	14	22	13	They open their jaws against me like lions that roar and maul.
15441	27	22	15	22	14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed. My heart is like wax; it melts away within me.
15442	27	22	16	22	15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You lay me in the dust of death.
15443	27	22	17	22	16	For dogs surround me; a band of evil men encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet.
15444	27	22	18	22	17	I can count all my bones; they stare and gloat over me.
15445	27	22	19	22	18	They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.
15446	27	22	20	22	19	But You, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help.
15447	27	22	21	22	20	Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of wild dogs.
15448	27	22	22	22	21	Save me from the mouth of the lion; at the horns of the wild oxen You have answered me!
15449	27	22	23	22	22	I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; I will praise You in the assembly.
15450	27	22	24	22	23	You who fear the LORD, praise Him! All descendants of Jacob, honor Him! All offspring of Israel, revere Him!
15451	27	22	25	22	24	For He has not despised or detested the torment of the afflicted. He has not hidden His face from him, but has attended to his cry for help.
15452	27	22	26	22	25	From You comes my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear You I will fulfill my vows.
15453	27	22	27	22	26	The poor will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the LORD will praise Him. May your hearts live forever!
15454	27	22	28	22	27	All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD. All the families of the nations will bow down before Him.
15455	27	22	29	22	28	For dominion belongs to the LORD and He rules over the nations.
15456	27	22	30	22	29	All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him—even those unable to preserve their lives.
15457	27	22	31	22	30	Posterity will serve Him; they will declare the Lord to a new generation.
15458	27	22	32	22	31	They will come and proclaim His righteousness to a people yet unborn—all that He has done.
15459	27	23	1	23	1	A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
15460	27	23	2	23	2	He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
15461	27	23	3	23	3	He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.
15462	27	23	4	23	4	Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
15463	27	23	5	23	5	You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
15464	27	23	6	23	6	Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
15465	27	24	1	24	1	A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof, the world and all who dwell therein.
15466	27	24	2	24	2	For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.
15467	27	24	3	24	3	Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?
15468	27	24	4	24	4	He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear deceitfully.
15469	27	24	5	24	5	He shall receive blessing from the LORD, and vindication from the God of his salvation.
15470	27	24	6	24	6	Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob. Selah
15471	27	24	7	24	7	Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!
15472	27	24	8	24	8	Who is this King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
15473	27	24	9	24	9	Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!
15474	27	24	10	24	10	Who is He, this King of Glory? The LORD of Hosts—He is the King of Glory. Selah
15475	27	25	1	25	1	Of David. To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul;
15476	27	25	2	25	2	in You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.
15477	27	25	3	25	3	Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who are faithless without cause will be disgraced.
15478	27	25	4	25	4	Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.
15479	27	25	5	25	5	Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You.
15480	27	25	6	25	6	Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion, for they are from age to age.
15481	27	25	7	25	7	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellious acts; remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness, O LORD.
15482	27	25	8	25	8	Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way.
15483	27	25	9	25	9	He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.
15484	27	25	10	25	10	All the LORD’s ways are loving and faithful to those who keep His covenant and His decrees.
15485	27	25	11	25	11	For the sake of Your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great.
15486	27	25	12	25	12	Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the path chosen for him.
15487	27	25	13	25	13	His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.
15488	27	25	14	25	14	The LORD confides in those who fear Him, and reveals His covenant to them.
15489	27	25	15	25	15	My eyes are always on the LORD, for He will free my feet from the mesh.
15490	27	25	16	25	16	Turn to me and be gracious, for I am lonely and afflicted.
15491	27	25	17	25	17	The troubles of my heart increase; free me from my distress.
15492	27	25	18	25	18	Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins.
15493	27	25	19	25	19	Consider my enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with vicious hatred.
15494	27	25	20	25	20	Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.
15495	27	25	21	25	21	May integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for You.
15496	27	25	22	25	22	Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
15497	27	26	1	26	1	Of David. Vindicate me, O LORD! For I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
15498	27	26	2	26	2	Test me, O LORD, and try me; examine my heart and mind.
15499	27	26	3	26	3	For Your loving devotion is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.
15500	27	26	4	26	4	I do not sit with deceitful men, nor keep company with hypocrites.
15501	27	26	5	26	5	I hate the mob of evildoers, and refuse to sit with the wicked.
15502	27	26	6	26	6	I wash my hands in innocence that I may go about Your altar, O LORD,
15503	27	26	7	26	7	to raise my voice in thanksgiving and declare all Your wonderful works.
15504	27	26	8	26	8	O LORD, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.
15505	27	26	9	26	9	Do not take my soul away with sinners, or my life with men of bloodshed,
15506	27	26	10	26	10	in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.
15507	27	26	11	26	11	But I will walk with integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.
15508	27	26	12	26	12	My feet stand on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
15509	27	27	1	27	1	Of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life—whom shall I dread?
15510	27	27	2	27	2	When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh, my enemies and foes stumbled and fell.
15511	27	27	3	27	3	Though an army encamps around me, my heart will not fear; though a war breaks out against me, I will keep my trust.
15512	27	27	4	27	4	One thing I have asked of the LORD; this is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the LORD and seek Him in His temple.
15513	27	27	5	27	5	For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter; He will conceal me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high upon a rock.
15514	27	27	6	27	6	Then my head will be held high above my enemies around me. At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.
15515	27	27	7	27	7	Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call; be merciful and answer me.
15516	27	27	8	27	8	My heart said, “Seek His face.” Your face, O LORD, I will seek.
15517	27	27	9	27	9	Hide not Your face from me, nor turn away Your servant in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my salvation.
15518	27	27	10	27	10	Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.
15519	27	27	11	27	11	Teach me Your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path, because of my oppressors.
15520	27	27	12	27	12	Do not hand me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.
15521	27	27	13	27	13	Still I am certain to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
15522	27	27	14	27	14	Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous. Wait patiently for the LORD!
15523	27	28	1	28	1	Of David. To You, O LORD, I call; be not deaf to me, O my Rock. For if You remain silent, I will be like those descending to the Pit.
15524	27	28	2	28	2	Hear my cry for mercy when I call to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.
15525	27	28	3	28	3	Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts.
15526	27	28	4	28	4	Repay them according to their deeds, and for their works of evil. Repay them for what their hands have done; bring back on them what they deserve.
15527	27	28	5	28	5	Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done, He will tear them down and never rebuild them.
15528	27	28	6	28	6	Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard my cry for mercy.
15529	27	28	7	28	7	The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I give thanks to Him with my song.
15530	27	28	8	28	8	The LORD is the strength of His people, a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.
15531	27	28	9	28	9	Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
15532	27	29	1	29	1	A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
15533	27	29	2	29	2	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness.
15534	27	29	3	29	3	The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is heard over many waters.
15535	27	29	4	29	4	The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.
15536	27	29	5	29	5	The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
15537	27	29	6	29	6	He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.
15538	27	29	7	29	7	The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire.
15539	27	29	8	29	8	The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh.
15540	27	29	9	29	9	The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in His temple all cry, “Glory!”
15541	27	29	10	29	10	The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever.
15542	27	29	11	29	11	The LORD gives His people strength; the LORD blesses His people with peace.
15543	27	30	1	30	0	A Psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David.
15544	27	30	2	30	1	I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.
15545	27	30	3	30	2	O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.
15546	27	30	4	30	3	O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol; You spared me from descending into the Pit.
15547	27	30	5	30	4	Sing to the LORD, O you His saints, and praise His holy name.
15548	27	30	6	30	5	For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the morning.
15549	27	30	7	30	6	In prosperity I said, “I will never be shaken.”
15550	27	30	8	30	7	O LORD, You favored me; You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was dismayed.
15551	27	30	9	30	8	To You, O LORD, I called, and I begged my Lord for mercy:
15552	27	30	10	30	9	“What gain is there in my bloodshed, in my descent to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?
15553	27	30	11	30	10	Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy; O LORD, be my helper.”
15554	27	30	12	30	11	You turned my mourning into dancing; You peeled off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
15555	27	30	13	30	12	that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks forever.
15556	27	31	1	31	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
15557	27	31	2	31	1	In You, O LORD, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; save me by Your righteousness.
15558	27	31	3	31	2	Incline Your ear to me; come quickly to my rescue. Be my rock of refuge, the stronghold of my deliverance.
15559	27	31	4	31	3	For You are my rock and my fortress; lead and guide me for the sake of Your name.
15560	27	31	5	31	4	You free me from the net laid out for me, for You are my refuge.
15561	27	31	6	31	5	Into Your hands I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O LORD, God of truth.
15562	27	31	7	31	6	I hate those who cling to worthless idols, but in the LORD I trust.
15563	27	31	8	31	7	I will be glad and rejoice in Your loving devotion, for You have seen my affliction; You have known the anguish of my soul.
15564	27	31	9	31	8	You have not delivered me to the enemy; You have set my feet in the open.
15565	27	31	10	31	9	Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eyes fail from sorrow, my soul and body as well.
15566	27	31	11	31	10	For my life is consumed with grief and my years with groaning; my iniquity has drained my strength, and my bones are wasting away.
15567	27	31	12	31	11	Among all my enemies I am a disgrace, and among my neighbors even more. I am dreaded by my friends—they flee when they see me on the street.
15568	27	31	13	31	12	I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind. I am like a broken vessel.
15569	27	31	14	31	13	For I hear the slander of many; there is terror on every side. They conspire against me and plot to take my life.
15570	27	31	15	31	14	But I trust in You, O LORD; I say, “You are my God.”
15571	27	31	16	31	15	My times are in Your hands; deliver me from my enemies and from those who pursue me.
15572	27	31	17	31	16	Make Your face shine on Your servant; save me by Your loving devotion.
15573	27	31	18	31	17	O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called on You. Let the wicked be put to shame; let them lie silent in Sheol.
15574	27	31	19	31	18	May lying lips be silenced—lips that speak with arrogance against the righteous, full of pride and contempt.
15575	27	31	20	31	19	How great is Your goodness which You have laid up for those who fear You, which You have bestowed before the sons of men on those who take refuge in You.
15576	27	31	21	31	20	You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the schemes of men. You conceal them in Your shelter from accusing tongues.
15577	27	31	22	31	21	Blessed be the LORD, for He has shown me His loving devotion in a city under siege.
15578	27	31	23	31	22	In my alarm I said, “I am cut off from Your sight!” But You heard my plea for mercy when I called to You for help.
15579	27	31	24	31	23	Love the LORD, all His saints. The LORD preserves the faithful, but fully repays the arrogant.
15580	27	31	25	31	24	Be strong and courageous, all you who hope in the LORD.
15581	27	32	1	32	1	Of David. A Maskil. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
15582	27	32	2	32	2	Blessed is the man whose iniquity the LORD does not count against him, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
15583	27	32	3	32	3	When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.
15584	27	32	4	32	4	For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained as in the summer heat. Selah
15585	27	32	5	32	5	Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
15586	27	32	6	32	6	Therefore let all the godly pray to You while You may be found. Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near.
15587	27	32	7	32	7	You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah
15588	27	32	8	32	8	I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will give you counsel and watch over you.
15589	27	32	9	32	9	Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding; they must be controlled with bit and bridle to make them come to you.
15590	27	32	10	32	10	Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in the LORD.
15591	27	32	11	32	11	Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
15592	27	33	1	33	1	Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones; it is fitting for the upright to praise Him.
15593	27	33	2	33	2	Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to Him with ten strings.
15594	27	33	3	33	3	Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy.
15595	27	33	4	33	4	For the word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy.
15596	27	33	5	33	5	The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His loving devotion.
15597	27	33	6	33	6	By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.
15598	27	33	7	33	7	He piles up the waters of the sea; He puts the depths into storehouses.
15599	27	33	8	33	8	Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him.
15600	27	33	9	33	9	For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.
15601	27	33	10	33	10	The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples.
15602	27	33	11	33	11	The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the purposes of His heart to all generations.
15603	27	33	12	33	12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance!
15604	27	33	13	33	13	The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.
15605	27	33	14	33	14	From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth.
15606	27	33	15	33	15	He shapes the hearts of each; He considers all their works.
15607	27	33	16	33	16	No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by his great strength.
15608	27	33	17	33	17	A horse is a vain hope for salvation; even its great strength cannot save.
15609	27	33	18	33	18	Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His loving devotion
15610	27	33	19	33	19	to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
15611	27	33	20	33	20	Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
15612	27	33	21	33	21	For our hearts rejoice in Him, since we trust in His holy name.
15613	27	33	22	33	22	May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, as we put our hope in You.
15614	27	34	1	34	0	Of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, so that the king drove him away.
15615	27	34	2	34	1	I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.
15616	27	34	3	34	2	My soul boasts in the LORD; let the oppressed hear and rejoice.
15617	27	34	4	34	3	Magnify the LORD with me; let us exalt His name together.
15618	27	34	5	34	4	I sought the LORD, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears.
15619	27	34	6	34	5	Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; their faces shall never be ashamed.
15620	27	34	7	34	6	This poor man called out, and the LORD heard him; He saved him from all his troubles.
15621	27	34	8	34	7	The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them.
15622	27	34	9	34	8	Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!
15623	27	34	10	34	9	Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing.
15624	27	34	11	34	10	Young lions go lacking and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
15625	27	34	12	34	11	Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
15626	27	34	13	34	12	Who is the man who delights in life, who desires to see good days?
15627	27	34	14	34	13	Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech.
15628	27	34	15	34	14	Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
15629	27	34	16	34	15	The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry.
15630	27	34	17	34	16	But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to sever their memory from the earth.
15631	27	34	18	34	17	The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles.
15632	27	34	19	34	18	The LORD is near to the brokenhearted; He saves the contrite in spirit.
15633	27	34	20	34	19	Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all.
15634	27	34	21	34	20	He protects all his bones; not one of them will be broken.
15635	27	34	22	34	21	Evil will slay the wicked, and the haters of the righteous will be condemned.
15636	27	34	23	34	22	The LORD redeems His servants, and none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
15637	27	35	1	35	1	Of David. Contend with my opponents, O LORD; fight against those who fight against me.
15638	27	35	2	35	2	Take up Your shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.
15639	27	35	3	35	3	Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers; say to my soul: “I am your salvation.”
15640	27	35	4	35	4	May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plan to harm me be driven back and confounded.
15641	27	35	5	35	5	May they be like chaff in the wind, as the angel of the LORD drives them away.
15642	27	35	6	35	6	May their path be dark and slick, as the angel of the LORD pursues.
15643	27	35	7	35	7	For without cause they laid their net for me; without reason they dug a pit for my soul.
15644	27	35	8	35	8	May ruin befall them by surprise; may the net they hid ensnare them; may they fall into their own destruction.
15645	27	35	9	35	9	Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and exult in His salvation.
15646	27	35	10	35	10	All my bones will exclaim, “Who is like You, O LORD, who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor, the poor and needy from the robber?”
15647	27	35	11	35	11	Hostile witnesses come forward; they make charges I know nothing about.
15648	27	35	12	35	12	They repay me evil for good, to the bereavement of my soul.
15649	27	35	13	35	13	Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth; I humbled myself with fasting, but my prayers returned unanswered.
15650	27	35	14	35	14	I paced about as for my friend or brother; I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning for his mother.
15651	27	35	15	35	15	But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee; they gathered together against me. Assailants I did not know slandered me without ceasing.
15652	27	35	16	35	16	Like godless jesters at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.
15653	27	35	17	35	17	How long, O Lord, will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.
15654	27	35	18	35	18	Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among many people.
15655	27	35	19	35	19	Let not my enemies gloat over me without cause, nor those who hate me without reason wink in malice.
15656	27	35	20	35	20	For they do not speak peace, but they devise deceitful schemes against those who live quietly in the land.
15657	27	35	21	35	21	They gape at me and say, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!”
15658	27	35	22	35	22	O LORD, You have seen it; do not be silent. O Lord, be not far from me.
15659	27	35	23	35	23	Awake and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord!
15660	27	35	24	35	24	Vindicate me by Your righteousness, O LORD my God, and do not let them gloat over me.
15661	27	35	25	35	25	Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha, just what we wanted!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up!”
15662	27	35	26	35	26	May those who gloat in my distress be ashamed and confounded; may those who exalt themselves over me be clothed in shame and reproach.
15663	27	35	27	35	27	May those who favor my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “Exalted be the LORD who delights in His servant’s well-being.”
15664	27	35	28	35	28	Then my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness and Your praises all day long.
15665	27	36	1	36	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.
15666	27	36	2	36	1	An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
15667	27	36	3	36	2	For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin.
15668	27	36	4	36	3	The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.
15669	27	36	5	36	4	Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he fails to reject evil.
15670	27	36	6	36	5	Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.
15671	27	36	7	36	6	Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments are like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.
15672	27	36	8	36	7	How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
15673	27	36	9	36	8	They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights.
15674	27	36	10	36	9	For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.
15675	27	36	11	36	10	Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
15676	27	36	12	36	11	Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
15677	27	36	13	36	12	There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.
15678	27	37	1	37	1	Of David. Do not fret over doers of evil; do not envy those who do wrong.
15679	27	37	2	37	2	For they wither quickly like grass and wilt like tender plants.
15680	27	37	3	37	3	Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
15681	27	37	4	37	4	Delight yourself in the LORD, and He will give you the desires of your heart.
15682	27	37	5	37	5	Commit your way to the LORD; trust in Him, and He will do it.
15683	27	37	6	37	6	He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn, your justice like the noonday sun.
15684	27	37	7	37	7	Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him; fret not when men prosper in their ways, when they carry out wicked schemes.
15685	27	37	8	37	8	Refrain from anger and abandon wrath; do not fret—it can only bring harm.
15686	27	37	9	37	9	For the evildoers will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.
15687	27	37	10	37	10	Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.
15688	27	37	11	37	11	But the meek will inherit the land and delight in abundant prosperity.
15689	27	37	12	37	12	The wicked scheme against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them,
15690	27	37	13	37	13	but the Lord laughs, seeing that their day is coming.
15691	27	37	14	37	14	The wicked have drawn the sword and bent the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.
15692	27	37	15	37	15	But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
15693	27	37	16	37	16	Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many who are wicked.
15694	27	37	17	37	17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
15695	27	37	18	37	18	The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will last forever.
15696	27	37	19	37	19	In the time of evil they will not be ashamed, and in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
15697	27	37	20	37	20	But the wicked and enemies of the LORD will perish like the glory of the fields. They will vanish; like smoke they will fade away.
15698	27	37	21	37	21	The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous are gracious and giving.
15699	27	37	22	37	22	Surely those He blesses will inherit the land, but the cursed will be destroyed.
15700	27	37	23	37	23	The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD who takes delight in his journey.
15701	27	37	24	37	24	Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, for the LORD is holding his hand.
15702	27	37	25	37	25	I once was young and now am old, yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned or their children begging for bread.
15703	27	37	26	37	26	They are ever generous and quick to lend, and their children are a blessing.
15704	27	37	27	37	27	Turn away from evil and do good, so that you will abide forever.
15705	27	37	28	37	28	For the LORD loves justice and will not forsake His saints. They are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.
15706	27	37	29	37	29	The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
15707	27	37	30	37	30	The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.
15708	27	37	31	37	31	The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter.
15709	27	37	32	37	32	Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous, and seek to slay them,
15710	27	37	33	37	33	the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned under judgment.
15711	27	37	34	37	34	Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will raise you up to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
15712	27	37	35	37	35	I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a well-rooted native tree,
15713	27	37	36	37	36	yet he passed away and was no more; though I searched, he could not be found.
15714	27	37	37	37	37	Consider the blameless and observe the upright, for posterity awaits the man of peace.
15715	27	37	38	37	38	But the transgressors will all be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.
15716	27	37	39	37	39	The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their stronghold in time of trouble.
15717	27	37	40	37	40	The LORD helps and delivers them; He rescues and saves them from the wicked, because they take refuge in Him.
15718	27	38	1	38	0	A Psalm of David, for remembrance.
15719	27	38	2	38	1	O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.
15720	27	38	3	38	2	For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me.
15721	27	38	4	38	3	There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger; there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.
15722	27	38	5	38	4	For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.
15723	27	38	6	38	5	My wounds are foul and festering because of my sinful folly.
15724	27	38	7	38	6	I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.
15725	27	38	8	38	7	For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body.
15726	27	38	9	38	8	I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.
15727	27	38	10	38	9	O Lord, my every desire is before You; my groaning is not hidden from You.
15728	27	38	11	38	10	My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded.
15729	27	38	12	38	11	My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance.
15730	27	38	13	38	12	Those who seek my life lay snares; those who wish me harm speak destruction, plotting deceit all day long.
15731	27	38	14	38	13	But like a deaf man, I do not hear; and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth.
15732	27	38	15	38	14	I am like a man who cannot hear, whose mouth offers no reply.
15733	27	38	16	38	15	I wait for You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God.
15734	27	38	17	38	16	For I said, “Let them not gloat over me—those who taunt me when my foot slips.”
15735	27	38	18	38	17	For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
15736	27	38	19	38	18	Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
15737	27	38	20	38	19	Many are my enemies without cause, and many hate me without reason.
15738	27	38	21	38	20	Those who repay my good with evil attack me for pursuing the good.
15739	27	38	22	38	21	Do not forsake me, O LORD; be not far from me, O my God.
15740	27	38	23	38	22	Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.
15741	27	39	1	39	0	For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
15742	27	39	2	39	1	I said, “I will watch my ways so that I will not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are present.”
15743	27	39	3	39	2	I was speechless and still; I remained silent, even from speaking good, and my sorrow was stirred.
15744	27	39	4	39	3	My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:
15745	27	39	5	39	4	“Show me, O LORD, my end and the measure of my days. Let me know how fleeting my life is.
15746	27	39	6	39	5	You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths, and my lifetime as nothing before You. Truly each man at his best exists as but a breath. Selah
15747	27	39	7	39	6	Surely every man goes about like a phantom; surely he bustles in vain; he heaps up riches not knowing who will haul them away.
15748	27	39	8	39	7	And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.
15749	27	39	9	39	8	Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the reproach of fools.
15750	27	39	10	39	9	I have become mute; I do not open my mouth because of what You have done.
15751	27	39	11	39	10	Remove Your scourge from me; I am perishing by the force of Your hand.
15752	27	39	12	39	11	You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity, consuming like a moth what he holds dear; surely each man is but a vapor. Selah
15753	27	39	13	39	12	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. For I am a foreigner dwelling with You, a stranger like all my fathers.
15754	27	39	14	39	13	Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may again be cheered before I depart and am no more.”
15755	27	40	1	40	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
15756	27	40	2	40	1	I waited patiently for the LORD; He inclined to me and heard my cry.
15757	27	40	3	40	2	He lifted me up from the pit of despair, out of the miry clay; He set my feet upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.
15758	27	40	4	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.
15759	27	40	5	40	4	Blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, who has not turned to the proud, nor to those who lapse into falsehood.
15760	27	40	6	40	5	Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders You have done, and the plans You have for us—none can compare to You—if I proclaim and declare them, they are more than I can count.
15761	27	40	7	40	6	Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened. Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.
15762	27	40	8	40	7	Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—it is written about me in the scroll:
15763	27	40	9	40	8	I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your law is within my heart.”
15764	27	40	10	40	9	I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; behold, I do not seal my lips, as You, O LORD, do know.
15765	27	40	11	40	10	I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation; I have not concealed Your loving devotion and faithfulness from the great assembly.
15766	27	40	12	40	11	O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me; Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me.
15767	27	40	13	40	12	For evils without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed within me.
15768	27	40	14	40	13	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; hurry, O LORD, to help me.
15769	27	40	15	40	14	May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.
15770	27	40	16	40	15	May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” be appalled at their own shame.
15771	27	40	17	40	16	May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “The LORD be magnified!”
15772	27	40	18	40	17	But I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my helper and deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
15773	27	41	1	41	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
15774	27	41	2	41	1	Blessed is he who cares for the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.
15775	27	41	3	41	2	The LORD will protect and preserve him; He will bless him in the land and refuse to surrender him to the will of his foes.
15776	27	41	4	41	3	The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness and restore him from his bed of sickness.
15777	27	41	5	41	4	I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.”
15778	27	41	6	41	5	My enemies say with malice: “When will he die and be forgotten?”
15779	27	41	7	41	6	My visitor speaks falsehood; he gathers slander in his heart; he goes out and spreads it abroad.
15780	27	41	8	41	7	All who hate me whisper against me; they imagine the worst for me:
15781	27	41	9	41	8	“A vile disease has been poured into him; he will never get up from where he lies!”
15782	27	41	10	41	9	Even my close friend whom I trusted, the one who shared my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
15783	27	41	11	41	10	But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.
15784	27	41	12	41	11	By this I know that You delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
15785	27	41	13	41	12	In my integrity You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever.
15786	27	41	14	41	13	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
15787	27	42	1	42	0	For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
15788	27	42	2	42	1	As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul longs after You, O God.
15789	27	42	3	42	2	My soul thirsts for God, the living God. When shall I come and appear in God’s presence?
15790	27	42	4	42	3	My tears have been my food both day and night, while men ask me all day long, “Where is your God?”
15791	27	42	5	42	4	These things come to mind as I pour out my soul: how I walked with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and praise.
15792	27	42	6	42	5	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.
15793	27	42	7	42	6	O my God, my soul despairs within me. Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon—even from Mount Mizar.
15794	27	42	8	42	7	Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and waves have rolled over me.
15795	27	42	9	42	8	The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day, and at night His song is with me as a prayer to the God of my life.
15796	27	42	10	42	9	I say to God my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?”
15797	27	42	11	42	10	Like the crushing of my bones, my enemies taunt me, while they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
15798	27	42	12	42	11	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
15799	27	43	1	43	1	Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; deliver me from deceitful and unjust men.
15800	27	43	2	43	2	For You are the God of my refuge. Why have You rejected me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?
15801	27	43	3	43	3	Send out Your light and Your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to Your holy mountain, and to the place where You dwell.
15802	27	43	4	43	4	Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise You with the harp, O God, my God.
15803	27	43	5	43	5	Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.

15805	27	44	2	44	1	We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their days, in the days of old.
15806	27	44	3	44	2	With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our fathers there; You crushed the peoples and cast them out.
15807	27	44	4	44	3	For it was not by their sword that they took the land; their arm did not bring them victory. It was by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.
15808	27	44	5	44	4	You are my King, O God, who ordains victories for Jacob.
15809	27	44	6	44	5	Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.
15810	27	44	7	44	6	For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me.
15811	27	44	8	44	7	For You save us from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame.
15812	27	44	9	44	8	In God we have boasted all day long, and Your name we will praise forever. Selah
15813	27	44	10	44	9	But You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go forth with our armies.
15814	27	44	11	44	10	You have made us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have plundered us.
15815	27	44	12	44	11	You have given us up as sheep to be devoured; You have scattered us among the nations.
15816	27	44	13	44	12	You sell Your people for nothing; no profit do You gain from their sale.
15817	27	44	14	44	13	You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us.
15818	27	44	15	44	14	You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
15819	27	44	16	44	15	All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face,
15820	27	44	17	44	16	at the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy, bent on revenge.
15821	27	44	18	44	17	All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.
15822	27	44	19	44	18	Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.
15823	27	44	20	44	19	But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals; You have covered us with deepest darkness.
15824	27	44	21	44	20	If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
15825	27	44	22	44	21	would not God have discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart?
15826	27	44	23	44	22	Yet for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
15827	27	44	24	44	23	Wake up, O Lord! Why are You sleeping? Arise! Do not reject us forever.
15828	27	44	25	44	24	Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and oppression?
15829	27	44	26	44	25	For our soul has sunk to the dust; our bodies cling to the earth.
15830	27	44	27	44	26	Rise up; be our help! Redeem us on account of Your loving devotion.

15832	27	45	2	45	1	My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
15833	27	45	3	45	2	You are the most handsome of men; grace has anointed your lips, since God has blessed you forever.
15834	27	45	4	45	3	Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior; appear in your majesty and splendor.
15835	27	45	5	45	4	In your splendor ride forth in victory on behalf of truth and humility and justice; may your right hand show your awesome deeds.
15836	27	45	6	45	5	Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s foes; the nations fall beneath your feet.
15837	27	45	7	45	6	Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever, and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.
15838	27	45	8	45	7	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you above your companions with the oil of joy.
15839	27	45	9	45	8	All your garments are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces of ivory the harps make you glad.
15840	27	45	10	45	9	The daughters of kings are among your honored women; the queen stands at your right hand, adorned with the gold of Ophir.
15841	27	45	11	45	10	Listen, O daughter! Consider and incline your ear: Forget your people and your father’s house,
15842	27	45	12	45	11	and the king will desire your beauty; bow to him, for he is your lord.
15843	27	45	13	45	12	The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; men of wealth will seek your favor.
15844	27	45	14	45	13	All glorious is the princess in her chamber; her gown is embroidered with gold.
15845	27	45	15	45	14	In colorful garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions are brought before you.
15846	27	45	16	45	15	They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king.
15847	27	45	17	45	16	Your sons will succeed your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.
15848	27	45	18	45	17	I will commemorate your name through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you forever and ever.

15850	27	46	2	46	1	God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.
15851	27	46	3	46	2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth is transformed and the mountains are toppled into the depths of the seas,
15852	27	46	4	46	3	though their waters roar and foam and the mountains quake in the surge. Selah
15853	27	46	5	46	4	There is a river whose streams delight the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
15854	27	46	6	46	5	God is within her; she will not be moved. God will help her when morning dawns.
15855	27	46	7	46	6	Nations rage, kingdoms crumble; the earth melts when He lifts His voice.
15856	27	46	8	46	7	The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
15857	27	46	9	46	8	Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation upon the earth.
15858	27	46	10	46	9	He makes wars to cease throughout the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the shields in the fire.
15859	27	46	11	46	10	“Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted over the earth.”

15862	27	47	2	47	1	Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout unto God with a voice of triumph.
15863	27	47	3	47	2	How awesome is the LORD Most High, the great King over all the earth!
15864	27	47	4	47	3	He subdues nations beneath us, and peoples under our feet.
15865	27	47	5	47	4	He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah
15866	27	47	6	47	5	God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD with the sound of the horn.
15867	27	47	7	47	6	Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises!
15868	27	47	8	47	7	For God is King of all the earth; sing profound praises to Him.
15869	27	47	9	47	8	God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.
15870	27	47	10	47	9	The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.

15872	27	48	2	48	1	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain.
15873	27	48	3	48	2	Beautiful in loftiness, the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the great King.
15874	27	48	4	48	3	God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself to be a fortress.
15875	27	48	5	48	4	For behold, the kings assembled; they all advanced together.
15876	27	48	6	48	5	They saw and were astounded; they fled in terror.
15877	27	48	7	48	6	Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor.
15878	27	48	8	48	7	With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish.
15879	27	48	9	48	8	As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah
15880	27	48	10	48	9	Within Your temple, O God, we contemplate Your loving devotion.
15881	27	48	11	48	10	Your name, O God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.
15882	27	48	12	48	11	Mount Zion is glad, the daughters of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments.
15883	27	48	13	48	12	March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers,
15884	27	48	14	48	13	consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation.
15885	27	48	15	48	14	For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even till death.
15886	27	49	1	49	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
15887	27	49	2	49	1	Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all inhabitants of the world,
15888	27	49	3	49	2	both low and high, rich and poor alike.
15889	27	49	4	49	3	My mouth will impart wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will bring understanding.
15890	27	49	5	49	4	I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will express my riddle with the harp:
15891	27	49	6	49	5	Why should I fear in times of trouble, when wicked usurpers surround me?
15892	27	49	7	49	6	They trust in their wealth and boast in their great riches.
15893	27	49	8	49	7	No man can possibly redeem his brother or pay his ransom to God.
15894	27	49	9	49	8	For the redemption of his soul is costly, and never can payment suffice,
15895	27	49	10	49	9	that he should live on forever and not see decay.
15896	27	49	11	49	10	For it is clear that wise men die, and the foolish and the senseless both perish and leave their wealth to others.
15897	27	49	12	49	11	Their graves are their eternal homes—their dwellings for endless generations—even though their lands were their namesakes.
15898	27	49	13	49	12	But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure; he is like the beasts that perish.
15899	27	49	14	49	13	This is the fate of the self-confident and their followers who endorse their sayings. Selah
15900	27	49	15	49	14	Like sheep they are destined for Sheol. Death will be their shepherd. The upright will rule them in the morning, and their form will decay in Sheol, far from their lofty abode.
15901	27	49	16	49	15	But God will redeem my life from Sheol, for He will surely take me to Himself. Selah
15902	27	49	17	49	16	Do not be amazed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases.
15903	27	49	18	49	17	For when he dies, he will carry nothing away; his abundance will not follow him down.
15904	27	49	19	49	18	Though in his lifetime he blesses his soul—and men praise you when you prosper—
15905	27	49	20	49	19	he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light of day.
15906	27	49	21	49	20	A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
15907	27	50	1	50	1	A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.
15908	27	50	2	50	2	From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
15909	27	50	3	50	3	Our God approaches and will not be silent! Consuming fire precedes Him, and a tempest rages around Him.
15910	27	50	4	50	4	He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that He may judge His people:
15911	27	50	5	50	5	“Gather to Me My saints, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”
15912	27	50	6	50	6	And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah
15913	27	50	7	50	7	“Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.
15914	27	50	8	50	8	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are ever before Me.
15915	27	50	9	50	9	I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens,
15916	27	50	10	50	10	for every beast of the forest is Mine—the cattle on a thousand hills.
15917	27	50	11	50	11	I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.
15918	27	50	12	50	12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.
15919	27	50	13	50	13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
15920	27	50	14	50	14	Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.
15921	27	50	15	50	15	Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me.”
15922	27	50	16	50	16	To the wicked, however, God says, “What right have you to recite My statutes and to bear My covenant on your lips?
15923	27	50	17	50	17	For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you.
15924	27	50	18	50	18	When you see a thief, you befriend him, and throw in your lot with adulterers.
15925	27	50	19	50	19	You unleash your mouth for evil and unharness your tongue for deceit.
15926	27	50	20	50	20	You sit and malign your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.
15927	27	50	21	50	21	You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But now I rebuke you and accuse you to your face.
15928	27	50	22	50	22	Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:
15929	27	50	23	50	23	He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and to him who rights his way, I will show the salvation of God.”

15931	27	51	2	51	0,5	When Nathan the prophet came to him after his adultery with Bathsheba.
15932	27	51	3	51	1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving devotion; according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
15933	27	51	4	51	2	Wash me clean of my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
15934	27	51	5	51	3	For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
15935	27	51	6	51	4	Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be proved right when You speak and blameless when You judge.
15936	27	51	7	51	5	Surely I was brought forth in iniquity; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
15937	27	51	8	51	6	Surely You desire truth in the inmost being; You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
15938	27	51	9	51	7	Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
15939	27	51	10	51	8	Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
15940	27	51	11	51	9	Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
15941	27	51	12	51	10	Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
15942	27	51	13	51	11	Cast me not away from Your presence; take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
15943	27	51	14	51	12	Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.
15944	27	51	15	51	13	Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.
15945	27	51	16	51	14	Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
15946	27	51	17	51	15	O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
15947	27	51	18	51	16	For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
15948	27	51	19	51	17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
15949	27	51	20	51	18	In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
15950	27	51	21	51	19	Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.

15953	27	52	3	52	1	Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The loving devotion of God endures all day long.
15954	27	52	4	52	2	Your tongue devises destruction like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit.
15955	27	52	5	52	3	You love evil more than good, falsehood more than speaking truth. Selah
15956	27	52	6	52	4	You love every word that devours, O deceitful tongue.
15957	27	52	7	52	5	Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
15958	27	52	8	52	6	The righteous will see and fear; they will mock the evildoer, saying,
15959	27	52	9	52	7	“Look at the man who did not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his wealth and strengthened himself by destruction.”
15960	27	52	10	52	8	But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in the loving devotion of God forever and ever.
15961	27	52	11	52	9	I will praise You forever, because You have done it. I will wait on Your name—for it is good—in the presence of Your saints.

15963	27	53	2	53	1	The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their ways are vile. There is no one who does good.
15964	27	53	3	53	2	God looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.
15965	27	53	4	53	3	All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
15966	27	53	5	53	4	Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.
15967	27	53	6	53	5	There they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to fear. For God has scattered the bones of those who besieged you. You put them to shame, for God has despised them.
15968	27	53	7	53	6	Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

15974	27	54	6	54	4	Surely God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my soul.
15975	27	54	7	54	5	He will reward my enemies with evil. In Your faithfulness, destroy them.
15976	27	54	8	54	6	Freely I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good.

15979	27	55	2	55	1	Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea.
15980	27	55	3	55	2	Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught
15981	27	55	4	55	3	at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they release disaster upon me and revile me in their anger.
15982	27	55	5	55	4	My heart murmurs within me, and the terrors of death assail me.
15983	27	55	6	55	5	Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
15984	27	55	7	55	6	I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
15985	27	55	8	55	7	How far away I would flee; in the wilderness I would remain. Selah
15986	27	55	9	55	8	I would hurry to my shelter, far from this raging tempest.”
15987	27	55	10	55	9	O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.
15988	27	55	11	55	10	Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within.
15989	27	55	12	55	11	Destruction is in the midst; oppression and deceit never leave the streets.
15990	27	55	13	55	12	For it is not an enemy who insults me; that I could endure. It is not a foe who rises against me; from him I could hide.
15991	27	55	14	55	13	But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.
15992	27	55	15	55	14	We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
15993	27	55	16	55	15	Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes.
15994	27	55	17	55	16	But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.
15995	27	55	18	55	17	Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.
15996	27	55	19	55	18	He redeems my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
15997	27	55	20	55	19	God will hear and humiliate them—the One enthroned for the ages—Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God.
15998	27	55	21	55	20	My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.
15999	27	55	22	55	21	His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed.
16000	27	55	23	55	22	Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.
16001	27	55	24	55	23	But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
16002	27	56	1	56	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. 
16003	27	56	2	56	1	Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day they press their attack.
16004	27	56	3	56	2	My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me.
16005	27	56	4	56	3	When I am afraid, I put my trust in You.
16006	27	56	5	56	4	In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
16007	27	56	6	56	5	All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are on my demise.
16008	27	56	7	56	6	They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.
16009	27	56	8	56	7	In spite of such sin, will they escape? In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations.
16010	27	56	9	56	8	You have taken account of my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle—are they not in Your book?
16011	27	56	10	56	9	Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side.
16012	27	56	11	56	10	In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
16013	27	56	12	56	11	in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
16014	27	56	13	56	12	Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.
16015	27	56	14	56	13	For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
16016	27	57	1	57	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul into the cave. 
16017	27	57	2	57	1	Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed.
16018	27	57	3	57	2	I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me.
16019	27	57	4	57	3	He reaches down from heaven and saves me; He rebukes those who trample me. Selah God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth.
16020	27	57	5	57	4	My soul is among the lions; I lie down with ravenous beasts—with men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
16021	27	57	6	57	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.
16022	27	57	7	57	6	They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit before me, but they themselves have fallen into it! Selah
16023	27	57	8	57	7	My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music.
16024	27	57	9	57	8	Awake, O glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
16025	27	57	10	57	9	I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.
16026	27	57	11	57	10	For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.
16027	27	57	12	57	11	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.
16028	27	58	1	58	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David. 
16029	27	58	2	58	1	Do you indeed speak justly, O rulers? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men?
16030	27	58	3	58	2	No, in your hearts you devise injustice; with your hands you mete out violence on the earth.
16031	27	58	4	58	3	The wicked are estranged from the womb; the liars go astray from birth.
16032	27	58	5	58	4	Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like a cobra that shuts its ears,
16033	27	58	6	58	5	refusing to hear the tune of the charmer who skillfully weaves his spell.
16034	27	58	7	58	6	O God, shatter their teeth in their mouths; O LORD, tear out the fangs of the lions.
16035	27	58	8	58	7	May they vanish like water that runs off; when they draw the bow, may their arrows be blunted.
16036	27	58	9	58	8	Like a slug that dissolves in its slime, like a woman’s stillborn child, may they never see the sun.
16037	27	58	10	58	9	Before your pots can feel the burning thorns—whether green or dry—He will sweep them away.
16038	27	58	11	58	10	The righteous will rejoice when they see they are avenged; they will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
16039	27	58	12	58	11	Then men will say, “There is surely a reward for the righteous! There is surely a God who judges the earth!”
16040	27	59	1	59	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him. 
16041	27	59	2	59	1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.
16042	27	59	3	59	2	Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed.
16043	27	59	4	59	3	See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD.
16044	27	59	5	59	4	For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice.
16045	27	59	6	59	5	O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah
16046	27	59	7	59	6	They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
16047	27	59	8	59	7	See what they spew from their mouths—sharp words from their lips: “For who can hear us?”
16048	27	59	9	59	8	But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.
16049	27	59	10	59	9	I will keep watch for You, O my strength; for You, O God, are my fortress.
16050	27	59	11	59	10	My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes.
16051	27	59	12	59	11	Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
16052	27	59	13	59	12	By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter.
16053	27	59	14	59	13	Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
16054	27	59	15	59	14	They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
16055	27	59	16	59	15	They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.
16056	27	59	17	59	16	But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
16057	27	59	18	59	17	To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.

16059	27	60	2	60	0,5	When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
16060	27	60	3	60	1	You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!
16061	27	60	4	60	2	You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking.
16062	27	60	5	60	3	You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.
16063	27	60	6	60	4	You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow. Selah
16064	27	60	7	60	5	Respond and save us with Your right hand, that those You love may be delivered.
16065	27	60	8	60	6	God has spoken from His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.
16066	27	60	9	60	7	Gilead is Mine and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet and Judah is My scepter.
16067	27	60	10	60	8	Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
16068	27	60	11	60	9	Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
16069	27	60	12	60	10	Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You not march out with our armies?
16070	27	60	13	60	11	Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.
16071	27	60	14	60	12	With God we will perform with valor; He will trample our enemies.

16073	27	61	2	61	1	Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.
16074	27	61	3	61	2	From the ends of the earth I call out to You whenever my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
16075	27	61	4	61	3	For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy.
16076	27	61	5	61	4	Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah
16077	27	61	6	61	5	For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.
16078	27	61	7	61	6	Increase the days of the king’s life; may his years span many generations.
16079	27	61	8	61	7	May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him.
16080	27	61	9	61	8	Then I will ever sing praise to Your name and fulfill my vows day by day.
16081	27	62	1	62	0	For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
16082	27	62	2	62	1	In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.
16083	27	62	3	62	2	He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress; I will never be shaken.
16084	27	62	4	62	3	How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?
16085	27	62	5	62	4	They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch; they delight in lies; with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah
16086	27	62	6	62	5	Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
16087	27	62	7	62	6	He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress; I will not be shaken.
16088	27	62	8	62	7	My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock; my refuge is in God.
16089	27	62	9	62	8	Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah
16090	27	62	10	62	9	Lowborn men are but a vapor, the exalted but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they go up; together they are but a vapor.
16091	27	62	11	62	10	Place no trust in extortion, or false hope in stolen goods. If your riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.
16092	27	62	12	62	11	God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God,
16093	27	62	13	62	12	and loving devotion to You, O Lord. For You will repay each man according to his deeds.
16094	27	63	1	63	0	A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.
16095	27	63	2	63	1	O God, You are my God. Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You. My body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.
16096	27	63	3	63	2	So I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and glory.
16097	27	63	4	63	3	Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.
16098	27	63	5	63	4	So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.
16099	27	63	6	63	5	My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.
16100	27	63	7	63	6	When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.
16101	27	63	8	63	7	For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.
16102	27	63	9	63	8	My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.
16103	27	63	10	63	9	But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.
16104	27	63	11	63	10	They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become a portion for foxes.
16105	27	63	12	63	11	But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
16106	27	64	1	64	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. 
16107	27	64	2	64	1	Hear, O God, my voice of complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
16108	27	64	3	64	2	Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of workers of iniquity,
16109	27	64	4	64	3	who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows,
16110	27	64	5	64	4	ambushing the innocent in seclusion, shooting suddenly, without fear.
16111	27	64	6	64	5	They hold fast to their evil purpose; they speak of hiding their snares. “Who will see them?” they say.
16112	27	64	7	64	6	They devise injustice and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” For the inner man and the heart are mysterious.
16113	27	64	8	64	7	But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be wounded.
16114	27	64	9	64	8	They will be made to stumble, their own tongues turned against them. All who see will shake their heads.
16115	27	64	10	64	9	Then all mankind will fear and proclaim the work of God; so they will ponder what He has done.
16116	27	64	11	64	10	Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; let all the upright in heart exult.

16120	27	65	4	65	3	When iniquities prevail against me, You atone for our transgressions.
16121	27	65	5	65	4	Blessed is the one You choose and bring near to dwell in Your courts! We are filled with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.
16122	27	65	6	65	5	With awesome deeds of righteousness You answer us, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.
16123	27	65	7	65	6	You formed the mountains by Your power, having girded Yourself with might.
16124	27	65	8	65	7	You stilled the roaring of the seas, the pounding of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.
16125	27	65	9	65	8	Those who live far away fear Your wonders; You make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.
16126	27	65	10	65	9	You attend to the earth and water it; with abundance You enrich it. The streams of God are full of water, for You prepare our grain by providing for the earth.
16127	27	65	11	65	10	You soak its furrows and level its ridges; You soften it with showers and bless its growth.
16128	27	65	12	65	11	You crown the year with Your bounty, and Your paths overflow with plenty.
16129	27	65	13	65	12	The pastures of the wilderness overflow; the hills are robed with joy.
16130	27	65	14	65	13	The pastures are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are decked with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
16131	27	66	1	66	1	For the choirmaster. A song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth!
16132	27	66	2	66	2	Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.
16133	27	66	3	66	3	Say to God, “How awesome are Your deeds! So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You.
16134	27	66	4	66	4	All the earth bows down to You; they sing praise to You; they sing praise to Your name.” Selah
16135	27	66	5	66	5	Come and see the works of God; how awesome are His deeds toward mankind.
16136	27	66	6	66	6	He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the waters on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.
16137	27	66	7	66	7	He rules forever by His power; His eyes watch the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
16138	27	66	8	66	8	Praise our God, O peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.
16139	27	66	9	66	9	He preserves our lives and keeps our feet from slipping.
16140	27	66	10	66	10	For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us like silver.
16141	27	66	11	66	11	You led us into the net; You laid burdens on our backs.
16142	27	66	12	66	12	You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us into abundance.
16143	27	66	13	66	13	I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You—
16144	27	66	14	66	14	the vows that my lips promised and my mouth spoke in my distress.
16145	27	66	15	66	15	I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah
16146	27	66	16	66	16	Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for me.
16147	27	66	17	66	17	I cried out to Him with my mouth and praised Him with my tongue.
16148	27	66	18	66	18	If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
16149	27	66	19	66	19	But God has surely heard; He has attended to the sound of my prayer.
16150	27	66	20	66	20	Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld from me His loving devotion!

16156	27	67	6	67	5	Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.
16157	27	67	7	67	6	The earth has yielded its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.

16159	27	68	1	68	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song. 
16160	27	68	2	68	1	God arises. His enemies are scattered, and those who hate Him flee His presence.
16161	27	68	3	68	2	As smoke is blown away, You will drive them out; as wax melts before the fire, the wicked will perish in the presence of God.
16162	27	68	4	68	3	But the righteous will be glad and rejoice before God; they will celebrate with joy.
16163	27	68	5	68	4	Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds—His name is the LORD—and rejoice before Him.
16164	27	68	6	68	5	A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, is God in His holy habitation.
16165	27	68	7	68	6	God settles the lonely in families; He leads the prisoners out to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
16166	27	68	8	68	7	O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wasteland, Selah
16167	27	68	9	68	8	the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain before God, the One on Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
16168	27	68	10	68	9	You sent abundant rain, O God; You refreshed Your weary inheritance.
16169	27	68	11	68	10	Your flock settled therein; O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor.
16170	27	68	12	68	11	The Lord gives the command; a great company of women proclaim it:
16171	27	68	13	68	12	“Kings and their armies flee in haste; she who waits at home divides the plunder.
16172	27	68	14	68	13	Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her feathers with shimmering gold.”
16173	27	68	15	68	14	When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like the snow falling on Zalmon.
16174	27	68	16	68	15	A mountain of God is Mount Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is Mount Bashan.
16175	27	68	17	68	16	Why do you gaze in envy, O mountains of many peaks? This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling, where the LORD will surely dwell forever.
16176	27	68	18	68	17	The chariots of God are tens of thousands—thousands of thousands are they; the Lord is in His sanctuary as He was at Sinai.
16177	27	68	19	68	18	You have ascended on high; You have led captives away. You have received gifts from men, even from the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there.
16178	27	68	20	68	19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, the God of our salvation. Selah
16179	27	68	21	68	20	Our God is a God of deliverance; the Lord GOD is our rescuer from death.
16180	27	68	22	68	21	Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy crowns of those who persist in guilty ways.
16181	27	68	23	68	22	The Lord said, “I will retrieve them from Bashan, I will bring them up from the depths of the sea,
16182	27	68	24	68	23	that your foot may be dipped in the blood of your foes—the tongues of your dogs in the same.”
16183	27	68	25	68	24	They have seen Your procession, O God—the march of my God and King into the sanctuary.
16184	27	68	26	68	25	The singers lead the way, the musicians follow after, among the maidens playing tambourines.
16185	27	68	27	68	26	Bless God in the great congregation; bless the Lord from the fountain of Israel.
16186	27	68	28	68	27	There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah in their company, the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.
16187	27	68	29	68	28	Summon Your power, O God; show Your strength, O God, which You have exerted on our behalf.
16188	27	68	30	68	29	Because of Your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring You gifts.
16189	27	68	31	68	30	Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations, until it submits, bringing bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.
16190	27	68	32	68	31	Envoys will arrive from Egypt; Cush will stretch out her hands to God.
16191	27	68	33	68	32	Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth; sing praises to the Lord—Selah
16192	27	68	34	68	33	to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old; behold, His mighty voice resounds.
16193	27	68	35	68	34	Ascribe the power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose strength is in the skies.
16194	27	68	36	68	35	O God, You are awesome in Your sanctuary; the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be God!
16195	27	69	1	69	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David. 
16196	27	69	2	69	1	Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck.
16197	27	69	3	69	2	I have sunk into the miry depths, where there is no footing; I have drifted into deep waters, where the flood engulfs me.
16198	27	69	4	69	3	I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
16199	27	69	5	69	4	Those who hate me without cause outnumber the hairs of my head; many are those who would destroy me—my enemies for no reason. Though I did not steal, I must repay.
16200	27	69	6	69	5	You know my folly, O God, and my guilt is not hidden from You.
16201	27	69	7	69	6	May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of Hosts; may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, O God of Israel.
16202	27	69	8	69	7	For I have endured scorn for Your sake, and shame has covered my face.
16203	27	69	9	69	8	I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons,
16204	27	69	10	69	9	because zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.
16205	27	69	11	69	10	I wept and fasted, but it brought me reproach.
16206	27	69	12	69	11	I made sackcloth my clothing, and I was sport to them.
16207	27	69	13	69	12	Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of drunkards.
16208	27	69	14	69	13	But my prayer to You, O LORD, is for a time of favor. In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, answer me with Your sure salvation.
16209	27	69	15	69	14	Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink; deliver me from my foes and out of the deep waters.
16210	27	69	16	69	15	Do not let the floods engulf me or the depths swallow me up; let not the Pit close its mouth over me.
16211	27	69	17	69	16	Answer me, O LORD, for Your loving devotion is good; turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion.
16212	27	69	18	69	17	Hide not Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly!
16213	27	69	19	69	18	Draw near to my soul and redeem me; ransom me because of my foes.
16214	27	69	20	69	19	You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. All my adversaries are before You.
16215	27	69	21	69	20	Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found no one.
16216	27	69	22	69	21	They poisoned my food with gall and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst.
16217	27	69	23	69	22	May their table become a snare; may it be a retribution and a trap.
16218	27	69	24	69	23	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.
16219	27	69	25	69	24	Pour out Your wrath upon them, and let Your burning anger overtake them.
16220	27	69	26	69	25	May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
16221	27	69	27	69	26	For they persecute the one You struck and recount the pain of those You wounded.
16222	27	69	28	69	27	Add iniquity to their iniquity; let them not share in Your righteousness.
16223	27	69	29	69	28	May they be blotted out of the Book of Life and not listed with the righteous.
16224	27	69	30	69	29	But I am in pain and distress; let Your salvation protect me, O God.
16225	27	69	31	69	30	I will praise God’s name in song and exalt Him with thanksgiving.
16226	27	69	32	69	31	And this will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves.
16227	27	69	33	69	32	The humble will see and rejoice. You who seek God, let your hearts be revived!
16228	27	69	34	69	33	For the LORD listens to the needy and does not despise His captive people.
16229	27	69	35	69	34	Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them.
16230	27	69	36	69	35	For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it.
16231	27	69	37	69	36	The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will settle in it.
16232	27	70	1	70	0	For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance. 
16233	27	70	2	70	1	Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Hurry, O LORD, to help me!
16234	27	70	3	70	2	May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.
16235	27	70	4	70	3	May those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame.
16236	27	70	5	70	4	May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation ever say, “Let God be magnified!”
16237	27	70	6	70	5	I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
16238	27	71	1	71	1	In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.
16239	27	71	2	71	2	In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; incline Your ear and save me.
16240	27	71	3	71	3	Be my rock of refuge, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for You are my rock and my fortress.
16241	27	71	4	71	4	Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and ruthless.
16242	27	71	5	71	5	For You are my hope, O Lord GOD, my confidence from my youth.
16243	27	71	6	71	6	I have leaned on You since birth; You pulled me from my mother’s womb. My praise is always for You.
16244	27	71	7	71	7	I have become a portent to many, but You are my strong refuge.
16245	27	71	8	71	8	My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your splendor all day long.
16246	27	71	9	71	9	Do not discard me in my old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails.
16247	27	71	10	71	10	For my enemies speak against me, and those who lie in wait for my life conspire,
16248	27	71	11	71	11	saying, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for there is no one to rescue him.”
16249	27	71	12	71	12	Be not far from me, O God. Hurry, O my God, to help me.
16250	27	71	13	71	13	May the accusers of my soul be ashamed and consumed; may those who seek my harm be covered with scorn and disgrace.
16251	27	71	14	71	14	But I will always hope and will praise You more and more.
16252	27	71	15	71	15	My mouth will declare Your righteousness and Your salvation all day long, though I cannot know their full measure.
16253	27	71	16	71	16	I will enter in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will proclaim Your righteousness—Yours alone.
16254	27	71	17	71	17	O God, You have taught me from my youth, and to this day I proclaim Your marvelous deeds.
16255	27	71	18	71	18	Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, until I proclaim Your power to the next generation, Your might to all who are to come.
16256	27	71	19	71	19	Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God, You who have done great things. Who, O God, is like You?
16257	27	71	20	71	20	Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes, You will revive me once again. Even from the depths of the earth You will bring me back up.
16258	27	71	21	71	21	You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.
16259	27	71	22	71	22	So I will praise You with the harp for Your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to You with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
16260	27	71	23	71	23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to You, along with my soul, which You have redeemed.
16261	27	71	24	71	24	My tongue will indeed proclaim Your righteousness all day long, for those who seek my harm are disgraced and confounded.
16262	27	72	1	72	1	Of Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness.
16263	27	72	2	72	2	May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.
16264	27	72	3	72	3	May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring righteousness.
16265	27	72	4	72	4	May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.
16266	27	72	5	72	5	May they fear him as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations.
16267	27	72	6	72	6	May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.
16268	27	72	7	72	7	May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more.
16269	27	72	8	72	8	May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
16270	27	72	9	72	9	May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust.
16271	27	72	10	72	10	May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
16272	27	72	11	72	11	May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.
16273	27	72	12	72	12	For he will deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.
16274	27	72	13	72	13	He will take pity on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed.
16275	27	72	14	72	14	He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight.
16276	27	72	15	72	15	Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long.
16277	27	72	16	72	16	May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, and its people like the grass of the field.
16278	27	72	17	72	17	May his name endure forever; may his name continue as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed.
16279	27	72	18	72	18	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
16280	27	72	19	72	19	And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen.
16281	27	72	20	72	20	Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.
16282	27	73	1	73	1	A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
16283	27	73	2	73	2	But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.
16284	27	73	3	73	3	For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
16285	27	73	4	73	4	They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed.
16286	27	73	5	73	5	They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.
16287	27	73	6	73	6	Therefore pride is their necklace; a garment of violence covers them.
16288	27	73	7	73	7	From their prosperity proceeds iniquity; the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
16289	27	73	8	73	8	They mock and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.
16290	27	73	9	73	9	They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues strut across the earth.
16291	27	73	10	73	10	So their people return to this place and drink up waters in abundance.
16292	27	73	11	73	11	The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?”
16293	27	73	12	73	12	Behold, these are the wicked—always carefree as they increase their wealth.
16294	27	73	13	73	13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; in innocence I have washed my hands.
16295	27	73	14	73	14	For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.
16296	27	73	15	73	15	If I had said, “I will speak this way,” then I would have betrayed Your children.
16297	27	73	16	73	16	When I tried to understand all this, it was troublesome in my sight
16298	27	73	17	73	17	until I entered God’s sanctuary; then I discerned their end.
16299	27	73	18	73	18	Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin.
16300	27	73	19	73	19	How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors!
16301	27	73	20	73	20	Like one waking from a dream, so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.
16302	27	73	21	73	21	When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within,
16303	27	73	22	73	22	I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You.
16304	27	73	23	73	23	Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.
16305	27	73	24	73	24	You guide me with Your counsel, and later receive me in glory.
16306	27	73	25	73	25	Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You.
16307	27	73	26	73	26	My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
16308	27	73	27	73	27	Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.
16309	27	73	28	73	28	But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may proclaim all Your works.
16310	27	74	1	74	1	A Maskil of Asaph. Why have You rejected us forever, O God? Why does Your anger smolder against the sheep of Your pasture?
16311	27	74	2	74	2	Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritance—Mount Zion where You dwell.
16312	27	74	3	74	3	Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.
16313	27	74	4	74	4	Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,
16314	27	74	5	74	5	like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees
16315	27	74	6	74	6	and smashing all the carved work with hatchets and picks.
16316	27	74	7	74	7	They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name.
16317	27	74	8	74	8	They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely.” They burned down every place where God met us in the land.
16318	27	74	9	74	9	There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.
16319	27	74	10	74	10	How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?
16320	27	74	11	74	11	Why do You withdraw Your strong right hand? Stretch it out to destroy them!
16321	27	74	12	74	12	Yet God is my King from ancient times, working salvation on the earth.
16322	27	74	13	74	13	You divided the sea by Your strength; You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea;
16323	27	74	14	74	14	You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.
16324	27	74	15	74	15	You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
16325	27	74	16	74	16	The day is Yours, and also the night; You established the moon and the sun.
16326	27	74	17	74	17	You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made the summer and winter.
16327	27	74	18	74	18	Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD, how a foolish people has spurned Your name.
16328	27	74	19	74	19	Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.
16329	27	74	20	74	20	Consider Your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
16330	27	74	21	74	21	Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; may the poor and needy praise Your name.
16331	27	74	22	74	22	Rise up, O God; defend Your cause! Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.
16332	27	74	23	74	23	Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually.
16333	27	75	1	75	0	For the choirmaster: To the tune of “Do not Destroy.” A Psalm of Asaph. A song. 
16334	27	75	2	75	1	We give thanks to You, O God; we give thanks, for Your Name is near. The people declare Your wondrous works.
16335	27	75	3	75	2	“When I choose a time, I will judge fairly.
16336	27	75	4	75	3	When the earth and all its dwellers quake, it is I who bear up its pillars. Selah
16337	27	75	5	75	4	I say to the proud, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn.
16338	27	75	6	75	5	Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak with an outstretched neck.’”
16339	27	75	7	75	6	For exaltation comes neither from east nor west, nor out of the desert,
16340	27	75	8	75	7	but it is God who judges; He brings down one and exalts another.
16341	27	75	9	75	8	For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours from His cup, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to the dregs.
16342	27	75	10	75	9	But I will proclaim Him forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
16343	27	75	11	75	10	“All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous will be exalted.”
16344	27	76	1	76	0	For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A song. 
16345	27	76	2	76	1	God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
16346	27	76	3	76	2	His tent is in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion.
16347	27	76	4	76	3	There He shattered the flaming arrows, the shield and sword and weapons of war. Selah
16348	27	76	5	76	4	You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains filled with game.
16349	27	76	6	76	5	The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand.
16350	27	76	7	76	6	At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.
16351	27	76	8	76	7	You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?
16352	27	76	9	76	8	From heaven You pronounced judgment, and the earth feared and was still
16353	27	76	10	76	9	when God rose up to judge, to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah
16354	27	76	11	76	10	Even the wrath of man shall praise You; with the survivors of wrath You will clothe Yourself.
16355	27	76	12	76	11	Make and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God; let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him who is to be feared.
16356	27	76	13	76	12	He breaks the spirits of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
16357	27	77	1	77	0	For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.
16358	27	77	2	77	1	I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.
16359	27	77	3	77	2	In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.
16360	27	77	4	77	3	I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah
16361	27	77	5	77	4	You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.
16362	27	77	6	77	5	I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.
16363	27	77	7	77	6	At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:
16364	27	77	8	77	7	“Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?
16365	27	77	9	77	8	Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?
16366	27	77	10	77	9	Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah
16367	27	77	11	77	10	So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
16368	27	77	12	77	11	I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.
16369	27	77	13	77	12	I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.
16370	27	77	14	77	13	Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?
16371	27	77	15	77	14	You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples.
16372	27	77	16	77	15	With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
16373	27	77	17	77	16	The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken.
16374	27	77	18	77	17	The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth.
16375	27	77	19	77	18	Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
16376	27	77	20	77	19	Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.
16377	27	77	21	77	20	You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
16378	27	78	1	78	1	A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; listen to the words of my mouth.
16379	27	78	2	78	2	I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the beginning,
16380	27	78	3	78	3	that we have heard and known and our fathers have relayed to us.
16381	27	78	4	78	4	We will not hide them from their children, but will declare to the next generation the praises of the LORD and His might, and the wonders He has performed.
16382	27	78	5	78	5	For He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children,
16383	27	78	6	78	6	that the coming generation would know them—even children yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children
16384	27	78	7	78	7	that they should put their confidence in God, not forgetting His works, but keeping His commandments.
16385	27	78	8	78	8	Then they will not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose heart was not loyal, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
16386	27	78	9	78	9	The archers of Ephraim turned back on the day of battle.
16387	27	78	10	78	10	They failed to keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.
16388	27	78	11	78	11	They forgot what He had done, the wonders He had shown them.
16389	27	78	12	78	12	He worked wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
16390	27	78	13	78	13	He split the sea and brought them through; He set the waters upright like a wall.
16391	27	78	14	78	14	He led them with a cloud by day and with a light of fire all night.
16392	27	78	15	78	15	He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.
16393	27	78	16	78	16	He brought streams from the stone and made water flow down like rivers.
16394	27	78	17	78	17	But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
16395	27	78	18	78	18	They willfully tested God by demanding the food they craved.
16396	27	78	19	78	19	They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?
16397	27	78	20	78	20	When He struck the rock, water gushed out and torrents overflowed. But can He also give bread or supply His people with meat?”
16398	27	78	21	78	21	Therefore the LORD heard and was filled with wrath; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and His anger flared against Israel,
16399	27	78	22	78	22	because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.
16400	27	78	23	78	23	Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.
16401	27	78	24	78	24	He rained down manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.
16402	27	78	25	78	25	Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance.
16403	27	78	26	78	26	He stirred the east wind from the heavens and drove the south wind by His might.
16404	27	78	27	78	27	He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
16405	27	78	28	78	28	He felled them in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
16406	27	78	29	78	29	So they ate and were well filled, for He gave them what they craved.
16407	27	78	30	78	30	Yet before they had filled their desire, with the food still in their mouths,
16408	27	78	31	78	31	God’s anger flared against them, and He put to death their strongest and subdued the young men of Israel.
16409	27	78	32	78	32	In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.
16410	27	78	33	78	33	So He ended their days in futility, and their years in sudden terror.
16411	27	78	34	78	34	When He slew them, they would seek Him; they repented and searched for God.
16412	27	78	35	78	35	And they remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
16413	27	78	36	78	36	But they deceived Him with their mouths, and lied to Him with their tongues.
16414	27	78	37	78	37	Their hearts were disloyal to Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
16415	27	78	38	78	38	Yet He was compassionate; He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. He often restrained His anger and did not unleash His full wrath.
16416	27	78	39	78	39	He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
16417	27	78	40	78	40	How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert!
16418	27	78	41	78	41	Again and again they tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
16419	27	78	42	78	42	They did not remember His power—the day He redeemed them from the adversary,
16420	27	78	43	78	43	when He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.
16421	27	78	44	78	44	He turned their rivers to blood, and from their streams they could not drink.
16422	27	78	45	78	45	He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
16423	27	78	46	78	46	He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.
16424	27	78	47	78	47	He killed their vines with hailstones and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
16425	27	78	48	78	48	He abandoned their cattle to the hail and their livestock to bolts of lightning.
16426	27	78	49	78	49	He unleashed His fury against them, wrath, indignation, and calamity—a band of destroying angels.
16427	27	78	50	78	50	He cleared a path for His anger; He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.
16428	27	78	51	78	51	He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, the virility in the tents of Ham.
16429	27	78	52	78	52	He led out His people like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
16430	27	78	53	78	53	He led them safely, so they did not fear, but the sea engulfed their enemies.
16431	27	78	54	78	54	He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had acquired.
16432	27	78	55	78	55	He drove out nations before them and apportioned their inheritance; He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
16433	27	78	56	78	56	But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, for they did not keep His decrees.
16434	27	78	57	78	57	They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, twisted like a faulty bow.
16435	27	78	58	78	58	They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their idols.
16436	27	78	59	78	59	On hearing it, God was furious and rejected Israel completely.
16437	27	78	60	78	60	He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.
16438	27	78	61	78	61	He delivered His strength to captivity, and His splendor to the hand of the adversary.
16439	27	78	62	78	62	He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged by His heritage.
16440	27	78	63	78	63	Fire consumed His young men, and their maidens were left without wedding songs.
16441	27	78	64	78	64	His priests fell by the sword, but His widows could not lament.
16442	27	78	65	78	65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.
16443	27	78	66	78	66	He beat back His foes; He put them to everlasting shame.
16444	27	78	67	78	67	He rejected the tent of Joseph and refused the tribe of Ephraim.
16445	27	78	68	78	68	But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
16446	27	78	69	78	69	He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth He has established forever.
16447	27	78	70	78	70	He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
16448	27	78	71	78	71	from tending the ewes He brought him to be shepherd of His people Jacob, of Israel His inheritance.
16449	27	78	72	78	72	So David shepherded them with integrity of heart and guided them with skillful hands.
16450	27	79	1	79	1	A Psalm of Asaph. The nations, O God, have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple and reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
16451	27	79	2	79	2	They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
16452	27	79	3	79	3	They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.
16453	27	79	4	79	4	We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.
16454	27	79	5	79	5	How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
16455	27	79	6	79	6	Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that refuse to call on Your name,
16456	27	79	7	79	7	for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
16457	27	79	8	79	8	Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come quickly, for we are brought low.
16458	27	79	9	79	9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; deliver us and atone for our sins, for the sake of Your name.
16459	27	79	10	79	10	Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.
16460	27	79	11	79	11	May the groans of the captives reach You; by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.
16461	27	79	12	79	12	Pay back into the laps of our neighbors sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord.
16462	27	79	13	79	13	Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; from generation to generation we will declare Your praise.
16463	27	80	1	80	0	For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph.
16464	27	80	2	80	1	Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth
16465	27	80	3	80	2	before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your mighty power and come to save us.
16466	27	80	4	80	3	Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
16467	27	80	5	80	4	O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?
16468	27	80	6	80	5	You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink the full measure of their tears.
16469	27	80	7	80	6	You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us.
16470	27	80	8	80	7	Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
16471	27	80	9	80	8	You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.
16472	27	80	10	80	9	You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.
16473	27	80	11	80	10	The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.
16474	27	80	12	80	11	It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.
16475	27	80	13	80	12	Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
16476	27	80	14	80	13	The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.
16477	27	80	15	80	14	Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine,
16478	27	80	16	80	15	the root Your right hand has planted, the son You have raised up for Yourself.
16479	27	80	17	80	16	Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
16480	27	80	18	80	17	Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself.
16481	27	80	19	80	18	Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.
16482	27	80	20	80	19	Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
16483	27	81	1	81	0	For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. Of Asaph.
16484	27	81	2	81	1	Sing for joy to God our strength; make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
16485	27	81	3	81	2	Lift up a song, strike the tambourine, play the sweet-sounding harp and lyre.
16486	27	81	4	81	3	Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and at the full moon on the day of our Feast.
16487	27	81	5	81	4	For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
16488	27	81	6	81	5	He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt, where I heard an unfamiliar language:
16489	27	81	7	81	6	“I relieved his shoulder of the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.
16490	27	81	8	81	7	You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the cloud of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
16491	27	81	9	81	8	Hear, O My people, and I will warn you: O Israel, if only you would listen to Me!
16492	27	81	10	81	9	There must be no strange god among you, nor shall you bow to a foreign god.
16493	27	81	11	81	10	I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it.
16494	27	81	12	81	11	But My people would not listen to Me, and Israel would not obey Me.
16495	27	81	13	81	12	So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.
16496	27	81	14	81	13	If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My ways,
16497	27	81	15	81	14	how soon I would subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes!
16498	27	81	16	81	15	Those who hate the LORD would feign obedience, and their doom would last forever.
16499	27	81	17	81	16	But I would feed you the finest wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
16500	27	82	1	82	1	A Psalm of Asaph. God presides in the divine assembly; He renders judgment among the gods:
16501	27	82	2	82	2	“How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
16502	27	82	3	82	3	Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.
16503	27	82	4	82	4	Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.
16504	27	82	5	82	5	They do not know or understand; they wander in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
16505	27	82	6	82	6	I have said, ‘You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.’
16506	27	82	7	82	7	But like mortals you will die, and like rulers you will fall.”
16507	27	82	8	82	8	Arise, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are Your inheritance.
16508	27	83	1	83	0	A song. A Psalm of Asaph.
16509	27	83	2	83	1	O God, be not silent; be not speechless; be not still, O God.
16510	27	83	3	83	2	See how Your enemies rage, how Your foes have reared their heads.
16511	27	83	4	83	3	With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish,
16512	27	83	5	83	4	saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
16513	27	83	6	83	5	For with one mind they plot together, they form an alliance against You—
16514	27	83	7	83	6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,
16515	27	83	8	83	7	of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, of Philistia with the people of Tyre.
16516	27	83	9	83	8	Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah
16517	27	83	10	83	9	Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,
16518	27	83	11	83	10	who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.
16519	27	83	12	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
16520	27	83	13	83	12	who said, “Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.”
16521	27	83	14	83	13	Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.
16522	27	83	15	83	14	As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze,
16523	27	83	16	83	15	so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.
16524	27	83	17	83	16	Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.
16525	27	83	18	83	17	May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace.
16526	27	83	19	83	18	May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
16527	27	84	1	84	0	For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
16528	27	84	2	84	1	How lovely is Your dwelling place, O LORD of Hosts.
16529	27	84	3	84	2	My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
16530	27	84	4	84	3	Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she places her young near Your altars, O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.
16531	27	84	5	84	4	How blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they are ever praising You. Selah
16532	27	84	6	84	5	Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
16533	27	84	7	84	6	As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools.
16534	27	84	8	84	7	They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion.
16535	27	84	9	84	8	O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah
16536	27	84	10	84	9	Take notice of our shield, O God, and look with favor on the face of Your anointed.
16537	27	84	11	84	10	For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.
16538	27	84	12	84	11	For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.
16539	27	84	13	84	12	O LORD of Hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in You!
16540	27	85	1	85	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
16541	27	85	2	85	1	You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity.
16542	27	85	3	85	2	You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah
16543	27	85	4	85	3	You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.
16544	27	85	5	85	4	Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us.
16545	27	85	6	85	5	Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?
16546	27	85	7	85	6	Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?
16547	27	85	8	85	7	Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.
16548	27	85	9	85	8	I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly.
16549	27	85	10	85	9	Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land.
16550	27	85	11	85	10	Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed.
16551	27	85	12	85	11	Faithfulness sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
16552	27	85	13	85	12	The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase.
16553	27	85	14	85	13	Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
16554	27	86	1	86	1	A prayer of David. Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
16555	27	86	2	86	2	Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.
16556	27	86	3	86	3	Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I call to You all day long.
16557	27	86	4	86	4	Bring joy to Your servant, for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
16558	27	86	5	86	5	For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.
16559	27	86	6	86	6	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and attend to my plea for mercy.
16560	27	86	7	86	7	In the day of my distress I call on You, because You answer me.
16561	27	86	8	86	8	O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, nor any works like Yours.
16562	27	86	9	86	9	All the nations You have made will come and bow before You, O Lord, and they will glorify Your name.
16563	27	86	10	86	10	For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.
16564	27	86	11	86	11	Teach me Your way, O LORD, that I may walk in Your truth. Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name.
16565	27	86	12	86	12	I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever.
16566	27	86	13	86	13	For great is Your loving devotion to me; You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.
16567	27	86	14	86	14	The arrogant rise against me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, with no regard for You.
16568	27	86	15	86	15	But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness.
16569	27	86	16	86	16	Turn to me and have mercy; grant Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your maidservant.
16570	27	86	17	86	17	Show me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see and be ashamed; for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
16571	27	87	1	87	1	A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A song. He has founded His city on the holy mountains.
16572	27	87	2	87	2	The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
16573	27	87	3	87	3	Glorious things are ascribed to you, O city of God. Selah
16574	27	87	4	87	4	“I will mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me—along with Philistia, Tyre, and Cush—when I say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’”
16575	27	87	5	87	5	And it will be said of Zion: “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High Himself will establish her.”
16576	27	87	6	87	6	The LORD will record in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.” Selah
16577	27	87	7	87	7	Singers and pipers will proclaim, “All my springs of joy are in You.”
16578	27	88	1	88	0	A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.
16579	27	88	2	88	1	O LORD, the God of my salvation, day and night I cry out before You.
16580	27	88	3	88	2	May my prayer come before You; incline Your ear to my cry.
16581	27	88	4	88	3	For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol.
16582	27	88	5	88	4	I am counted among those descending to the Pit. I am like a man without strength.
16583	27	88	6	88	5	I am forsaken among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, who are cut off from Your care.
16584	27	88	7	88	6	You have laid me in the lowest Pit, in the darkest of the depths.
16585	27	88	8	88	7	Your wrath weighs heavily upon me; all Your waves have submerged me. Selah
16586	27	88	9	88	8	You have removed my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them; I am confined and cannot escape.
16587	27	88	10	88	9	My eyes grow dim with grief. I call to You daily, O LORD; I spread out my hands to You.
16588	27	88	11	88	10	Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah
16589	27	88	12	88	11	Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
16590	27	88	13	88	12	Will Your wonders be known in the darkness, or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
16591	27	88	14	88	13	But to You, O LORD, I cry for help; in the morning my prayer comes before You.
16592	27	88	15	88	14	Why, O LORD, do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?
16593	27	88	16	88	15	From my youth I was afflicted and near death. I have borne Your terrors; I am in despair.
16594	27	88	17	88	16	Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.
16595	27	88	18	88	17	All day long they engulf me like water; they enclose me on every side.
16596	27	88	19	88	18	You have removed my beloved and my friend; darkness is my closest companion.
16597	27	89	1	89	0	A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
16598	27	89	2	89	1	I will sing of the loving devotion of the LORD forever; with my mouth I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations.
16599	27	89	3	89	2	For I have said, “Loving devotion is built up forever; in the heavens You establish Your faithfulness.”
16600	27	89	4	89	3	You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant:
16601	27	89	5	89	4	‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’” Selah
16602	27	89	6	89	5	The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD—Your faithfulness as well—in the assembly of the holy ones.
16603	27	89	7	89	6	For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD?
16604	27	89	8	89	7	In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared, and awesome above all who surround Him.
16605	27	89	9	89	8	O LORD God of Hosts, who is like You? O mighty LORD, Your faithfulness surrounds You.
16606	27	89	10	89	9	You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them.
16607	27	89	11	89	10	You crushed Rahab like a carcass; You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
16608	27	89	12	89	11	The heavens are Yours, and also the earth. The earth and its fullness You founded.
16609	27	89	13	89	12	North and south You created; Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
16610	27	89	14	89	13	Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand. Your right hand is exalted.
16611	27	89	15	89	14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; loving devotion and faithfulness go before You.
16612	27	89	16	89	15	Blessed are those who know the joyful sound, who walk, O LORD, in the light of Your presence.
16613	27	89	17	89	16	They rejoice in Your name all day long, and in Your righteousness they exult.
16614	27	89	18	89	17	For You are the glory of their strength, and by Your favor our horn is exalted.
16615	27	89	19	89	18	Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, and our king to the Holy One of Israel.
16616	27	89	20	89	19	You once spoke in a vision; to Your godly ones You said, “I have bestowed help on a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
16617	27	89	21	89	20	I have found My servant David; with My sacred oil I have anointed him.
16618	27	89	22	89	21	My hand will sustain him; surely My arm will strengthen him.
16619	27	89	23	89	22	No enemy will exact tribute; no wicked man will oppress him.
16620	27	89	24	89	23	I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
16621	27	89	25	89	24	My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted.
16622	27	89	26	89	25	I will set his hand over the sea, and his right hand upon the rivers.
16623	27	89	27	89	26	He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock of my salvation.’
16624	27	89	28	89	27	I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
16625	27	89	29	89	28	I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, and My covenant with him will stand fast.
16626	27	89	30	89	29	I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.
16627	27	89	31	89	30	If his sons forsake My law and do not walk in My judgments,
16628	27	89	32	89	31	if they violate My statutes and fail to keep My commandments,
16629	27	89	33	89	32	I will attend to their transgression with the rod, and to their iniquity with stripes.
16630	27	89	34	89	33	But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, nor ever betray My faithfulness.
16631	27	89	35	89	34	I will not violate My covenant or alter the utterance of My lips.
16632	27	89	36	89	35	Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness—I will not lie to David—
16633	27	89	37	89	36	his offspring shall endure forever, and his throne before Me like the sun,
16634	27	89	38	89	37	like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah
16635	27	89	39	89	38	Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; You are enraged by Your anointed one.
16636	27	89	40	89	39	You have renounced the covenant with Your servant and sullied his crown in the dust.
16637	27	89	41	89	40	You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his strongholds to rubble.
16638	27	89	42	89	41	All who pass by plunder him; he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
16639	27	89	43	89	42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice.
16640	27	89	44	89	43	You have bent the edge of his sword and have not sustained him in battle.
16641	27	89	45	89	44	You have ended his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.
16642	27	89	46	89	45	You have cut short the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah
16643	27	89	47	89	46	How long, O LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath keep burning like fire?
16644	27	89	48	89	47	Remember the briefness of my lifespan! For what futility You have created all men!
16645	27	89	49	89	48	What man can live and never see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
16646	27	89	50	89	49	Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old, which You faithfully swore to David?
16647	27	89	51	89	50	Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, which I bear in my heart from so many people—
16648	27	89	52	89	51	how Your enemies have taunted, O LORD, and have mocked every step of Your anointed one!
16649	27	89	53	89	52	Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and amen.
16650	27	90	1	90	1	A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, You have been our dwelling place through all generations.
16651	27	90	2	90	2	Before the mountains were born or You brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.
16652	27	90	3	90	3	You return man to dust, saying, “Return, O sons of mortals.”
16653	27	90	4	90	4	For in Your sight a thousand years are but a day that passes, or a watch of the night.
16654	27	90	5	90	5	You whisk them away in their sleep; they are like the new grass of the morning—
16655	27	90	6	90	6	in the morning it springs up new, but by evening it fades and withers.
16656	27	90	7	90	7	For we are consumed by Your anger and terrified by Your wrath.
16657	27	90	8	90	8	You have set our iniquities before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.
16658	27	90	9	90	9	For all our days decline in Your fury; we finish our years with a sigh.
16659	27	90	10	90	10	The length of our days is seventy years—or eighty if we are strong—yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
16660	27	90	11	90	11	Who knows the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear You are due.
16661	27	90	12	90	12	So teach us to number our days, that we may present a heart of wisdom.
16662	27	90	13	90	13	Return, O LORD! How long will it be? Have compassion on Your servants.
16663	27	90	14	90	14	Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
16664	27	90	15	90	15	Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.
16665	27	90	16	90	16	May Your work be shown to Your servants, and Your splendor to their children.
16666	27	90	17	90	17	May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish for us the work of our hands—yes, establish the work of our hands!
16667	27	91	1	91	1	He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
16668	27	91	2	91	2	I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”
16669	27	91	3	91	3	Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly plague.
16670	27	91	4	91	4	He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.
16671	27	91	5	91	5	You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
16672	27	91	6	91	6	nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the calamity that destroys at noon.
16673	27	91	7	91	7	Though a thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, no harm will come near you.
16674	27	91	8	91	8	You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.
16675	27	91	9	91	9	Because you have made the LORD your dwelling—my refuge, the Most High—
16676	27	91	10	91	10	no evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent.
16677	27	91	11	91	11	For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
16678	27	91	12	91	12	They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
16679	27	91	13	91	13	You will tread on the lion and cobra; you will trample the young lion and serpent.
16680	27	91	14	91	14	“Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him.
16681	27	91	15	91	15	When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor him.
16682	27	91	16	91	16	With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
16683	27	92	1	92	0	A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.
16684	27	92	2	92	1	It is good to praise the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High,
16685	27	92	3	92	2	to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning and Your faithfulness at night
16686	27	92	4	92	3	with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre.
16687	27	92	5	92	4	For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds; I sing for joy at the works of Your hands.
16688	27	92	6	92	5	How great are Your works, O LORD, how deep are Your thoughts!
16689	27	92	7	92	6	A senseless man does not know, and a fool does not understand,
16690	27	92	8	92	7	that though the wicked sprout like grass, and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.
16691	27	92	9	92	8	But You, O LORD, are exalted forever!
16692	27	92	10	92	9	For surely Your enemies, O LORD, surely Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
16693	27	92	11	92	10	But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; with fine oil I have been anointed.
16694	27	92	12	92	11	My eyes see the downfall of my enemies; my ears hear the wailing of my wicked foes.
16695	27	92	13	92	12	The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
16696	27	92	14	92	13	Planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.
16697	27	92	15	92	14	In old age they will still bear fruit; healthy and green they will remain,
16698	27	92	16	92	15	to proclaim, “The LORD is upright; He is my Rock, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.”
16699	27	93	1	93	1	The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
16700	27	93	2	93	2	Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity.
16701	27	93	3	93	3	The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves.
16702	27	93	4	93	4	Above the roar of many waters—the mighty breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is majestic.
16703	27	93	5	93	5	Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
16704	27	94	1	94	1	O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth.
16705	27	94	2	94	2	Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.
16706	27	94	3	94	3	How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked exult?
16707	27	94	4	94	4	They pour out arrogant words; all workers of iniquity boast.
16708	27	94	5	94	5	They crush Your people, O LORD; they oppress Your heritage.
16709	27	94	6	94	6	They kill the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.
16710	27	94	7	94	7	They say, “The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.”
16711	27	94	8	94	8	Take notice, O senseless among the people! O fools, when will you be wise?
16712	27	94	9	94	9	He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? He who formed the eye, can He not see?
16713	27	94	10	94	10	He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge?
16714	27	94	11	94	11	The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
16715	27	94	12	94	12	Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD, and teach from Your law,
16716	27	94	13	94	13	to grant him relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
16717	27	94	14	94	14	For the LORD will not forsake His people; He will never abandon His heritage.
16718	27	94	15	94	15	Surely judgment will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
16719	27	94	16	94	16	Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?
16720	27	94	17	94	17	Unless the LORD had been my helper, I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.
16721	27	94	18	94	18	If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me.
16722	27	94	19	94	19	When anxiety overwhelms me, Your consolation delights my soul.
16723	27	94	20	94	20	Can a corrupt throne be Your ally—one devising mischief by decree?
16724	27	94	21	94	21	They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
16725	27	94	22	94	22	But the LORD has been my stronghold, and my God is my rock of refuge.
16726	27	94	23	94	23	He will bring upon them their own iniquity and destroy them for their wickedness. The LORD our God will destroy them.
16727	27	95	1	95	1	Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout to the Rock of our salvation!
16728	27	95	2	95	2	Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.
16729	27	95	3	95	3	For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods.
16730	27	95	4	95	4	In His hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.
16731	27	95	5	95	5	The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
16732	27	95	6	95	6	O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.
16733	27	95	7	95	7	For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice,
16734	27	95	8	95	8	do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, in the day at Massah in the wilderness,
16735	27	95	9	95	9	where your fathers tested and tried Me, though they had seen My work.
16736	27	95	10	95	10	For forty years I was angry with that generation, and I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known My ways.”
16737	27	95	11	95	11	So I swore on oath in My anger, “They shall never enter My rest.”
16738	27	96	1	96	1	Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.
16739	27	96	2	96	2	Sing to the LORD, praise His name; proclaim His salvation day after day.
16740	27	96	3	96	3	Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples.
16741	27	96	4	96	4	For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
16742	27	96	5	96	5	For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.
16743	27	96	6	96	6	Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.
16744	27	96	7	96	7	Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
16745	27	96	8	96	8	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.
16746	27	96	9	96	9	Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.
16747	27	96	10	96	10	Declare among the nations: “The LORD reigns!” The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity.
16748	27	96	11	96	11	Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea resound, and all that fills it.
16749	27	96	12	96	12	Let the fields exult, and all that is in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
16750	27	96	13	96	13	before the LORD, for He is coming—He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.
16751	27	97	1	97	1	The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the distant shores be glad.
16752	27	97	2	97	2	Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne’s foundation.
16753	27	97	3	97	3	Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side.
16754	27	97	4	97	4	His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles.
16755	27	97	5	97	5	The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
16756	27	97	6	97	6	The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory.
16757	27	97	7	97	7	All worshipers of images are put to shame—those who boast in idols. Worship Him, all you gods!
16758	27	97	8	97	8	Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments, O LORD.
16759	27	97	9	97	9	For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.
16760	27	97	10	97	10	O you who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
16761	27	97	11	97	11	Light shines on the righteous, gladness on the upright in heart.
16762	27	97	12	97	12	Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.
16763	27	98	1	98	1	A Psalm. Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done wonders; His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory.
16764	27	98	2	98	2	The LORD has proclaimed His salvation and revealed His righteousness to the nations.
16765	27	98	3	98	3	He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
16766	27	98	4	98	4	Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth—let your cry ring out, and sing praises!
16767	27	98	5	98	5	Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, in melodious song with the harp.
16768	27	98	6	98	6	With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
16769	27	98	7	98	7	Let the sea resound, and all that fills it, the world, and all who dwell in it.
16770	27	98	8	98	8	Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy
16771	27	98	9	98	9	before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
16772	27	99	1	99	1	The LORD reigns; let the nations tremble! He is enthroned above the cherubim; let the earth quake!
16773	27	99	2	99	2	Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples.
16774	27	99	3	99	3	Let them praise Your great and awesome name—He is holy!
16775	27	99	4	99	4	The mighty King loves justice. You have established equity; You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob.
16776	27	99	5	99	5	Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy!
16777	27	99	6	99	6	Moses and Aaron were among His priests; Samuel was among those who called on His name. They called to the LORD and He answered.
16778	27	99	7	99	7	He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them.
16779	27	99	8	99	8	O LORD our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, yet an avenger of their misdeeds.
16780	27	99	9	99	9	Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.
16781	27	100	1	100	1	A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.
16782	27	100	2	100	2	Serve the LORD with gladness; come into His presence with joyful songs.
16783	27	100	3	100	3	Know that the LORD is God. It is He who made us, and we are His; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
16784	27	100	4	100	4	Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name.
16785	27	100	5	100	5	For the LORD is good, and His loving devotion endures forever; His faithfulness continues to all generations.
16786	27	101	1	101	1	A Psalm of David. I will sing of Your loving devotion and justice; to You, O LORD, I will sing praises.
16787	27	101	2	101	2	I will ponder the way that is blameless—when will You come to me? I will walk in my house with integrity of heart.
16788	27	101	3	101	3	I will set no worthless thing before my eyes. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
16789	27	101	4	101	4	A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know nothing of evil.
16790	27	101	5	101	5	Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not endure.
16791	27	101	6	101	6	My eyes favor the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way of integrity shall minister to me.
16792	27	101	7	101	7	No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who tells lies shall stand in my presence.
16793	27	101	8	101	8	Every morning I will remove all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
16794	27	102	1	102	0	A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD.
16795	27	102	2	102	1	Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come before You.
16796	27	102	3	102	2	Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline Your ear to me; answer me quickly when I call.
16797	27	102	4	102	3	For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers.
16798	27	102	5	102	4	My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my bread.
16799	27	102	6	102	5	Through my loud groaning my flesh clings to my bones.
16800	27	102	7	102	6	I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.
16801	27	102	8	102	7	I lie awake; I am like a lone bird on a housetop.
16802	27	102	9	102	8	All day long my enemies taunt me; they ridicule me and curse me.
16803	27	102	10	102	9	For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears
16804	27	102	11	102	10	because of Your indignation and wrath, for You have picked me up and cast me aside.
16805	27	102	12	102	11	My days are like lengthening shadows, and I wither away like grass.
16806	27	102	13	102	12	But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures to all generations.
16807	27	102	14	102	13	You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor—the appointed time has come.
16808	27	102	15	102	14	For Your servants delight in her stones and take pity on her dust.
16809	27	102	16	102	15	So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory.
16810	27	102	17	102	16	For the LORD will rebuild Zion; He has appeared in His glory.
16811	27	102	18	102	17	He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their prayer.
16812	27	102	19	102	18	Let this be written for the generation to come, so that a people not yet created may praise the LORD.
16813	27	102	20	102	19	For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth
16814	27	102	21	102	20	to hear a prisoner’s groaning, to release those condemned to death,
16815	27	102	22	102	21	that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion and praise Him in Jerusalem,
16816	27	102	23	102	22	when peoples and kingdoms assemble to serve the LORD.
16817	27	102	24	102	23	He has broken my strength on the way; He has cut short my days.
16818	27	102	25	102	24	I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days! Your years go on through all generations.
16819	27	102	26	102	25	In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
16820	27	102	27	102	26	They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on.
16821	27	102	28	102	27	But You remain the same, and Your years will never end.
16822	27	102	29	102	28	The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You.”
16823	27	103	1	103	1	Of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name.
16824	27	103	2	103	2	Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all His kind deeds—
16825	27	103	3	103	3	He who forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases,
16826	27	103	4	103	4	who redeems your life from the Pit and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,
16827	27	103	5	103	5	who satisfies you with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
16828	27	103	6	103	6	The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
16829	27	103	7	103	7	He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.
16830	27	103	8	103	8	The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.
16831	27	103	9	103	9	He will not always accuse us, nor harbor His anger forever.
16832	27	103	10	103	10	He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities.
16833	27	103	11	103	11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.
16834	27	103	12	103	12	As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
16835	27	103	13	103	13	As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
16836	27	103	14	103	14	For He knows our frame; He is mindful that we are dust.
16837	27	103	15	103	15	As for man, his days are like grass—he blooms like a flower of the field;
16838	27	103	16	103	16	when the wind passes over, it vanishes, and its place remembers it no more.
16839	27	103	17	103	17	But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children—
16840	27	103	18	103	18	to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts.
16841	27	103	19	103	19	The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.
16842	27	103	20	103	20	Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command.
16843	27	103	21	103	21	Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will.
16844	27	103	22	103	22	Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
16845	27	104	1	104	1	Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty.
16846	27	104	2	104	2	He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; He stretches out the heavens like a tent,
16847	27	104	3	104	3	laying the beams of His chambers in the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind.
16848	27	104	4	104	4	He makes the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.
16849	27	104	5	104	5	He set the earth on its foundations, never to be moved.
16850	27	104	6	104	6	You covered it with the deep like a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
16851	27	104	7	104	7	At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away—
16852	27	104	8	104	8	the mountains rose and the valleys sank to the place You assigned for them—
16853	27	104	9	104	9	You set a boundary they cannot cross, that they may never again cover the earth.
16854	27	104	10	104	10	He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains.
16855	27	104	11	104	11	They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
16856	27	104	12	104	12	The birds of the air nest beside the springs; they sing among the branches.
16857	27	104	13	104	13	He waters the mountains from His chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.
16858	27	104	14	104	14	He makes the grass grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth:
16859	27	104	15	104	15	wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil that makes his face to shine, and bread that sustains his heart.
16860	27	104	16	104	16	The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted,
16861	27	104	17	104	17	where the birds build their nests; the stork makes her home in the cypresses.
16862	27	104	18	104	18	The high mountains are for the wild goats, the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers.
16863	27	104	19	104	19	He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.
16864	27	104	20	104	20	You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the beasts of the forest prowl.
16865	27	104	21	104	21	The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
16866	27	104	22	104	22	The sun rises, and they withdraw; they lie down in their dens.
16867	27	104	23	104	23	Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until evening.
16868	27	104	24	104	24	How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.
16869	27	104	25	104	25	Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number, living things both great and small.
16870	27	104	26	104	26	There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.
16871	27	104	27	104	27	All creatures look to You to give them their food in due season.
16872	27	104	28	104	28	When You give it to them, they gather it up; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
16873	27	104	29	104	29	When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to dust.
16874	27	104	30	104	30	When You send Your Spirit, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.
16875	27	104	31	104	31	May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in His works.
16876	27	104	32	104	32	He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smolder.
16877	27	104	33	104	33	I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
16878	27	104	34	104	34	May my meditation be pleasing to Him, for I rejoice in the LORD.
16879	27	104	35	104	35	May sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah!
16880	27	105	1	105	1	Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.
16881	27	105	2	105	2	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.
16882	27	105	3	105	3	Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
16883	27	105	4	105	4	Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.
16884	27	105	5	105	5	Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,
16885	27	105	6	105	6	O offspring of His servant Abraham, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
16886	27	105	7	105	7	He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.
16887	27	105	8	105	8	He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—
16888	27	105	9	105	9	the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.
16889	27	105	10	105	10	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
16890	27	105	11	105	11	“I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”
16891	27	105	12	105	12	When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,
16892	27	105	13	105	13	they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
16893	27	105	14	105	14	He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
16894	27	105	15	105	15	“Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!”
16895	27	105	16	105	16	He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food.
16896	27	105	17	105	17	He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave.
16897	27	105	18	105	18	They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,
16898	27	105	19	105	19	until his prediction came true and the word of the LORD proved him right.
16899	27	105	20	105	20	The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.
16900	27	105	21	105	21	He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,
16901	27	105	22	105	22	to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
16902	27	105	23	105	23	Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.
16903	27	105	24	105	24	And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,
16904	27	105	25	105	25	whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.
16905	27	105	26	105	26	He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
16906	27	105	27	105	27	They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
16907	27	105	28	105	28	He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied His words.
16908	27	105	29	105	29	He turned their waters to blood and caused their fish to die.
16909	27	105	30	105	30	Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.
16910	27	105	31	105	31	He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their country.
16911	27	105	32	105	32	He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.
16912	27	105	33	105	33	He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
16913	27	105	34	105	34	He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without number.
16914	27	105	35	105	35	They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.
16915	27	105	36	105	36	Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.
16916	27	105	37	105	37	He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.
16917	27	105	38	105	38	Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.
16918	27	105	39	105	39	He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.
16919	27	105	40	105	40	They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
16920	27	105	41	105	41	He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.
16921	27	105	42	105	42	For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.
16922	27	105	43	105	43	He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.
16923	27	105	44	105	44	He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others’ labor,
16924	27	105	45	105	45	that they might keep His statutes and obey His laws. Hallelujah!
16925	27	106	1	106	1	Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
16926	27	106	2	106	2	Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD or fully proclaim His praise?
16927	27	106	3	106	3	Blessed are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.
16928	27	106	4	106	4	Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation,
16929	27	106	5	106	5	that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, and give glory with Your inheritance.
16930	27	106	6	106	6	We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
16931	27	106	7	106	7	Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders or remember Your abundant kindness; but they rebelled by the sea, there at the Red Sea.
16932	27	106	8	106	8	Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, to make His power known.
16933	27	106	9	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.
16934	27	106	10	106	10	He saved them from the hand that hated them; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
16935	27	106	11	106	11	The waters covered their foes; not one of them remained.
16936	27	106	12	106	12	Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.
16937	27	106	13	106	13	Yet they soon forgot His works and failed to wait for His counsel.
16938	27	106	14	106	14	They craved intensely in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.
16939	27	106	15	106	15	So He granted their request, but sent a wasting disease upon them.
16940	27	106	16	106	16	In the camp they envied Moses, as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
16941	27	106	17	106	17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.
16942	27	106	18	106	18	Then fire blazed through their company; flames consumed the wicked.
16943	27	106	19	106	19	At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped a molten image.
16944	27	106	20	106	20	They exchanged their Glory for the image of a grass-eating ox.
16945	27	106	21	106	21	They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,
16946	27	106	22	106	22	wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
16947	27	106	23	106	23	So He said He would destroy them—had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach to divert His wrath from destroying them.
16948	27	106	24	106	24	They despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His promise.
16949	27	106	25	106	25	They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
16950	27	106	26	106	26	So He raised His hand and swore to cast them down in the wilderness,
16951	27	106	27	106	27	to disperse their offspring among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
16952	27	106	28	106	28	They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
16953	27	106	29	106	29	So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
16954	27	106	30	106	30	But Phinehas stood and intervened, and the plague was restrained.
16955	27	106	31	106	31	It was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
16956	27	106	32	106	32	At the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them.
16957	27	106	33	106	33	For they rebelled against His Spirit, and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.
16958	27	106	34	106	34	They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
16959	27	106	35	106	35	but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
16960	27	106	36	106	36	They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
16961	27	106	37	106	37	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
16962	27	106	38	106	38	They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
16963	27	106	39	106	39	They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
16964	27	106	40	106	40	So the anger of the LORD burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.
16965	27	106	41	106	41	He delivered them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
16966	27	106	42	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them, and subdued them under their hand.
16967	27	106	43	106	43	Many times He rescued them, but they were bent on rebellion and sank down in their iniquity.
16968	27	106	44	106	44	Nevertheless He heard their cry; He took note of their distress.
16969	27	106	45	106	45	And He remembered His covenant with them, and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.
16970	27	106	46	106	46	He made them objects of compassion to all who held them captive.
16971	27	106	47	106	47	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.
16972	27	106	48	106	48	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
16973	27	107	1	107	1	Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
16974	27	107	2	107	2	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy
16975	27	107	3	107	3	and gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.
16976	27	107	4	107	4	Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no path to a city in which to dwell.
16977	27	107	5	107	5	They were hungry and thirsty; their soul fainted within them.
16978	27	107	6	107	6	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress.
16979	27	107	7	107	7	He led them on a straight path to reach a city where they could live.
16980	27	107	8	107	8	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
16981	27	107	9	107	9	For He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
16982	27	107	10	107	10	Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains,
16983	27	107	11	107	11	because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.
16984	27	107	12	107	12	He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
16985	27	107	13	107	13	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.
16986	27	107	14	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke away their chains.
16987	27	107	15	107	15	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
16988	27	107	16	107	16	For He has broken down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.
16989	27	107	17	107	17	Fools, in their rebellious ways, and through their iniquities, suffered affliction.
16990	27	107	18	107	18	They loathed all food and drew near to the gates of death.
16991	27	107	19	107	19	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them from their distress.
16992	27	107	20	107	20	He sent forth His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit.
16993	27	107	21	107	21	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
16994	27	107	22	107	22	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare His works with rejoicing.
16995	27	107	23	107	23	Others went out to sea in ships, conducting trade on the mighty waters.
16996	27	107	24	107	24	They saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep.
16997	27	107	25	107	25	For He spoke and raised a tempest that lifted the waves of the sea.
16998	27	107	26	107	26	They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; their courage melted in their anguish.
16999	27	107	27	107	27	They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and all their skill was useless.
17000	27	107	28	107	28	Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.
17001	27	107	29	107	29	He calmed the storm to a whisper, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
17002	27	107	30	107	30	They rejoiced in the silence, and He guided them to the harbor they desired.
17003	27	107	31	107	31	Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion and His wonders to the sons of men.
17004	27	107	32	107	32	Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.
17005	27	107	33	107	33	He turns rivers into deserts, springs of water into thirsty ground,
17006	27	107	34	107	34	and fruitful land into fields of salt, because of the wickedness of its dwellers.
17007	27	107	35	107	35	He turns a desert into pools of water and a dry land into flowing springs.
17008	27	107	36	107	36	He causes the hungry to settle there, that they may establish a city in which to dwell.
17009	27	107	37	107	37	They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.
17010	27	107	38	107	38	He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their herds diminish.
17011	27	107	39	107	39	When they are decreased and humbled by oppression, evil, and sorrow,
17012	27	107	40	107	40	He pours contempt on the nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
17013	27	107	41	107	41	But He lifts the needy from affliction and increases their families like flocks.
17014	27	107	42	107	42	The upright see and rejoice, and all iniquity shuts its mouth.
17015	27	107	43	107	43	Let him who is wise pay heed to these things and consider the loving devotion of the LORD.
17016	27	108	1	108	0	A song. A Psalm of David.
17017	27	108	2	108	1	My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my being.
17018	27	108	3	108	2	Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
17019	27	108	4	108	3	I will praise You, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing Your praises among the nations.
17020	27	108	5	108	4	For Your loving devotion is higher than the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the skies.
17021	27	108	6	108	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Your glory cover the earth.
17022	27	108	7	108	6	In order that Your beloved may be delivered, save me by Your right hand and answer me!
17023	27	108	8	108	7	God has spoken in His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem, and apportion the Valley of Succoth.
17024	27	108	9	108	8	Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet and Judah My scepter.
17025	27	108	10	108	9	Moab is My washbasin; on Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
17026	27	108	11	108	10	Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
17027	27	108	12	108	11	Have You rejected us, O God? Do You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?
17028	27	108	13	108	12	Give us aid against the foe, for the help of man is worthless.
17029	27	108	14	108	13	With God we perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
17030	27	109	1	109	1	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, do not be silent.
17031	27	109	2	109	2	For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.
17032	27	109	3	109	3	They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.
17033	27	109	4	109	4	In return for my love they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.
17034	27	109	5	109	5	They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
17035	27	109	6	109	6	Set over him a wicked man; let an accuser stand at his right hand.
17036	27	109	7	109	7	When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayer be regarded as sin.
17037	27	109	8	109	8	May his days be few; may another take his position.
17038	27	109	9	109	9	May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.
17039	27	109	10	109	10	May his children wander as beggars, seeking sustenance far from their ruined homes.
17040	27	109	11	109	11	May the creditor seize all he owns, and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
17041	27	109	12	109	12	May there be no one to extend kindness to him, and no one to favor his fatherless children.
17042	27	109	13	109	13	May his descendants be cut off; may their name be blotted out from the next generation.
17043	27	109	14	109	14	May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and the sin of his mother never be blotted out.
17044	27	109	15	109	15	May their sins always remain before the LORD, that He may cut off their memory from the earth.
17045	27	109	16	109	16	For he never thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, even to their death.
17046	27	109	17	109	17	The cursing that he loved, may it fall on him; the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.
17047	27	109	18	109	18	The cursing that he wore like a coat, may it soak into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.
17048	27	109	19	109	19	May it be like a robe wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.
17049	27	109	20	109	20	May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me.
17050	27	109	21	109	21	But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion.
17051	27	109	22	109	22	For I am poor and needy; my heart is wounded within me.
17052	27	109	23	109	23	I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.
17053	27	109	24	109	24	My knees are weak from fasting, and my body grows lean and gaunt.
17054	27	109	25	109	25	I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.
17055	27	109	26	109	26	Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to Your loving devotion.
17056	27	109	27	109	27	Let them know that this is Your hand, that You, O LORD, have done it.
17057	27	109	28	109	28	Though they curse, You will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but Your servant will rejoice.
17058	27	109	29	109	29	May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; may they wear their shame like a robe.
17059	27	109	30	109	30	With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; I will praise Him in the presence of many.
17060	27	109	31	109	31	For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from the condemners of his soul.
17061	27	110	1	110	1	A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”
17062	27	110	2	110	2	The LORD extends Your mighty scepter from Zion: “Rule in the midst of Your enemies.”
17063	27	110	3	110	3	Your people shall be willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, to You belongs the dew of Your youth.
17064	27	110	4	110	4	The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
17065	27	110	5	110	5	The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings in the day of His wrath.
17066	27	110	6	110	6	He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead; He will crush the leaders far and wide.
17067	27	110	7	110	7	He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore He will lift up His head.
17068	27	111	1	111	1	Hallelujah! I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
17069	27	111	2	111	2	Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them.
17070	27	111	3	111	3	Splendid and majestic is His work; His righteousness endures forever.
17071	27	111	4	111	4	He has caused His wonders to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and compassionate.
17072	27	111	5	111	5	He provides food for those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever.
17073	27	111	6	111	6	He has shown His people the power of His works by giving them the inheritance of the nations.
17074	27	111	7	111	7	The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are trustworthy.
17075	27	111	8	111	8	They are upheld forever and ever, enacted in truth and uprightness.
17076	27	111	9	111	9	He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.
17077	27	111	10	111	10	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His precepts gain rich understanding. His praise endures forever!
17078	27	112	1	112	1	Hallelujah! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.
17079	27	112	2	112	2	His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
17080	27	112	3	112	3	Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
17081	27	112	4	112	4	Light dawns in the darkness for the upright—for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
17082	27	112	5	112	5	It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.
17083	27	112	6	112	6	Surely he will never be shaken; the righteous man will be remembered forever.
17084	27	112	7	112	7	He does not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.
17085	27	112	8	112	8	His heart is assured; he does not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.
17086	27	112	9	112	9	He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.
17087	27	112	10	112	10	The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
17088	27	113	1	113	1	Hallelujah! Give praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD.
17089	27	113	2	113	2	Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore.
17090	27	113	3	113	3	From the rising to the setting of the sun, the name of the LORD is praised.
17091	27	113	4	113	4	The LORD is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens.
17092	27	113	5	113	5	Who is like the LORD our God, the One enthroned on high?
17093	27	113	6	113	6	He humbles Himself to behold the heavens and the earth.
17094	27	113	7	113	7	He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the dump
17095	27	113	8	113	8	to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people.
17096	27	113	9	113	9	He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother to her children. Hallelujah!
17097	27	114	1	114	1	When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
17098	27	114	2	114	2	Judah became God’s sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.
17099	27	114	3	114	3	The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;
17100	27	114	4	114	4	the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
17101	27	114	5	114	5	Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,
17102	27	114	6	114	6	O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?
17103	27	114	7	114	7	Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
17104	27	114	8	114	8	who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
17105	27	115	1	115	1	Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.
17106	27	115	2	115	2	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
17107	27	115	3	115	3	Our God is in heaven; He does as He pleases.
17108	27	115	4	115	4	Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
17109	27	115	5	115	5	They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
17110	27	115	6	115	6	they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;
17111	27	115	7	115	7	they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even clear their throats.
17112	27	115	8	115	8	Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.
17113	27	115	9	115	9	O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
17114	27	115	10	115	10	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
17115	27	115	11	115	11	You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
17116	27	115	12	115	12	The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;
17117	27	115	13	115	13	He will bless those who fear the LORD—small and great alike.
17118	27	115	14	115	14	May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.
17119	27	115	15	115	15	May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
17120	27	115	16	115	16	The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind.
17121	27	115	17	115	17	It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence.
17122	27	115	18	115	18	But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah!
17123	27	116	1	116	1	I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice—my appeal for mercy.
17124	27	116	2	116	2	Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live.
17125	27	116	3	116	3	The ropes of death entangled me, and the anguish of Sheol overcame me; I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.
17126	27	116	4	116	4	Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, deliver my soul!”
17127	27	116	5	116	5	The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.
17128	27	116	6	116	6	The LORD preserves the simplehearted; I was helpless, and He saved me.
17129	27	116	7	116	7	Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you.
17130	27	116	8	116	8	For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
17131	27	116	9	116	9	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
17132	27	116	10	116	10	I believed, therefore I have spoken: “I am greatly afflicted.”
17133	27	116	11	116	11	In my alarm I said, “All men are liars!”
17134	27	116	12	116	12	How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?
17135	27	116	13	116	13	I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.
17136	27	116	14	116	14	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people.
17137	27	116	15	116	15	Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.
17138	27	116	16	116	16	Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have broken my bonds.
17139	27	116	17	116	17	I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.
17140	27	116	18	116	18	I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people,
17141	27	116	19	116	19	in the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
17142	27	117	1	117	1	Praise the LORD, all you nations! Extol Him, all you peoples!
17143	27	117	2	117	2	For great is His loving devotion toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. Hallelujah!
17144	27	118	1	118	1	Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
17145	27	118	2	118	2	Let Israel say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”
17146	27	118	3	118	3	Let the house of Aaron say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”
17147	27	118	4	118	4	Let those who fear the LORD say, “His loving devotion endures forever.”
17148	27	118	5	118	5	In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered and set me free.
17149	27	118	6	118	6	The LORD is on my side; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
17150	27	118	7	118	7	The LORD is on my side; He is my helper. Therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.
17151	27	118	8	118	8	It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.
17152	27	118	9	118	9	It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.
17153	27	118	10	118	10	All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
17154	27	118	11	118	11	They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
17155	27	118	12	118	12	They swarmed around me like bees, but they were extinguished like burning thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
17156	27	118	13	118	13	I was pushed so hard I was falling, but the LORD helped me.
17157	27	118	14	118	14	The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation.
17158	27	118	15	118	15	Shouts of joy and salvation resound in the tents of the righteous: “The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!
17159	27	118	16	118	16	The right hand of the LORD is exalted! The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!”
17160	27	118	17	118	17	I will not die, but I will live and proclaim what the LORD has done.
17161	27	118	18	118	18	The LORD disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death.
17162	27	118	19	118	19	Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter and give thanks to the LORD.
17163	27	118	20	118	20	This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.
17164	27	118	21	118	21	I will give You thanks, for You have answered me, and You have become my salvation.
17165	27	118	22	118	22	The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
17166	27	118	23	118	23	This is from the LORD, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
17167	27	118	24	118	24	This is the day that the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
17168	27	118	25	118	25	O LORD, save us, we pray. We beseech You, O LORD, cause us to prosper!
17169	27	118	26	118	26	Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD. From the house of the LORD we bless you.
17170	27	118	27	118	27	The LORD is God and has made His light shine upon us. Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.
17171	27	118	28	118	28	You are my God, and I will give You thanks. You are my God, and I will exalt You.
17172	27	118	29	118	29	Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
17173	27	119	1	119	1	Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD.
17174	27	119	2	119	2	Blessed are those who keep His testimonies and seek Him with all their heart.
17175	27	119	3	119	3	They do no iniquity; they walk in His ways.
17176	27	119	4	119	4	You have ordained Your precepts, that we should keep them diligently.
17177	27	119	5	119	5	Oh, that my ways were committed to keeping Your statutes!
17178	27	119	6	119	6	Then I would not be ashamed when I consider all Your commandments.
17179	27	119	7	119	7	I will praise You with an upright heart when I learn Your righteous judgments.
17180	27	119	8	119	8	I will keep Your statutes; do not utterly forsake me.
17181	27	119	9	119	9	How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word.
17182	27	119	10	119	10	With all my heart I have sought You; do not let me stray from Your commandments.
17183	27	119	11	119	11	I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You.
17184	27	119	12	119	12	Blessed are You, O LORD; teach me Your statutes.
17185	27	119	13	119	13	With my lips I proclaim all the judgments of Your mouth.
17186	27	119	14	119	14	I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches.
17187	27	119	15	119	15	I will meditate on Your precepts and regard Your ways.
17188	27	119	16	119	16	I will delight in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.
17189	27	119	17	119	17	Deal bountifully with Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word.
17190	27	119	18	119	18	Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things from Your law.
17191	27	119	19	119	19	I am a stranger on the earth; do not hide Your commandments from me.
17192	27	119	20	119	20	My soul is consumed with longing for Your judgments at all times.
17193	27	119	21	119	21	You rebuke the arrogant—the cursed who stray from Your commandments.
17194	27	119	22	119	22	Remove my scorn and contempt, for I have kept Your testimonies.
17195	27	119	23	119	23	Though rulers sit and slander me, Your servant meditates on Your statutes.
17196	27	119	24	119	24	Your testimonies are indeed my delight; they are my counselors.
17197	27	119	25	119	25	My soul cleaves to the dust; revive me according to Your word.
17198	27	119	26	119	26	I recounted my ways, and You answered me; teach me Your statutes.
17199	27	119	27	119	27	Make clear to me the way of Your precepts; then I will meditate on Your wonders.
17200	27	119	28	119	28	My soul melts with sorrow; strengthen me according to Your word.
17201	27	119	29	119	29	Remove me from the path of deceit and graciously grant me Your law.
17202	27	119	30	119	30	I have chosen the way of truth; I have set Your ordinances before me.
17203	27	119	31	119	31	I cling to Your testimonies, O LORD; let me not be put to shame.
17204	27	119	32	119	32	I run in the path of Your commandments, for You will enlarge my heart.
17205	27	119	33	119	33	Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes, and I will keep them to the end.
17206	27	119	34	119	34	Give me understanding that I may obey Your law, and follow it with all my heart.
17207	27	119	35	119	35	Direct me in the path of Your commandments, for there I find delight.
17208	27	119	36	119	36	Turn my heart to Your testimonies and not to covetous gain.
17209	27	119	37	119	37	Turn my eyes away from worthless things; revive me with Your word.
17210	27	119	38	119	38	Establish Your word to Your servant, to produce reverence for You.
17211	27	119	39	119	39	Turn away the disgrace I dread, for Your judgments are good.
17212	27	119	40	119	40	How I long for Your precepts! Revive me in Your righteousness.
17213	27	119	41	119	41	May Your loving devotion come to me, O LORD, Your salvation, according to Your promise.
17214	27	119	42	119	42	Then I can answer him who taunts, for I trust in Your word.
17215	27	119	43	119	43	Never take Your word of truth from my mouth, for I hope in Your judgments.
17216	27	119	44	119	44	I will always obey Your law, forever and ever.
17217	27	119	45	119	45	And I will walk in freedom, for I have sought Your precepts.
17218	27	119	46	119	46	I will speak of Your testimonies before kings, and I will not be ashamed.
17219	27	119	47	119	47	I delight in Your commandments because I love them.
17220	27	119	48	119	48	I lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love, and I meditate on Your statutes.
17221	27	119	49	119	49	Remember Your word to Your servant, upon which You have given me hope.
17222	27	119	50	119	50	This is my comfort in affliction, that Your promise has given me life.
17223	27	119	51	119	51	The arrogant utterly deride me, but I do not turn from Your law.
17224	27	119	52	119	52	I remember Your judgments of old, O LORD, and in them I find comfort.
17225	27	119	53	119	53	Rage has taken hold of me because of the wicked who reject Your law.
17226	27	119	54	119	54	Your statutes are songs to me in the house of my pilgrimage.
17227	27	119	55	119	55	In the night, O LORD, I remember Your name, that I may keep Your law.
17228	27	119	56	119	56	This is my practice, for I obey Your precepts.
17229	27	119	57	119	57	The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep Your words.
17230	27	119	58	119	58	I have sought Your face with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your promise.
17231	27	119	59	119	59	I considered my ways and turned my steps to Your testimonies.
17232	27	119	60	119	60	I hurried without hesitating to keep Your commandments.
17233	27	119	61	119	61	Though the ropes of the wicked bind me, I do not forget Your law.
17234	27	119	62	119	62	At midnight I rise to give You thanks for Your righteous judgments.
17235	27	119	63	119	63	I am a friend to all who fear You, and to those who keep Your precepts.
17236	27	119	64	119	64	The earth is filled with Your loving devotion, O LORD; teach me Your statutes.
17237	27	119	65	119	65	You are good to Your servant, O LORD, according to Your word.
17238	27	119	66	119	66	Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in Your commandments.
17239	27	119	67	119	67	Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I keep Your word.
17240	27	119	68	119	68	You are good, and You do what is good; teach me Your statutes.
17241	27	119	69	119	69	Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies, I keep Your precepts with all my heart.
17242	27	119	70	119	70	Their hearts are hard and callous, but I delight in Your law.
17243	27	119	71	119	71	It was good for me to be afflicted, that I might learn Your statutes.
17244	27	119	72	119	72	The law from Your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.
17245	27	119	73	119	73	Your hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding to learn Your commandments.
17246	27	119	74	119	74	May those who fear You see me and rejoice, for I have hoped in Your word.
17247	27	119	75	119	75	I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.
17248	27	119	76	119	76	May Your loving devotion comfort me, I pray, according to Your promise to Your servant.
17249	27	119	77	119	77	May Your compassion come to me, that I may live, for Your law is my delight.
17250	27	119	78	119	78	May the arrogant be put to shame for subverting me with a lie; I will meditate on Your precepts.
17251	27	119	79	119	79	May those who fear You turn to me, those who know Your testimonies.
17252	27	119	80	119	80	May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, that I may not be put to shame.
17253	27	119	81	119	81	My soul faints for Your salvation; I wait for Your word.
17254	27	119	82	119	82	My eyes fail, looking for Your promise; I ask, “When will You comfort me?”
17255	27	119	83	119	83	Though I am like a wineskin dried up by smoke, I do not forget Your statutes.
17256	27	119	84	119	84	How many days must Your servant wait? When will You execute judgment on my persecutors?
17257	27	119	85	119	85	The arrogant have dug pits for me in violation of Your law.
17258	27	119	86	119	86	All Your commandments are faithful; I am persecuted without cause—help me!
17259	27	119	87	119	87	They almost wiped me from the earth, but I have not forsaken Your precepts.
17260	27	119	88	119	88	Revive me according to Your loving devotion, that I may obey the testimony of Your mouth.
17261	27	119	89	119	89	Your word, O LORD, is everlasting; it is firmly fixed in the heavens.
17262	27	119	90	119	90	Your faithfulness continues through all generations; You established the earth, and it endures.
17263	27	119	91	119	91	Your ordinances stand to this day, for all things are servants to You.
17264	27	119	92	119	92	If Your law had not been my delight, then I would have perished in my affliction.
17265	27	119	93	119	93	I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have revived me.
17266	27	119	94	119	94	I am Yours; save me, for I have sought Your precepts.
17267	27	119	95	119	95	The wicked wait to destroy me, but I will ponder Your testimonies.
17268	27	119	96	119	96	I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is without limit.
17269	27	119	97	119	97	Oh, how I love Your law! All day long it is my meditation.
17270	27	119	98	119	98	Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for they are always with me.
17271	27	119	99	119	99	I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation.
17272	27	119	100	119	100	I discern more than the elders, for I obey Your precepts.
17273	27	119	101	119	101	I have kept my feet from every evil path, that I may keep Your word.
17274	27	119	102	119	102	I have not departed from Your ordinances, for You Yourself have taught me.
17275	27	119	103	119	103	How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey in my mouth.
17276	27	119	104	119	104	I gain understanding from Your precepts; therefore I hate every false way.
17277	27	119	105	119	105	Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
17278	27	119	106	119	106	I have sworn and confirmed that I will keep Your righteous judgments.
17279	27	119	107	119	107	I am severely afflicted, O LORD; revive me through Your word.
17280	27	119	108	119	108	Accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me Your judgments.
17281	27	119	109	119	109	I constantly take my life in my hands, yet I do not forget Your law.
17282	27	119	110	119	110	The wicked have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from Your precepts.
17283	27	119	111	119	111	Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.
17284	27	119	112	119	112	I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes, even to the very end.
17285	27	119	113	119	113	The double-minded I despise, but Your law I love.
17286	27	119	114	119	114	You are my hiding place and my shield; I put my hope in Your word.
17287	27	119	115	119	115	Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may obey the commandments of my God.
17288	27	119	116	119	116	Sustain me as You promised, that I may live; let me not be ashamed of my hope.
17289	27	119	117	119	117	Uphold me, and I will be saved, that I may always regard Your statutes.
17290	27	119	118	119	118	You reject all who stray from Your statutes, for their deceitfulness is in vain.
17291	27	119	119	119	119	All the wicked on earth You discard like dross; therefore I love Your testimonies.
17292	27	119	120	119	120	My flesh trembles in awe of You; I stand in fear of Your judgments.
17293	27	119	121	119	121	I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors.
17294	27	119	122	119	122	Ensure Your servant’s well-being; do not let the arrogant oppress me.
17295	27	119	123	119	123	My eyes fail, looking for Your salvation, and for Your righteous promise.
17296	27	119	124	119	124	Deal with Your servant according to Your loving devotion, and teach me Your statutes.
17297	27	119	125	119	125	I am Your servant; give me understanding that I may know Your testimonies.
17298	27	119	126	119	126	It is time for the LORD to act, for they have broken Your law.
17299	27	119	127	119	127	Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold, even the purest gold.
17300	27	119	128	119	128	Therefore I admire all Your precepts and hate every false way.
17301	27	119	129	119	129	Wonderful are Your testimonies; therefore I obey them.
17302	27	119	130	119	130	The unfolding of Your words gives light; it informs the simple.
17303	27	119	131	119	131	I open my mouth and pant, longing for Your commandments.
17304	27	119	132	119	132	Turn to me and show me mercy, as You do to those who love Your name.
17305	27	119	133	119	133	Order my steps in Your word; let no sin rule over me.
17306	27	119	134	119	134	Redeem me from the oppression of man, that I may keep Your precepts.
17307	27	119	135	119	135	Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes.
17308	27	119	136	119	136	My eyes shed streams of tears because Your law is not obeyed.
17309	27	119	137	119	137	Righteous are You, O LORD, and upright are Your judgments.
17310	27	119	138	119	138	The testimonies You have laid down are righteous and altogether faithful.
17311	27	119	139	119	139	My zeal has consumed me because my foes forget Your words.
17312	27	119	140	119	140	Your promise is completely pure; therefore Your servant loves it.
17313	27	119	141	119	141	I am lowly and despised, but I do not forget Your precepts.
17314	27	119	142	119	142	Your righteousness is everlasting and Your law is true.
17315	27	119	143	119	143	Trouble and distress have found me, but Your commandments are my delight.
17316	27	119	144	119	144	Your testimonies are righteous forever. Give me understanding, that I may live.
17317	27	119	145	119	145	I call with all my heart; answer me, O LORD! I will obey Your statutes.
17318	27	119	146	119	146	I call to You; save me, that I may keep Your testimonies.
17319	27	119	147	119	147	I rise before dawn and cry for help; in Your word I have put my hope.
17320	27	119	148	119	148	My eyes anticipate the watches of night, that I may meditate on Your word.
17321	27	119	149	119	149	Hear my voice, O LORD, according to Your loving devotion; give me life according to Your justice.
17322	27	119	150	119	150	Those who follow after wickedness draw near; they are far from Your law.
17323	27	119	151	119	151	You are near, O LORD, and all Your commandments are true.
17324	27	119	152	119	152	Long ago I learned from Your testimonies that You have established them forever.
17325	27	119	153	119	153	Look upon my affliction and rescue me, for I have not forgotten Your law.
17326	27	119	154	119	154	Defend my cause and redeem me; revive me according to Your word.
17327	27	119	155	119	155	Salvation is far from the wicked because they do not seek Your statutes.
17328	27	119	156	119	156	Great are Your mercies, O LORD; revive me according to Your ordinances.
17329	27	119	157	119	157	Though my persecutors and foes are many, I have not turned from Your testimonies.
17330	27	119	158	119	158	I look on the faithless with loathing because they do not keep Your word.
17331	27	119	159	119	159	Consider how I love Your precepts, O LORD; give me life according to Your loving devotion.
17332	27	119	160	119	160	The entirety of Your word is truth, and all Your righteous judgments endure forever.
17333	27	119	161	119	161	Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart fears only Your word.
17334	27	119	162	119	162	I rejoice in Your promise like one who finds great spoil.
17335	27	119	163	119	163	I hate and abhor falsehood, but Your law I love.
17336	27	119	164	119	164	Seven times a day I praise You for Your righteous judgments.
17337	27	119	165	119	165	Abundant peace belongs to those who love Your instruction; nothing can make them stumble.
17338	27	119	166	119	166	I wait for Your salvation, O LORD, and I carry out Your commandments.
17339	27	119	167	119	167	I obey Your testimonies and love them greatly.
17340	27	119	168	119	168	I obey Your precepts and Your testimonies, for all my ways are before You.
17341	27	119	169	119	169	May my cry come before You, O LORD; give me understanding according to Your word.
17342	27	119	170	119	170	May my plea come before You; rescue me according to Your promise.
17343	27	119	171	119	171	My lips pour forth praise, for You teach me Your statutes.
17344	27	119	172	119	172	My tongue sings of Your word, for all Your commandments are righteous.
17345	27	119	173	119	173	May Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts.
17346	27	119	174	119	174	I long for Your salvation, O LORD, and Your law is my delight.
17347	27	119	175	119	175	Let me live to praise You; may Your judgments sustain me.
17348	27	119	176	119	176	I have strayed like a lost sheep; seek Your servant, for I have not forgotten Your commandments.
17349	27	120	1	120	1	A song of ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.
17350	27	120	2	120	2	Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.
17351	27	120	3	120	3	What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?
17352	27	120	4	120	4	Sharp arrows will come from the warrior, with burning coals of the broom tree!
17353	27	120	5	120	5	Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!
17354	27	120	6	120	6	Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.
17355	27	120	7	120	7	I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
17356	27	121	1	121	1	A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come?
17357	27	121	2	121	2	My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
17358	27	121	3	121	3	He will not allow your foot to slip; your Protector will not slumber.
17359	27	121	4	121	4	Behold, the Protector of Israel will not slumber or sleep.
17360	27	121	5	121	5	The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is the shade on your right hand.
17361	27	121	6	121	6	The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
17362	27	121	7	121	7	The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul.
17363	27	121	8	121	8	The LORD will watch over your coming and going, both now and forevermore.
17364	27	122	1	122	1	A song of ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”
17365	27	122	2	122	2	Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.
17366	27	122	3	122	3	Jerusalem is built up as a city united together,
17367	27	122	4	122	4	where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
17368	27	122	5	122	5	For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.
17369	27	122	6	122	6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper.
17370	27	122	7	122	7	May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity inside your fortresses.”
17371	27	122	8	122	8	For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”
17372	27	122	9	122	9	For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
17373	27	123	1	123	1	A song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven.
17374	27	123	2	123	2	As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us mercy.
17375	27	123	3	123	3	Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have endured much contempt.
17376	27	123	4	123	4	We have endured much scorn from the arrogant, much contempt from the proud.
17377	27	124	1	124	1	A song of ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—
17378	27	124	2	124	2	if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,
17379	27	124	3	124	3	when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,
17380	27	124	4	124	4	then the floods would have engulfed us, then the torrent would have overwhelmed us,
17381	27	124	5	124	5	then the raging waters would have swept us away.
17382	27	124	6	124	6	Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
17383	27	124	7	124	7	We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.
17384	27	124	8	124	8	Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
17385	27	125	1	125	1	A song of ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever.
17386	27	125	2	125	2	As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.
17387	27	125	3	125	3	For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.
17388	27	125	4	125	4	Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart.
17389	27	125	5	125	5	But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
17390	27	126	1	126	1	A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers.
17391	27	126	2	126	2	Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”
17392	27	126	3	126	3	The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.
17393	27	126	4	126	4	Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.
17394	27	126	5	126	5	Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
17395	27	126	6	126	6	He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.
17396	27	127	1	127	1	A song of ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain; unless the LORD protects the city, its watchmen stand guard in vain.
17397	27	127	2	127	2	In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for bread to eat—for He gives sleep to His beloved.
17398	27	127	3	127	3	Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward.
17399	27	127	4	127	4	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one’s youth.
17400	27	127	5	127	5	Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
17401	27	128	1	128	1	A song of ascents. Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in His ways!
17402	27	128	2	128	2	For when you eat the fruit of your labor, blessings and prosperity will be yours.
17403	27	128	3	128	3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine flourishing within your house, your sons like olive shoots sitting around your table.
17404	27	128	4	128	4	In this way indeed shall blessing come to the man who fears the LORD.
17405	27	128	5	128	5	May the LORD bless you from Zion, that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
17406	27	128	6	128	6	that you may see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel!
17407	27	129	1	129	1	A song of ascents. Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth—let Israel now declare—
17408	27	129	2	129	2	many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed against me.
17409	27	129	3	129	3	The plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.
17410	27	129	4	129	4	The LORD is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the wicked.
17411	27	129	5	129	5	May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
17412	27	129	6	129	6	May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow,
17413	27	129	7	129	7	unable to fill the hands of the reaper, or the arms of the binder of sheaves.
17414	27	129	8	129	8	May none who pass by say to them, “The blessing of the LORD be on you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.”
17415	27	130	1	130	1	A song of ascents. Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD!
17416	27	130	2	130	2	O LORD, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.
17417	27	130	3	130	3	If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?
17418	27	130	4	130	4	But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared.
17419	27	130	5	130	5	I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope.
17420	27	130	6	130	6	My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning—more than watchmen wait for the morning.
17421	27	130	7	130	7	O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance.
17422	27	130	8	130	8	And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.
17423	27	131	1	131	1	A song of ascents. Of David. My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty. I do not aspire to great things or matters too lofty for me.
17424	27	131	2	131	2	Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
17425	27	131	3	131	3	O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forevermore.
17426	27	132	1	132	1	A song of ascents. O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,
17427	27	132	2	132	2	how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
17428	27	132	3	132	3	“I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
17429	27	132	4	132	4	I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
17430	27	132	5	132	5	until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
17431	27	132	6	132	6	We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
17432	27	132	7	132	7	Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.
17433	27	132	8	132	8	Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.
17434	27	132	9	132	9	May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.
17435	27	132	10	132	10	For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.
17436	27	132	11	132	11	The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne.
17437	27	132	12	132	12	If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.”
17438	27	132	13	132	13	For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:
17439	27	132	14	132	14	“This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home.
17440	27	132	15	132	15	I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
17441	27	132	16	132	16	I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy.
17442	27	132	17	132	17	There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
17443	27	132	18	132	18	I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam.”
17444	27	133	1	133	1	A song of ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!
17445	27	133	2	133	2	It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron’s beard over the collar of his robes.
17446	27	133	3	133	3	It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing of life forevermore.
17447	27	134	1	134	1	A song of ascents. Come, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD who serve by night in the house of the LORD!
17448	27	134	2	134	2	Lift up your hands to the sanctuary and bless the LORD!
17449	27	134	3	134	3	May the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
17450	27	135	1	135	1	Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD,
17451	27	135	2	135	2	who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
17452	27	135	3	135	3	Hallelujah, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.
17453	27	135	4	135	4	For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession.
17454	27	135	5	135	5	For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.
17455	27	135	6	135	6	The LORD does all that pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all their depths.
17456	27	135	7	135	7	He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
17457	27	135	8	135	8	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.
17458	27	135	9	135	9	He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
17459	27	135	10	135	10	He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:
17460	27	135	11	135	11	Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.
17461	27	135	12	135	12	He gave their land as an inheritance, as a heritage to His people Israel.
17462	27	135	13	135	13	Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations.
17463	27	135	14	135	14	For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants.
17464	27	135	15	135	15	The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
17465	27	135	16	135	16	They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
17466	27	135	17	135	17	they have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there breath in their mouths.
17467	27	135	18	135	18	Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.
17468	27	135	19	135	19	O house of Israel, praise the LORD; O house of Aaron, praise the LORD;
17469	27	135	20	135	20	O house of Levi, praise the LORD; you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD!
17470	27	135	21	135	21	Blessed be the LORD from Zion—He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
17471	27	136	1	136	1	Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His loving devotion endures forever.
17472	27	136	2	136	2	Give thanks to the God of gods. His loving devotion endures forever.
17473	27	136	3	136	3	Give thanks to the Lord of lords. His loving devotion endures forever.
17474	27	136	4	136	4	He alone does great wonders. His loving devotion endures forever.
17475	27	136	5	136	5	By His insight He made the heavens. His loving devotion endures forever.
17476	27	136	6	136	6	He spread out the earth upon the waters. His loving devotion endures forever.
17477	27	136	7	136	7	He made the great lights—His loving devotion endures forever.
17478	27	136	8	136	8	the sun to rule the day, His loving devotion endures forever.
17479	27	136	9	136	9	the moon and stars to govern the night. His loving devotion endures forever.
17480	27	136	10	136	10	He struck down the firstborn of Egypt His loving devotion endures forever.
17481	27	136	11	136	11	and brought Israel out from among them His loving devotion endures forever.
17482	27	136	12	136	12	with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. His loving devotion endures forever.
17483	27	136	13	136	13	He divided the Red Sea in two His loving devotion endures forever.
17484	27	136	14	136	14	and led Israel through the midst, His loving devotion endures forever.
17485	27	136	15	136	15	but swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea. His loving devotion endures forever.
17486	27	136	16	136	16	He led His people through the wilderness. His loving devotion endures forever.
17487	27	136	17	136	17	He struck down great kings His loving devotion endures forever.
17488	27	136	18	136	18	and slaughtered mighty kings—His loving devotion endures forever.
17489	27	136	19	136	19	Sihon king of the Amorites His loving devotion endures forever.
17490	27	136	20	136	20	and Og king of Bashan—His loving devotion endures forever.
17491	27	136	21	136	21	and He gave their land as an inheritance, His loving devotion endures forever.
17492	27	136	22	136	22	a heritage to His servant Israel. His loving devotion endures forever.
17493	27	136	23	136	23	He remembered us in our low estate His loving devotion endures forever.
17494	27	136	24	136	24	and freed us from our enemies. His loving devotion endures forever.
17495	27	136	25	136	25	He gives food to every creature. His loving devotion endures forever.
17496	27	136	26	136	26	Give thanks to the God of heaven! His loving devotion endures forever.
17497	27	137	1	137	1	By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.
17498	27	137	2	137	2	There on the willows we hung our harps,
17499	27	137	3	137	3	for there our captors requested a song; our tormentors demanded songs of joy: “Sing us a song of Zion.”
17500	27	137	4	137	4	How can we sing a song of the LORD in a foreign land?
17501	27	137	5	137	5	If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand cease to function.
17502	27	137	6	137	6	May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!
17503	27	137	7	137	7	Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem fell: “Destroy it,” they said, “tear it down to its foundations!”
17504	27	137	8	137	8	O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, blessed is he who repays you as you have done to us.
17505	27	137	9	137	9	Blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
17506	27	138	1	138	1	Of David. I give You thanks with all my heart; before the gods I sing Your praises.
17507	27	138	2	138	2	I bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness; You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else.
17508	27	138	3	138	3	On the day I called, You answered me; You emboldened me and strengthened my soul.
17509	27	138	4	138	4	All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth.
17510	27	138	5	138	5	They will sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great.
17511	27	138	6	138	6	Though the LORD is on high, He attends to the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar.
17512	27	138	7	138	7	If I walk in the midst of trouble, You preserve me from the anger of my foes; You extend Your hand, and Your right hand saves me.
17513	27	138	8	138	8	The LORD will fulfill His purpose for me. O LORD, Your loving devotion endures forever—do not abandon the works of Your hands.
17514	27	139	1	139	1	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O LORD, You have searched me and known me.
17515	27	139	2	139	2	You know when I sit and when I rise; You understand my thoughts from afar.
17516	27	139	3	139	3	You search out my path and my lying down; You are aware of all my ways.
17517	27	139	4	139	4	Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, O LORD.
17518	27	139	5	139	5	You hem me in behind and before; You have laid Your hand upon me.
17519	27	139	6	139	6	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.
17520	27	139	7	139	7	Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?
17521	27	139	8	139	8	If I ascend to the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.
17522	27	139	9	139	9	If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle by the farthest sea,
17523	27	139	10	139	10	even there Your hand will guide me; Your right hand will hold me fast.
17524	27	139	11	139	11	If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light become night around me”—
17525	27	139	12	139	12	even the darkness is not dark to You, but the night shines like the day, for darkness is as light to You.
17526	27	139	13	139	13	For You formed my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
17527	27	139	14	139	14	I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are Your works, and I know this very well.
17528	27	139	15	139	15	My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
17529	27	139	16	139	16	Your eyes saw my unformed body; all my days were written in Your book and ordained for me before one of them came to be.
17530	27	139	17	139	17	How precious to me are Your thoughts, O God, how vast is their sum!
17531	27	139	18	139	18	If I were to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; and when I awake, I am still with You.
17532	27	139	19	139	19	O God, that You would slay the wicked—away from me, you bloodthirsty men—
17533	27	139	20	139	20	who speak of You deceitfully; Your enemies take Your name in vain.
17534	27	139	21	139	21	Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD, and detest those who rise against You?
17535	27	139	22	139	22	I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them as my enemies.
17536	27	139	23	139	23	Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.
17537	27	139	24	139	24	See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the way everlasting.
17538	27	140	1	140	0	For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
17539	27	140	2	140	1	Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence,
17540	27	140	3	140	2	who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long.
17541	27	140	4	140	3	They sharpen their tongues like snakes; the venom of vipers is on their lips. Selah
17542	27	140	5	140	4	Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble.
17543	27	140	6	140	5	The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. Selah
17544	27	140	7	140	6	I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Hear, O LORD, my cry for help.
17545	27	140	8	140	7	O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle.
17546	27	140	9	140	8	Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah
17547	27	140	10	140	9	May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.
17548	27	140	11	140	10	May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again.
17549	27	140	12	140	11	May no slanderer be established in the land; may calamity hunt down the man of violence.
17550	27	140	13	140	12	I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy.
17551	27	140	14	140	13	Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.
17552	27	141	1	141	1	A Psalm of David. I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.
17553	27	141	2	141	2	May my prayer be set before You like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering.
17554	27	141	3	141	3	Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.
17555	27	141	4	141	4	Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.
17556	27	141	5	141	5	Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.
17557	27	141	6	141	6	When their rulers are thrown from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.
17558	27	141	7	141	7	As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
17559	27	141	8	141	8	But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.
17560	27	141	9	141	9	Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers.
17561	27	141	10	141	10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
17562	27	142	1	142	0	A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer. 
17563	27	142	2	142	1	I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy.
17564	27	142	3	142	2	I pour out my complaint before Him; I reveal my trouble to Him.
17565	27	142	4	142	3	Although my spirit grows faint within me, You know my way. Along the path I travel they have hidden a snare for me.
17566	27	142	5	142	4	Look to my right and see; no one attends to me. There is no refuge for me; no one cares for my soul.
17567	27	142	6	142	5	I cry to You, O LORD: “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”
17568	27	142	7	142	6	Listen to my cry, for I am brought quite low. Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are too strong for me.
17569	27	142	8	142	7	Free my soul from prison, that I may praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness to me.
17570	27	143	1	143	1	A Psalm of David. O LORD, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea; in Your righteousness, answer me.
17571	27	143	2	143	2	Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.
17572	27	143	3	143	3	For the enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life to the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.
17573	27	143	4	143	4	My spirit grows faint within me; my heart is dismayed inside me.
17574	27	143	5	143	5	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I consider the work of Your hands.
17575	27	143	6	143	6	I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for You like a parched land. Selah
17576	27	143	7	143	7	Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who descend to the Pit.
17577	27	143	8	143	8	Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning, for I have put my trust in You. Teach me the way I should walk, for to You I lift up my soul.
17578	27	143	9	143	9	Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD; I flee to You for refuge.
17579	27	143	10	143	10	Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
17580	27	143	11	143	11	For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
17581	27	143	12	143	12	And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies. Destroy all who afflict me, for I am Your servant.
17582	27	144	1	144	1	Of David. Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.
17583	27	144	2	144	2	He is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.
17584	27	144	3	144	3	O LORD, what is man, that You regard him, the son of man that You think of him?
17585	27	144	4	144	4	Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.
17586	27	144	5	144	5	Part Your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
17587	27	144	6	144	6	Flash forth Your lightning and scatter them; shoot Your arrows and rout them.
17588	27	144	7	144	7	Reach down from on high; set me free and rescue me from the deep waters, from the grasp of foreigners,
17589	27	144	8	144	8	whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.
17590	27	144	9	144	9	I will sing to You a new song, O God; on a harp of ten strings I will make music to You—
17591	27	144	10	144	10	to Him who gives victory to kings, who frees His servant David from the deadly sword.
17592	27	144	11	144	11	Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners, whose mouths speak falsehood, whose right hands are deceitful.
17593	27	144	12	144	12	Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars carved to adorn a palace.
17594	27	144	13	144	13	Our storehouses will be full, supplying all manner of produce; our flocks will bring forth thousands, tens of thousands in our fields.
17595	27	144	14	144	14	Our oxen will bear great loads. There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our streets.
17596	27	144	15	144	15	Blessed are the people of whom this is so; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.
17597	27	145	1	145	1	A Psalm of praise. Of David. I will exalt You, my God and King; I will bless Your name forever and ever.
17598	27	145	2	145	2	Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.
17599	27	145	3	145	3	Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable.
17600	27	145	4	145	4	One generation will commend Your works to the next, and will proclaim Your mighty acts—
17601	27	145	5	145	5	the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works.
17602	27	145	6	145	6	They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds, and I will declare Your greatness.
17603	27	145	7	145	7	They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness and sing joyfully of Your righteousness.
17604	27	145	8	145	8	The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion.
17605	27	145	9	145	9	The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made.
17606	27	145	10	145	10	All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD, and Your saints will bless You.
17607	27	145	11	145	11	They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom and speak of Your might,
17608	27	145	12	145	12	to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.
17609	27	145	13	145	13	Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions.
17610	27	145	14	145	14	The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
17611	27	145	15	145	15	The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season.
17612	27	145	16	145	16	You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
17613	27	145	17	145	17	The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds.
17614	27	145	18	145	18	The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call out to Him in truth.
17615	27	145	19	145	19	He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them.
17616	27	145	20	145	20	The LORD preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.
17617	27	145	21	145	21	My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD; let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
17618	27	146	1	146	1	Hallelujah! Praise the LORD, O my soul.
17619	27	146	2	146	2	I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
17620	27	146	3	146	3	Put not your trust in princes, in mortal man, who cannot save.
17621	27	146	4	146	4	When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.
17622	27	146	5	146	5	Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,
17623	27	146	6	146	6	the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever.
17624	27	146	7	146	7	He executes justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free,
17625	27	146	8	146	8	the LORD opens the eyes of the blind, the LORD lifts those who are weighed down, the LORD loves the righteous.
17626	27	146	9	146	9	The LORD protects foreigners; He sustains the fatherless and the widow, but the ways of the wicked He frustrates.
17627	27	146	10	146	10	The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah!
17628	27	147	1	147	1	Hallelujah! How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!
17629	27	147	2	147	2	The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the exiles of Israel.
17630	27	147	3	147	3	He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
17631	27	147	4	147	4	He determines the number of the stars; He calls them each by name.
17632	27	147	5	147	5	Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit.
17633	27	147	6	147	6	The LORD sustains the humble, but casts the wicked to the ground.
17634	27	147	7	147	7	Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music on the harp to our God,
17635	27	147	8	147	8	who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the hills.
17636	27	147	9	147	9	He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.
17637	27	147	10	147	10	He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legpower of the man.
17638	27	147	11	147	11	The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him, who hope in His loving devotion.
17639	27	147	12	147	12	Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion!
17640	27	147	13	147	13	For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses the children within you.
17641	27	147	14	147	14	He makes peace at your borders; He fills you with the finest wheat.
17642	27	147	15	147	15	He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.
17643	27	147	16	147	16	He spreads the snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;
17644	27	147	17	147	17	He casts forth His hail like pebbles. Who can withstand His icy blast?
17645	27	147	18	147	18	He sends forth His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.
17646	27	147	19	147	19	He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.
17647	27	147	20	147	20	He has done this for no other nation; they do not know His judgments. Hallelujah!
17648	27	148	1	148	1	Hallelujah! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places.
17649	27	148	2	148	2	Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.

17652	27	148	5	148	5	Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created.
17653	27	148	6	148	6	He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.
17654	27	148	7	148	7	Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths,
17655	27	148	8	148	8	lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word,
17656	27	148	9	148	9	mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
17657	27	148	10	148	10	wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds,
17658	27	148	11	148	11	kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth,
17659	27	148	12	148	12	young men and maidens, old and young together.
17660	27	148	13	148	13	Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
17661	27	148	14	148	14	He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
17662	27	149	1	149	1	Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new song—His praise in the assembly of the godly.
17663	27	149	2	149	2	Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.
17664	27	149	3	149	3	Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.
17665	27	149	4	149	4	For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation.
17666	27	149	5	149	5	Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.
17667	27	149	6	149	6	May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands,
17668	27	149	7	149	7	to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
17669	27	149	8	149	8	to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with shackles of iron,
17670	27	149	9	149	9	to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!
17671	27	150	1	150	1	Hallelujah! Praise God in His sanctuary. Praise Him in His mighty heavens.
17672	27	150	2	150	2	Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His excellent greatness.
17673	27	150	3	150	3	Praise Him with the sound of the horn; praise Him with the harp and lyre.
17674	27	150	4	150	4	Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; praise Him with strings and flute.
17675	27	150	5	150	5	Praise Him with clashing cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals.
17676	27	150	6	150	6	Let everything that has breath praise the LORD! Hallelujah!

17682	28	1	6	1	6	and to understand the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.
17683	28	1	7	1	7	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
17684	28	1	8	1	8	Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
17685	28	1	9	1	9	For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck.
17686	28	1	10	1	10	My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them.
17687	28	1	11	1	11	If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause,
17688	28	1	12	1	12	let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.
17689	28	1	13	1	13	We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder.
17690	28	1	14	1	14	Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—
17691	28	1	15	1	15	my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.
17692	28	1	16	1	16	For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood.
17693	28	1	17	1	17	How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it.
17694	28	1	18	1	18	But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.
17695	28	1	19	1	19	Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.
17696	28	1	20	1	20	Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;
17697	28	1	21	1	21	in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:
17698	28	1	22	1	22	“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?
17699	28	1	23	1	23	If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.
17700	28	1	24	1	24	Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,
17701	28	1	25	1	25	because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,
17702	28	1	26	1	26	in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,
17703	28	1	27	1	27	when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.
17704	28	1	28	1	28	Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.
17705	28	1	29	1	29	For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.
17706	28	1	30	1	30	They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.
17707	28	1	31	1	31	So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
17708	28	1	32	1	32	For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
17709	28	1	33	1	33	But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”
17710	28	2	1	2	1	My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,
17711	28	2	2	2	2	if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,
17712	28	2	3	2	3	if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,
17713	28	2	4	2	4	if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,
17714	28	2	5	2	5	then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.
17715	28	2	6	2	6	For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
17716	28	2	7	2	7	He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,
17717	28	2	8	2	8	to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.
17718	28	2	9	2	9	Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equity—every good path.
17719	28	2	10	2	10	For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.
17720	28	2	11	2	11	Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,
17721	28	2	12	2	12	to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,
17722	28	2	13	2	13	from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,
17723	28	2	14	2	14	from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,
17724	28	2	15	2	15	whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.
17725	28	2	16	2	16	It will rescue you from the forbidden woman, from the stranger with seductive words
17726	28	2	17	2	17	who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
17727	28	2	18	2	18	For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.
17728	28	2	19	2	19	None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.
17729	28	2	20	2	20	So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.
17730	28	2	21	2	21	For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
17731	28	2	22	2	22	but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
17732	28	3	1	3	1	My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;
17733	28	3	2	3	2	for they will add length to your days, years and peace to your life.
17734	28	3	3	3	3	Never let loving devotion or faithfulness leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
17735	28	3	4	3	4	Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
17736	28	3	5	3	5	Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;
17737	28	3	6	3	6	in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.
17738	28	3	7	3	7	Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.
17739	28	3	8	3	8	This will bring healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.
17740	28	3	9	3	9	Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest;
17741	28	3	10	3	10	then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
17742	28	3	11	3	11	My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His rebuke;
17743	28	3	12	3	12	for the LORD disciplines the one He loves, as does a father the son in whom he delights.
17744	28	3	13	3	13	Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who acquires understanding,
17745	28	3	14	3	14	for she is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than fine gold.
17746	28	3	15	3	15	She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her.
17747	28	3	16	3	16	Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
17748	28	3	17	3	17	All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
17749	28	3	18	3	18	She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who lay hold of her are blessed.
17750	28	3	19	3	19	The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.
17751	28	3	20	3	20	By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open, and the clouds dripped with dew.
17752	28	3	21	3	21	My son, do not lose sight of this: Preserve sound judgment and discernment.
17753	28	3	22	3	22	They will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.
17754	28	3	23	3	23	Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble.
17755	28	3	24	3	24	When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you rest, your sleep will be sweet.
17756	28	3	25	3	25	Do not fear sudden danger or the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
17757	28	3	26	3	26	for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from the snare.
17758	28	3	27	3	27	Do not withhold good from the deserving when it is within your power to act.
17759	28	3	28	3	28	Do not tell your neighbor, “Come back tomorrow and I will provide”—when you already have the means.
17760	28	3	29	3	29	Do not devise evil against your neighbor, for he trustfully dwells beside you.
17761	28	3	30	3	30	Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm.
17762	28	3	31	3	31	Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;
17763	28	3	32	3	32	for the LORD detests the perverse, but He is a friend to the upright.
17764	28	3	33	3	33	The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.
17765	28	3	34	3	34	He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.
17766	28	3	35	3	35	The wise will inherit honor, but fools are held up to shame.
17767	28	4	1	4	1	Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.
17768	28	4	2	4	2	For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive.
17769	28	4	3	4	3	When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother,
17770	28	4	4	4	4	he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live.
17771	28	4	5	4	5	Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them.
17772	28	4	6	4	6	Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you.
17773	28	4	7	4	7	Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire, gain understanding.
17774	28	4	8	4	8	Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.
17775	28	4	9	4	9	She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.”
17776	28	4	10	4	10	Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.
17777	28	4	11	4	11	I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths.
17778	28	4	12	4	12	When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble.
17779	28	4	13	4	13	Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life.
17780	28	4	14	4	14	Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.
17781	28	4	15	4	15	Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by.
17782	28	4	16	4	16	For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.
17783	28	4	17	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
17784	28	4	18	4	18	The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.
17785	28	4	19	4	19	But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble.
17786	28	4	20	4	20	My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
17787	28	4	21	4	21	Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.
17788	28	4	22	4	22	For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body.
17789	28	4	23	4	23	Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.
17790	28	4	24	4	24	Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech.
17791	28	4	25	4	25	Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.
17792	28	4	26	4	26	Make a level path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure.
17793	28	4	27	4	27	Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.
17794	28	5	1	5	1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,
17795	28	5	2	5	2	that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.
17796	28	5	3	5	3	Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil,
17797	28	5	4	5	4	her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.
17798	28	5	5	5	5	Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.
17799	28	5	6	5	6	She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.
17800	28	5	7	5	7	So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.
17801	28	5	8	5	8	Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,
17802	28	5	9	5	9	lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;
17803	28	5	10	5	10	lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.
17804	28	5	11	5	11	At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,
17805	28	5	12	5	12	and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
17806	28	5	13	5	13	I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.
17807	28	5	14	5	14	I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”
17808	28	5	15	5	15	Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.
17809	28	5	16	5	16	Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
17810	28	5	17	5	17	Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
17811	28	5	18	5	18	May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:
17812	28	5	19	5	19	A loving doe, a graceful fawn—may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated by her love forever.
17813	28	5	20	5	20	Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?
17814	28	5	21	5	21	For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.
17815	28	5	22	5	22	The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.
17816	28	5	23	5	23	He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.
17817	28	6	1	6	1	My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,
17818	28	6	2	6	2	if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,
17819	28	6	3	6	3	then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.
17820	28	6	4	6	4	Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
17821	28	6	5	6	5	Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
17822	28	6	6	6	6	Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.
17823	28	6	7	6	7	Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,
17824	28	6	8	6	8	it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.
17825	28	6	9	6	9	How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?
17826	28	6	10	6	10	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
17827	28	6	11	6	11	and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
17828	28	6	12	6	12	A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,
17829	28	6	13	6	13	winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.
17830	28	6	14	6	14	With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.
17831	28	6	15	6	15	Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.
17832	28	6	16	6	16	There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:
17833	28	6	17	6	17	haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
17834	28	6	18	6	18	a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,
17835	28	6	19	6	19	a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.
17836	28	6	20	6	20	My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
17837	28	6	21	6	21	Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.
17838	28	6	22	6	22	When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.
17839	28	6	23	6	23	For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,
17840	28	6	24	6	24	to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
17841	28	6	25	6	25	Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.
17842	28	6	26	6	26	For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
17843	28	6	27	6	27	Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?
17844	28	6	28	6	28	Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?
17845	28	6	29	6	29	So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
17846	28	6	30	6	30	Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.
17847	28	6	31	6	31	Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.
17848	28	6	32	6	32	He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.
17849	28	6	33	6	33	Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.
17850	28	6	34	6	34	For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.
17851	28	6	35	6	35	He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.
17852	28	7	1	7	1	My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.
17853	28	7	2	7	2	Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
17854	28	7	3	7	3	Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
17855	28	7	4	7	4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,
17856	28	7	5	7	5	that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.
17857	28	7	6	7	6	For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.
17858	28	7	7	7	7	I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,
17859	28	7	8	7	8	crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,
17860	28	7	9	7	9	at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.
17861	28	7	10	7	10	Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.
17862	28	7	11	7	11	She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.
17863	28	7	12	7	12	Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.
17864	28	7	13	7	13	She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:
17865	28	7	14	7	14	“I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.
17866	28	7	15	7	15	So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.
17867	28	7	16	7	16	I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.
17868	28	7	17	7	17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.
17869	28	7	18	7	18	Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!
17870	28	7	19	7	19	For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
17871	28	7	20	7	20	He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”
17872	28	7	21	7	21	With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.
17873	28	7	22	7	22	He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,
17874	28	7	23	7	23	until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare—not knowing it will cost him his life.
17875	28	7	24	7	24	Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
17876	28	7	25	7	25	Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.
17877	28	7	26	7	26	For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.
17878	28	7	27	7	27	Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
17879	28	8	1	8	1	Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?
17880	28	8	2	8	2	On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.
17881	28	8	3	8	3	Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:
17882	28	8	4	8	4	“To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men.
17883	28	8	5	8	5	O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding.
17884	28	8	6	8	6	Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right.
17885	28	8	7	8	7	For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
17886	28	8	8	8	8	All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse.
17887	28	8	9	8	9	They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge.
17888	28	8	10	8	10	Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.
17889	28	8	11	8	11	For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.
17890	28	8	12	8	12	I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.

18197	28	18	20	18	20	From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled; with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.
18198	28	18	21	18	21	Life and death are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

18226	28	19	25	19	25	Strike a mocker, and the simple will beware; rebuke the discerning man, and he will gain knowledge.
18227	28	19	26	19	26	He who assaults his father or evicts his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace.

18238	28	20	8	20	8	A king who sits on a throne to judge sifts out all evil with his eyes.
18239	28	20	9	20	9	Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure; I am cleansed from my sin”?

18245	28	20	15	20	15	There is an abundance of gold and rubies, but lips of knowledge are a rare treasure.
18246	28	20	16	20	16	Take the garment of the one who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.

18254	28	20	24	20	24	A man’s steps are from the LORD, so how can anyone understand his own way?
18255	28	20	25	20	25	It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly, only later to reconsider his vows.

18282	28	21	22	21	22	A wise man scales the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.
18283	28	21	23	21	23	He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.
18284	28	21	24	21	24	Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man—of him who acts with excessive pride.
18285	28	21	25	21	25	The craving of the slacker kills him because his hands refuse to work.
18286	28	21	26	21	26	All day long he covets more, but the righteous give without restraint.
18287	28	21	27	21	27	The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—how much more so when brought with ill intent!
18288	28	21	28	21	28	A lying witness will perish, but the man who listens to truth will speak forever.
18289	28	21	29	21	29	A wicked man hardens his face, but the upright man makes his way sure.
18290	28	21	30	21	30	There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.
18291	28	21	31	21	31	A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.
18292	28	22	1	22	1	A good name is more desirable than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold.
18293	28	22	2	22	2	The rich and the poor have this in common: the LORD is Maker of them all.
18294	28	22	3	22	3	The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.
18295	28	22	4	22	4	The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD are wealth and honor and life.
18296	28	22	5	22	5	Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul stays far from them.
18297	28	22	6	22	6	Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.
18298	28	22	7	22	7	The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.
18299	28	22	8	22	8	He who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
18300	28	22	9	22	9	A generous man will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.
18301	28	22	10	22	10	Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart; even quarreling and insults will cease.
18302	28	22	11	22	11	He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips will have the king for a friend.
18303	28	22	12	22	12	The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He frustrates the words of the faithless.
18304	28	22	13	22	13	The slacker says, “There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!”
18305	28	22	14	22	14	The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the wrath of the LORD will fall into it.
18306	28	22	15	22	15	Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
18307	28	22	16	22	16	Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich will surely lead to poverty.
18308	28	22	17	22	17	Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise—apply your mind to my knowledge—
18309	28	22	18	22	18	for it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips.
18310	28	22	19	22	19	So that your trust may be in the LORD, I instruct you today—yes, you.
18311	28	22	20	22	20	Have I not written for you thirty sayings about counsel and knowledge,
18312	28	22	21	22	21	to show you true and reliable words, that you may soundly answer those who sent you?
18313	28	22	22	22	22	Do not rob a poor man because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,
18314	28	22	23	22	23	for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who rob them.
18315	28	22	24	22	24	Do not make friends with an angry man, and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,
18316	28	22	25	22	25	or you may learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.
18317	28	22	26	22	26	Do not be one who gives pledges, who puts up security for debts.
18318	28	22	27	22	27	If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?
18319	28	22	28	22	28	Do not move an ancient boundary stone which your fathers have placed.
18320	28	22	29	22	29	Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will be stationed in the presence of kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
18321	28	23	1	23	1	When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is set before you,
18322	28	23	2	23	2	and put a knife to your throat if you possess a great appetite.
18323	28	23	3	23	3	Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.
18324	28	23	4	23	4	Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself.
18325	28	23	5	23	5	When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky.
18326	28	23	6	23	6	Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, and do not crave his delicacies;
18327	28	23	7	23	7	for he is keeping track, inwardly counting the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
18328	28	23	8	23	8	You will vomit up what little you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.
18329	28	23	9	23	9	Do not speak to a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
18330	28	23	10	23	10	Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
18331	28	23	11	23	11	for their Redeemer is strong; He will take up their case against you.
18332	28	23	12	23	12	Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.
18333	28	23	13	23	13	Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with a rod, he will not die.
18334	28	23	14	23	14	Strike him with a rod, and you will deliver his soul from Sheol.
18335	28	23	15	23	15	My son, if your heart is wise, my own heart will indeed rejoice.
18336	28	23	16	23	16	My inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
18337	28	23	17	23	17	Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.
18338	28	23	18	23	18	For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
18339	28	23	19	23	19	Listen, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right course.
18340	28	23	20	23	20	Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat.
18341	28	23	21	23	21	For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.
18342	28	23	22	23	22	Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
18343	28	23	23	23	23	Invest in truth and never sell it—in wisdom and instruction and understanding.
18344	28	23	24	23	24	The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.
18345	28	23	25	23	25	May your father and mother be glad, and may she who gave you birth rejoice!
18346	28	23	26	23	26	My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways.
18347	28	23	27	23	27	For a prostitute is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well.
18348	28	23	28	23	28	Like a robber she lies in wait and multiplies the faithless among men.
18349	28	23	29	23	29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has needless wounds? Who has bloodshot eyes?
18350	28	23	30	23	30	Those who linger over wine, those who go to taste mixed drinks.
18351	28	23	31	23	31	Do not gaze at wine while it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.
18352	28	23	32	23	32	In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.
18353	28	23	33	23	33	Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will utter perversities.
18354	28	23	34	23	34	You will be like one sleeping on the high seas or lying on the top of a mast:
18355	28	23	35	23	35	“They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I did not know it! When can I wake up to search for another drink?”
18356	28	24	1	24	1	Do not envy wicked men or desire their company;
18357	28	24	2	24	2	for their hearts devise violence, and their lips declare trouble.
18358	28	24	3	24	3	By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established;
18359	28	24	4	24	4	through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.
18360	28	24	5	24	5	A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge enhances his strength.
18361	28	24	6	24	6	Only with sound guidance should you wage war, and victory lies in a multitude of counselors.
18362	28	24	7	24	7	Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.
18363	28	24	8	24	8	He who plots evil will be called a schemer.
18364	28	24	9	24	9	A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to men.
18365	28	24	10	24	10	If you faint in the day of distress, how small is your strength!
18366	28	24	11	24	11	Rescue those being led away to death, and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter.
18367	28	24	12	24	12	If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” does not He who weighs hearts consider it? Does not the One who guards your life know? Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?
18368	28	24	13	24	13	Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
18369	28	24	14	24	14	Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there is a future for you, and your hope will never be cut off.
18370	28	24	15	24	15	Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place.
18371	28	24	16	24	16	For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; but the wicked stumble in bad times.
18372	28	24	17	24	17	Do not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,
18373	28	24	18	24	18	or the LORD will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from him.
18374	28	24	19	24	19	Do not fret over evildoers, and do not be envious of the wicked.
18375	28	24	20	24	20	For the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
18376	28	24	21	24	21	My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not associate with the rebellious.
18377	28	24	22	24	22	For those two will bring sudden destruction; who knows what ruin they can bring?
18378	28	24	23	24	23	These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.
18379	28	24	24	24	24	Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”—peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him;
18380	28	24	25	24	25	but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.
18381	28	24	26	24	26	An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips.
18382	28	24	27	24	27	Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; after that, you may build your house.
18383	28	24	28	24	28	Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.
18384	28	24	29	24	29	Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his work.”
18385	28	24	30	24	30	I went past the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.
18386	28	24	31	24	31	Thorns had grown up everywhere, thistles had covered the ground, and the stone wall was broken down.
18387	28	24	32	24	32	I observed and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction:
18388	28	24	33	24	33	A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
18389	28	24	34	24	34	and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.
18390	28	25	1	25	1	These are additional proverbs of Solomon, which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
18391	28	25	2	25	2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to search it out.
18392	28	25	3	25	3	As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings cannot be searched.
18393	28	25	4	25	4	Remove the dross from the silver, and a vessel for a silversmith will come forth.
18394	28	25	5	25	5	Remove the wicked from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness.
18395	28	25	6	25	6	Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of great men;
18396	28	25	7	25	7	for it is better that he says to you, “Come up here!” than that you should be demoted in the presence of the prince. Even what you have seen with your own eyes,
18397	28	25	8	25	8	do not go out to argue in haste. Otherwise, what will you do in the end when your opponent puts you to shame?
18398	28	25	9	25	9	Argue your case with your neighbor without betraying another’s confidence,
18399	28	25	10	25	10	lest the one who hears may disgrace you, and your infamy never go away.
18400	28	25	11	25	11	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
18401	28	25	12	25	12	Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man’s rebuke to a listening ear.
18402	28	25	13	25	13	Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters.
18403	28	25	14	25	14	Like clouds and wind without rain is the man who boasts of gifts never given.
18404	28	25	15	25	15	Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
18405	28	25	16	25	16	If you find honey, eat just what you need, lest you have too much and vomit it up.
18406	28	25	17	25	17	Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house, lest he grow weary and hate you.
18407	28	25	18	25	18	Like a club or sword or sharp arrow is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor.
18408	28	25	19	25	19	Like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.
18409	28	25	20	25	20	Like one who removes a garment on a cold day or vinegar poured on a wound is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
18410	28	25	21	25	21	If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
18411	28	25	22	25	22	For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.
18412	28	25	23	25	23	As the north wind brings forth rain, so a backbiting tongue brings angry looks.
18413	28	25	24	25	24	Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
18414	28	25	25	25	25	Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land.
18415	28	25	26	25	26	Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked.
18416	28	25	27	25	27	It is not good to eat too much honey or to search out one’s own glory.
18417	28	25	28	25	28	Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who does not control his temper.
18418	28	26	1	26	1	Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor does not befit a fool.
18419	28	26	2	26	2	Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
18420	28	26	3	26	3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!
18421	28	26	4	26	4	Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be like him.
18422	28	26	5	26	5	Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.
18423	28	26	6	26	6	Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.
18424	28	26	7	26	7	Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
18425	28	26	8	26	8	Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.
18426	28	26	9	26	9	Like a thorn that falls into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
18427	28	26	10	26	10	Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passerby.
18428	28	26	11	26	11	As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.
18429	28	26	12	26	12	Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
18430	28	26	13	26	13	The slacker says, “A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!”
18431	28	26	14	26	14	As a door turns on its hinges, so the slacker turns on his bed.
18432	28	26	15	26	15	The slacker buries his hand in the dish; it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.
18433	28	26	16	26	16	The slacker is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.
18434	28	26	17	26	17	Like one who grabs a dog by the ears is a passerby who meddles in a quarrel not his own.
18435	28	26	18	26	18	Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,
18436	28	26	19	26	19	so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”
18437	28	26	20	26	20	Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.
18438	28	26	21	26	21	Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
18439	28	26	22	26	22	The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down to the inmost being.
18440	28	26	23	26	23	Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning lips and a wicked heart.
18441	28	26	24	26	24	A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.
18442	28	26	25	26	25	When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.
18443	28	26	26	26	26	Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
18444	28	26	27	26	27	He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.
18445	28	26	28	26	28	A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
18446	28	27	1	27	1	Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
18447	28	27	2	27	2	Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—a stranger, and not your own lips.
18448	28	27	3	27	3	A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.
18449	28	27	4	27	4	Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?
18450	28	27	5	27	5	Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.
18451	28	27	6	27	6	The wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
18452	28	27	7	27	7	The soul that is full loathes honey, but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.
18453	28	27	8	27	8	Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who wanders from his home.
18454	28	27	9	27	9	Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is counsel to the soul.
18455	28	27	10	27	10	Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
18456	28	27	11	27	11	Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, so that I can answer him who taunts me.
18457	28	27	12	27	12	The prudent see danger and take cover; but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
18458	28	27	13	27	13	Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.
18459	28	27	14	27	14	If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted to him as a curse.
18460	28	27	15	27	15	A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—
18461	28	27	16	27	16	restraining her is like holding back the wind or grasping oil with one’s right hand.
18462	28	27	17	27	17	As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.
18463	28	27	18	27	18	Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.
18464	28	27	19	27	19	As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the true man.
18465	28	27	20	27	20	Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
18466	28	27	21	27	21	A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.
18467	28	27	22	27	22	Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, yet his folly will not depart from him.
18468	28	27	23	27	23	Be sure to know the state of your flocks, and pay close attention to your herds;
18469	28	27	24	27	24	for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to every generation.
18470	28	27	25	27	25	When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grain from the hills is gathered,
18471	28	27	26	27	26	the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.
18472	28	27	27	27	27	You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—food for your household and nourishment for your maidservants.
18473	28	28	1	28	1	The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
18474	28	28	2	28	2	A land in rebellion has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.
18475	28	28	3	28	3	A destitute leader who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food.
18476	28	28	4	28	4	Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them.
18477	28	28	5	28	5	Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.
18478	28	28	6	28	6	Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a rich man whose ways are perverse.
18479	28	28	7	28	7	A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.
18480	28	28	8	28	8	He who increases his wealth by interest and usury lays it up for one who is kind to the poor.
18481	28	28	9	28	9	Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law, even his prayer is detestable.
18482	28	28	10	28	10	He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good.
18483	28	28	11	28	11	A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man with discernment sees through him.
18484	28	28	12	28	12	When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
18485	28	28	13	28	13	He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.
18486	28	28	14	28	14	Blessed is the man who is always reverent, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
18487	28	28	15	28	15	Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.
18488	28	28	16	28	16	A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor, but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong his days.
18489	28	28	17	28	17	A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit; let no one support him.
18490	28	28	18	28	18	He who walks with integrity will be kept safe, but whoever is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.
18491	28	28	19	28	19	The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
18492	28	28	20	28	20	A faithful man will abound with blessings, but one eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
18493	28	28	21	28	21	To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
18494	28	28	22	28	22	A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty awaits him.
18495	28	28	23	28	23	He who rebukes a man will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.
18496	28	28	24	28	24	He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,” is a companion to the man who destroys.
18497	28	28	25	28	25	A greedy man stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.
18498	28	28	26	28	26	He who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.
18499	28	28	27	28	27	Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need, but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.
18500	28	28	28	28	28	When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous flourish.
18501	28	29	1	29	1	A man who remains stiff-necked after much reproof will suddenly be shattered beyond recovery.
18502	28	29	2	29	2	When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
18503	28	29	3	29	3	A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
18504	28	29	4	29	4	By justice a king brings stability to the land, but a man who exacts tribute demolishes it.
18505	28	29	5	29	5	A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
18506	28	29	6	29	6	An evil man is caught by his own sin, but a righteous one sings and rejoices.
18507	28	29	7	29	7	The righteous consider the cause of the poor, but the wicked have no regard for such concerns.
18508	28	29	8	29	8	Mockers inflame a city, but the wise turn away anger.
18509	28	29	9	29	9	If a wise man goes to court with a fool, there will be raving and laughing with no resolution.
18510	28	29	10	29	10	Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man, but the upright care for his life.
18511	28	29	11	29	11	A fool vents all his anger, but a wise man holds it back.
18512	28	29	12	29	12	If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials will be wicked.
18513	28	29	13	29	13	The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both.
18514	28	29	14	29	14	A king who judges the poor with fairness—his throne will be established forever.
18515	28	29	15	29	15	A rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother.
18516	28	29	16	29	16	When the wicked thrive, rebellion increases; but the righteous will see their downfall.
18517	28	29	17	29	17	Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will bring delight to your soul.
18518	28	29	18	29	18	Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the Law.
18519	28	29	19	29	19	A servant cannot be corrected by words alone; though he understands, he will not respond.
18520	28	29	20	29	20	Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
18521	28	29	21	29	21	A servant pampered from his youth will bring grief in the end.
18522	28	29	22	29	22	An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
18523	28	29	23	29	23	A man’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.
18524	28	29	24	29	24	A partner to a thief hates his own soul; he receives the oath, but does not testify.
18525	28	29	25	29	25	The fear of man is a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is set securely on high.
18526	28	29	26	29	26	Many seek the ruler’s favor, but a man receives justice from the LORD.
18527	28	29	27	29	27	An unjust man is detestable to the righteous, and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.
18528	28	30	1	30	1	The words of Agur son of Jakeh—the burden that this man declared to Ithiel: “I am weary, O God, and worn out.
18529	28	30	2	30	2	Surely I am the most ignorant of men, and I lack the understanding of a man.
18530	28	30	3	30	3	I have not learned wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.
18531	28	30	4	30	4	Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in His hands? Who has bound up the waters in His cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is the name of His Son—surely you know!
18532	28	30	5	30	5	Every word of God is flawless; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
18533	28	30	6	30	6	Do not add to His words, lest He rebuke you and prove you a liar.
18534	28	30	7	30	7	Two things I ask of You—do not refuse me before I die:
18535	28	30	8	30	8	Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread that is my portion.
18536	28	30	9	30	9	Otherwise, I may have too much and deny You, saying, ‘Who is the LORD?’ Or I may become poor and steal, profaning the name of my God.
18537	28	30	10	30	10	Do not slander a servant to his master, or he will curse you, and you will bear the guilt.
18538	28	30	11	30	11	There is a generation of those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
18539	28	30	12	30	12	There is a generation of those who are pure in their own eyes and yet unwashed of their filth.
18540	28	30	13	30	13	There is a generation—how haughty are their eyes and pretentious are their glances—
18541	28	30	14	30	14	there is a generation whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are knives, devouring the oppressed from the earth and the needy from among men.
18542	28	30	15	30	15	The leech has two daughters: Give and Give. There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
18543	28	30	16	30	16	Sheol, the barren womb, land never satisfied with water, and fire that never says, ‘Enough!’
18544	28	30	17	30	17	As for the eye that mocks a father and scorns obedience to a mother, may the ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures devour it.
18545	28	30	18	30	18	There are three things too wonderful for me, four that I cannot understand:
18546	28	30	19	30	19	the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a maiden.
18547	28	30	20	30	20	This is the way of an adulteress: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’
18548	28	30	21	30	21	Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:
18549	28	30	22	30	22	a servant who becomes king, a fool who is filled with food,
18550	28	30	23	30	23	an unloved woman who marries, and a maidservant who supplants her mistress.
18551	28	30	24	30	24	Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
18552	28	30	25	30	25	the ants are not a strong species, yet they store up their food in the summer;
18553	28	30	26	30	26	the rock badgers are not a mighty species, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
18554	28	30	27	30	27	the locusts have no king, yet they all advance in formation;
18555	28	30	28	30	28	and the lizard can be caught in one’s hands, yet it is found in the palaces of kings.
18556	28	30	29	30	29	There are three things that are stately in their stride, and four that are impressive in their walk:
18557	28	30	30	30	30	a lion, mighty among beasts, refusing to retreat before anything;
18558	28	30	31	30	31	a strutting rooster; a he-goat; and a king with his army around him.
18559	28	30	32	30	32	If you have foolishly exalted yourself or if you have plotted evil, put your hand over your mouth.
18560	28	30	33	30	33	For as the churning of milk yields butter, and the twisting of the nose draws blood, so the stirring of anger brings forth strife.”
18561	28	31	1	31	1	The sayings for King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him:
18562	28	31	2	31	2	What shall I say, O my son? What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows?
18563	28	31	3	31	3	Do not spend your strength on women or your vigor on those who ruin kings.
18564	28	31	4	31	4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink,
18565	28	31	5	31	5	lest they drink and forget what is decreed, depriving all the oppressed of justice.
18566	28	31	6	31	6	Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to the bitter in soul.
18567	28	31	7	31	7	Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
18568	28	31	8	31	8	Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the cause of all the dispossessed.
18569	28	31	9	31	9	Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the poor and needy.
18570	28	31	10	31	10	A wife of noble character, who can find? She is far more precious than rubies.
18571	28	31	11	31	11	The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he lacks nothing of value.
18572	28	31	12	31	12	She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life.
18573	28	31	13	31	13	She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.
18574	28	31	14	31	14	She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.
18575	28	31	15	31	15	She rises while it is still night to provide food for her household and portions for her maidservants.
18576	28	31	16	31	16	She appraises a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard.
18577	28	31	17	31	17	She girds herself with strength and shows that her arms are strong.
18578	28	31	18	31	18	She sees that her gain is good, and her lamp is not extinguished at night.
18579	28	31	19	31	19	She stretches out her hands to the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
18580	28	31	20	31	20	She opens her arms to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.
18581	28	31	21	31	21	When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for they are all clothed in scarlet.
18582	28	31	22	31	22	She makes coverings for her bed; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
18583	28	31	23	31	23	Her husband is known at the city gate, where he sits among the elders of the land.
18584	28	31	24	31	24	She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchants.
18585	28	31	25	31	25	Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the days to come.
18586	28	31	26	31	26	She opens her mouth with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
18587	28	31	27	31	27	She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
18588	28	31	28	31	28	Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband praises her as well:
18589	28	31	29	31	29	“Many daughters have done noble things, but you surpass them all!”
18590	28	31	30	31	30	Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
18591	28	31	31	31	31	Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the gates.
18592	29	1	1	1	1	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.
18593	29	1	2	1	2	He had seven sons and three daughters,
18594	29	1	3	1	3	and he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East.
18595	29	1	4	1	4	Job’s sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18596	29	1	5	1	5	And when the days of feasting were over, Job would send for his children to purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.
18597	29	1	6	1	6	One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
18598	29	1	7	1	7	“Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. “From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
18599	29	1	8	1	8	Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.”
18600	29	1	9	1	9	Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
18601	29	1	10	1	10	Have You not placed a hedge on every side around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
18602	29	1	11	1	11	But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
18603	29	1	12	1	12	“Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “Everything he has is in your hands, but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
18604	29	1	13	1	13	One day, while Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
18605	29	1	14	1	14	a messenger came and reported to Job: “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
18606	29	1	15	1	15	the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
18607	29	1	16	1	16	While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The fire of God fell from heaven. It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
18608	29	1	17	1	17	While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
18609	29	1	18	1	18	While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
18610	29	1	19	1	19	when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
18611	29	1	20	1	20	Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,
18612	29	1	21	1	21	saying: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD.”
18613	29	1	22	1	22	In all this, Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.
18614	29	2	1	2	1	On another day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before Him.
18615	29	2	2	2	2	“Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. “From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
18616	29	2	3	2	3	Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”
18617	29	2	4	2	4	“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give up all he owns in exchange for his life.
18618	29	2	5	2	5	But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
18619	29	2	6	2	6	“Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “He is in your hands, but you must spare his life.”
18620	29	2	7	2	7	So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and infected Job with terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
18621	29	2	8	2	8	And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes.
18622	29	2	9	2	9	Then Job’s wife said to him, “Do you still retain your integrity? Curse God and die!”
18623	29	2	10	2	10	“You speak as a foolish woman speaks,” he told her. “Should we accept from God only good and not adversity?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
18624	29	2	11	2	11	Now when Job’s three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, each of them came from his home, and they met together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.
18625	29	2	12	2	12	When they lifted up their eyes from afar, they could barely recognize Job. They began to weep aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust into the air over his head.
18626	29	2	13	2	13	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw how intense his suffering was.
18627	29	3	1	3	1	After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18628	29	3	2	3	2	And this is what he said:
18629	29	3	3	3	3	“May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’
18630	29	3	4	3	4	If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it.
18631	29	3	5	3	5	May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.
18632	29	3	6	3	6	If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year, or be entered in any of the months.
18633	29	3	7	3	7	Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it.
18634	29	3	8	3	8	May it be cursed by those who curse the day—those prepared to rouse Leviathan.
18635	29	3	9	3	9	May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn.
18636	29	3	10	3	10	For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes.
18637	29	3	11	3	11	Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb?
18638	29	3	12	3	12	Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed?
18639	29	3	13	3	13	For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
18640	29	3	14	3	14	with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins,
18641	29	3	15	3	15	or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18642	29	3	16	3	16	Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight?
18643	29	3	17	3	17	There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest.
18644	29	3	18	3	18	The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
18645	29	3	19	3	19	Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.
18646	29	3	20	3	20	Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul,
18647	29	3	21	3	21	who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure,
18648	29	3	22	3	22	who rejoice and greatly exult when they can find the grave?
18649	29	3	23	3	23	Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18650	29	3	24	3	24	I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.
18651	29	3	25	3	25	For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me.
18652	29	3	26	3	26	I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”
18653	29	4	1	4	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18654	29	4	2	4	2	“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?
18655	29	4	3	4	3	Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.
18656	29	4	4	4	4	Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.
18657	29	4	5	4	5	But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.
18658	29	4	6	4	6	Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?
18659	29	4	7	4	7	Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?
18660	29	4	8	4	8	As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.
18661	29	4	9	4	9	By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
18662	29	4	10	4	10	The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.
18663	29	4	11	4	11	The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18664	29	4	12	4	12	Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.
18665	29	4	13	4	13	In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
18666	29	4	14	4	14	fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.
18667	29	4	15	4	15	Then a spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.
18668	29	4	16	4	16	It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:
18669	29	4	17	4	17	‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?
18670	29	4	18	4	18	If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,
18671	29	4	19	4	19	how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!
18672	29	4	20	4	20	They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.
18673	29	4	21	4	21	Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’”
18674	29	5	1	5	1	“Call out if you please, but who will answer? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
18675	29	5	2	5	2	For resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
18676	29	5	3	5	3	I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
18677	29	5	4	5	4	His sons are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
18678	29	5	5	5	5	The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
18679	29	5	6	5	6	For distress does not spring from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
18680	29	5	7	5	7	Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
18681	29	5	8	5	8	However, if I were you, I would appeal to God and lay my cause before Him—
18682	29	5	9	5	9	the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders without number.
18683	29	5	10	5	10	He gives rain to the earth and sends water upon the fields.
18684	29	5	11	5	11	He sets the lowly on high, so that mourners are lifted to safety.
18685	29	5	12	5	12	He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, so that their hands find no success.
18686	29	5	13	5	13	He catches the wise in their craftiness, and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.
18687	29	5	14	5	14	They encounter darkness by day and grope at noon as in the night.
18688	29	5	15	5	15	He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth and from the clutches of the powerful.
18689	29	5	16	5	16	So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
18690	29	5	17	5	17	Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18691	29	5	18	5	18	For He wounds, but He also binds; He strikes, but His hands also heal.
18692	29	5	19	5	19	He will rescue you from six calamities; no harm will touch you in seven.
18693	29	5	20	5	20	In famine He will redeem you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
18694	29	5	21	5	21	You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and will not fear havoc when it comes.
18695	29	5	22	5	22	You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
18696	29	5	23	5	23	For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18697	29	5	24	5	24	You will know that your tent is secure, and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.
18698	29	5	25	5	25	You will know that your offspring will be many, your descendants like the grass of the earth.
18699	29	5	26	5	26	You will come to the grave in full vigor, like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.
18700	29	5	27	5	27	Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true! So hear it and know for yourself.”
18701	29	6	1	6	1	Then Job replied:
18702	29	6	2	6	2	“If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales.
18703	29	6	3	6	3	For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas—no wonder my words have been rash.
18704	29	6	4	6	4	For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
18705	29	6	5	6	5	Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass, or an ox low over its fodder?
18706	29	6	6	6	6	Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
18707	29	6	7	6	7	My soul refuses to touch them; they are loathsome food to me.
18708	29	6	8	6	8	If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope:
18709	29	6	9	6	9	that God would be willing to crush me, to unleash His hand and cut me off!
18710	29	6	10	6	10	It still brings me comfort, and joy through unrelenting pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18711	29	6	11	6	11	What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?
18712	29	6	12	6	12	Is my strength like that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?
18713	29	6	13	6	13	Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me?
18714	29	6	14	6	14	A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
18715	29	6	15	6	15	But my brothers are as faithless as wadis, as seasonal streams that overflow,
18716	29	6	16	6	16	darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow,
18717	29	6	17	6	17	but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat.
18718	29	6	18	6	18	Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish.
18719	29	6	19	6	19	The caravans of Tema look for water; the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.
18720	29	6	20	6	20	They are confounded because they had hoped; their arrival brings disappointment.
18721	29	6	21	6	21	For now you are of no help; you see terror, and you are afraid.
18722	29	6	22	6	22	Have I ever said, ‘Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth;
18723	29	6	23	6	23	deliver me from the hand of the enemy; redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’?
18724	29	6	24	6	24	Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand how I have erred.
18725	29	6	25	6	25	How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?
18726	29	6	26	6	26	Do you intend to correct my words, and treat as wind my cry of despair?
18727	29	6	27	6	27	You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend.
18728	29	6	28	6	28	But now, please look at me. Would I lie to your face?
18729	29	6	29	6	29	Reconsider; do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.
18730	29	6	30	6	30	Is there iniquity on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern malice?”
18731	29	7	1	7	1	“Is not man consigned to labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
18732	29	7	2	7	2	Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired hand he waits for his wages.
18733	29	7	3	7	3	So I am allotted months of futility, and nights of misery are appointed me.
18734	29	7	4	7	4	When I lie down I think: ‘When will I get up?’ But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
18735	29	7	5	7	5	My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt; my skin is cracked and festering.
18736	29	7	6	7	6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.
18737	29	7	7	7	7	Remember that my life is but a breath. My eyes will never again see happiness.
18738	29	7	8	7	8	The eye that beholds me will no longer see me. You will look for me, but I will be no more.
18739	29	7	9	7	9	As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up.
18740	29	7	10	7	10	He never returns to his house; his place remembers him no more.
18741	29	7	11	7	11	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18742	29	7	12	7	12	Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that You must keep me under guard?
18743	29	7	13	7	13	When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
18744	29	7	14	7	14	then You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18745	29	7	15	7	15	so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body.
18746	29	7	16	7	16	I loathe my life! I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
18747	29	7	17	7	17	What is man that You should exalt him, that You should set Your heart upon him,
18748	29	7	18	7	18	that You attend to him every morning, and test him every moment?
18749	29	7	19	7	19	Will You never look away from me, or leave me alone to swallow my spittle?
18750	29	7	20	7	20	If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I am a burden to You?
18751	29	7	21	7	21	Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the dust; You will seek me, but I will be no more.”
18752	29	8	1	8	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
18753	29	8	2	8	2	“How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.
18754	29	8	3	8	3	Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18755	29	8	4	8	4	When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.
18756	29	8	5	8	5	But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,
18757	29	8	6	8	6	if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.
18758	29	8	7	8	7	Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.
18759	29	8	8	8	8	Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.
18760	29	8	9	8	9	For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.
18761	29	8	10	8	10	Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?
18762	29	8	11	8	11	Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?
18763	29	8	12	8	12	While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up quicker than grass.
18764	29	8	13	8	13	Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.
18765	29	8	14	8	14	His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.
18766	29	8	15	8	15	He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.
18767	29	8	16	8	16	He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.
18768	29	8	17	8	17	His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.
18769	29	8	18	8	18	If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’
18770	29	8	19	8	19	Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.
18771	29	8	20	8	20	Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.
18772	29	8	21	8	21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.
18773	29	8	22	8	22	Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”
18774	29	9	1	9	1	Then Job answered:
18775	29	9	2	9	2	“Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?
18776	29	9	3	9	3	If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
18777	29	9	4	9	4	God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?
18778	29	9	5	9	5	He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.
18779	29	9	6	9	6	He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.
18780	29	9	7	9	7	He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars.
18781	29	9	8	9	8	He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
18782	29	9	9	9	9	He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
18783	29	9	10	9	10	He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.
18784	29	9	11	9	11	Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.
18785	29	9	12	9	12	If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’
18786	29	9	13	9	13	God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.
18787	29	9	14	9	14	How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?
18788	29	9	15	9	15	For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
18789	29	9	16	9	16	If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.
18790	29	9	17	9	17	For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.
18791	29	9	18	9	18	He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.
18792	29	9	19	9	19	If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?
18793	29	9	20	9	20	Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.
18794	29	9	21	9	21	Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
18795	29	9	22	9	22	It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
18796	29	9	23	9	23	When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.
18797	29	9	24	9	24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
18798	29	9	25	9	25	My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.
18799	29	9	26	9	26	They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
18800	29	9	27	9	27	If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’
18801	29	9	28	9	28	I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.
18802	29	9	29	9	29	Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?
18803	29	9	30	9	30	If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,
18804	29	9	31	9	31	then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me!
18805	29	9	32	9	32	For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.
18806	29	9	33	9	33	Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.
18807	29	9	34	9	34	Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.
18808	29	9	35	9	35	Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.”
18809	29	10	1	10	1	“I loathe my own life; I will express my complaint and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18810	29	10	2	10	2	I will say to God: Do not condemn me! Let me know why You prosecute me.
18811	29	10	3	10	3	Does it please You to oppress me, to reject the work of Your hands and favor the schemes of the wicked?
18812	29	10	4	10	4	Do You have eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees?
18813	29	10	5	10	5	Are Your days like those of a mortal, or Your years like those of a man,
18814	29	10	6	10	6	that You should seek my iniquity and search out my sin—
18815	29	10	7	10	7	though You know that I am not guilty, and there is no deliverance from Your hand?
18816	29	10	8	10	8	Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. Would You now turn and destroy me?
18817	29	10	9	10	9	Please remember that You molded me like clay. Would You now return me to dust?
18818	29	10	10	10	10	Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?
18819	29	10	11	10	11	You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
18820	29	10	12	10	12	You have granted me life and loving devotion, and Your care has preserved my spirit.
18821	29	10	13	10	13	Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, and I know that this was in Your mind:
18822	29	10	14	10	14	If I sinned, You would take note, and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
18823	29	10	15	10	15	If I am guilty, woe to me! And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. I am full of shame and aware of my affliction.
18824	29	10	16	10	16	Should I hold my head high, You would hunt me like a lion, and again display Your power against me.
18825	29	10	17	10	17	You produce new witnesses against me and multiply Your anger toward me. Hardships assault me in wave after wave.
18826	29	10	18	10	18	Why then did You bring me from the womb? Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!
18827	29	10	19	10	19	If only I had never come to be, but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
18828	29	10	20	10	20	Are my days not few? Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort,
18829	29	10	21	10	21	before I go—never to return—to a land of darkness and gloom,
18830	29	10	22	10	22	to a land of utter darkness, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness.”
18831	29	11	1	11	1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
18832	29	11	2	11	2	“Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated?
18833	29	11	3	11	3	Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke?
18834	29	11	4	11	4	You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’
18835	29	11	5	11	5	But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,
18836	29	11	6	11	6	and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.
18837	29	11	7	11	7	Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?
18838	29	11	8	11	8	They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?
18839	29	11	9	11	9	Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18840	29	11	10	11	10	If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him?
18841	29	11	11	11	11	Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?
18842	29	11	12	11	12	But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!
18843	29	11	13	11	13	As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him,
18844	29	11	14	11	14	if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,
18845	29	11	15	11	15	then indeed you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and unafraid.
18846	29	11	16	11	16	For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.
18847	29	11	17	11	17	Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.
18848	29	11	18	11	18	You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety.
18849	29	11	19	11	19	You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor.
18850	29	11	20	11	20	But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”
18851	29	12	1	12	1	Then Job answered:
18852	29	12	2	12	2	“Truly then you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!
18853	29	12	3	12	3	But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?
18854	29	12	4	12	4	I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
18855	29	12	5	12	5	The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
18856	29	12	6	12	6	The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure—those who carry their god in their hands.
18857	29	12	7	12	7	But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.
18858	29	12	8	12	8	Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.
18859	29	12	9	12	9	Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18860	29	12	10	12	10	The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.
18861	29	12	11	12	11	Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?
18862	29	12	12	12	12	Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.
18863	29	12	13	12	13	Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.
18864	29	12	14	12	14	What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.
18865	29	12	15	12	15	If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.
18866	29	12	16	12	16	True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.
18867	29	12	17	12	17	He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.
18868	29	12	18	12	18	He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.
18869	29	12	19	12	19	He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.
18870	29	12	20	12	20	He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.
18871	29	12	21	12	21	He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
18872	29	12	22	12	22	He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.
18873	29	12	23	12	23	He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.
18874	29	12	24	12	24	He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
18875	29	12	25	12	25	They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.”
18876	29	13	1	13	1	“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.
18877	29	13	2	13	2	What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18878	29	13	3	13	3	Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.
18879	29	13	4	13	4	You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.
18880	29	13	5	13	5	If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!
18881	29	13	6	13	6	Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.
18882	29	13	7	13	7	Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?
18883	29	13	8	13	8	Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?
18884	29	13	9	13	9	Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him like a man?
18885	29	13	10	13	10	Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
18886	29	13	11	13	11	Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
18887	29	13	12	13	12	Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
18888	29	13	13	13	13	Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.
18889	29	13	14	13	14	Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?
18890	29	13	15	13	15	Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways to His face.
18891	29	13	16	13	16	Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.
18892	29	13	17	13	17	Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.
18893	29	13	18	13	18	Behold, now that I have prepared my case, I know that I will be vindicated.
18894	29	13	19	13	19	Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.
18895	29	13	20	13	20	Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:
18896	29	13	21	13	21	Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.
18897	29	13	22	13	22	Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.
18898	29	13	23	13	23	How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
18899	29	13	24	13	24	Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?
18900	29	13	25	13	25	Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?
18901	29	13	26	13	26	For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.
18902	29	13	27	13	27	You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
18903	29	13	28	13	28	So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.”
18904	29	14	1	14	1	“Man, who is born of woman, is short of days and full of trouble.
18905	29	14	2	14	2	Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.
18906	29	14	3	14	3	Do You open your eyes to one like this? Will You bring him into judgment before You?
18907	29	14	4	14	4	Who can bring out clean from unclean? No one!
18908	29	14	5	14	5	Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with You, and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed,
18909	29	14	6	14	6	look away from him and let him rest, so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.
18910	29	14	7	14	7	For there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not fail.
18911	29	14	8	14	8	If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil,
18912	29	14	9	14	9	at the scent of water it will bud and put forth twigs like a sapling.
18913	29	14	10	14	10	But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last, and where is he?
18914	29	14	11	14	11	As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry,
18915	29	14	12	14	12	so a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, he will not be awakened or roused from sleep.
18916	29	14	13	14	13	If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger passes. If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me.
18917	29	14	14	14	14	When a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, until my relief comes.
18918	29	14	15	14	15	You will call, and I will answer; You will desire the work of Your hands.
18919	29	14	16	14	16	For then You would count my steps, but would not keep track of my sin.
18920	29	14	17	14	17	My transgression would be sealed in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity.
18921	29	14	18	14	18	But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,
18922	29	14	19	14	19	as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so You destroy a man’s hope.
18923	29	14	20	14	20	You forever overpower him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.
18924	29	14	21	14	21	If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he is unaware.
18925	29	14	22	14	22	He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.”
18926	29	15	1	15	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
18927	29	15	2	15	2	“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
18928	29	15	3	15	3	Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?
18929	29	15	4	15	4	But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.
18930	29	15	5	15	5	For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.
18931	29	15	6	15	6	Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.
18932	29	15	7	15	7	Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
18933	29	15	8	15	8	Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?
18934	29	15	9	15	9	What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?
18935	29	15	10	15	10	Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side—men much older than your father.
18936	29	15	11	15	11	Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?
18937	29	15	12	15	12	Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18938	29	15	13	15	13	as you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?
18939	29	15	14	15	14	What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?
18940	29	15	15	15	15	If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,
18941	29	15	16	15	16	how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?
18942	29	15	17	15	17	Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,
18943	29	15	18	15	18	what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,
18944	29	15	19	15	19	to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.
18945	29	15	20	15	20	A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.
18946	29	15	21	15	21	Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.
18947	29	15	22	15	22	He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.
18948	29	15	23	15	23	He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
18949	29	15	24	15	24	Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.
18950	29	15	25	15	25	For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,
18951	29	15	26	15	26	rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.
18952	29	15	27	15	27	Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,
18953	29	15	28	15	28	he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.
18954	29	15	29	15	29	He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.
18955	29	15	30	15	30	He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
18956	29	15	31	15	31	Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.
18957	29	15	32	15	32	It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.
18958	29	15	33	15	33	He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
18959	29	15	34	15	34	For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
18960	29	15	35	15	35	They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”
18961	29	16	1	16	1	Then Job answered:
18962	29	16	2	16	2	“I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.
18963	29	16	3	16	3	Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?
18964	29	16	4	16	4	I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.
18965	29	16	5	16	5	But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.
18966	29	16	6	16	6	Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?
18967	29	16	7	16	7	Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.
18968	29	16	8	16	8	You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.
18969	29	16	9	16	9	His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.
18970	29	16	10	16	10	They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.
18971	29	16	11	16	11	God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.
18972	29	16	12	16	12	I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;
18973	29	16	13	16	13	His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.
18974	29	16	14	16	14	He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.
18975	29	16	15	16	15	I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.
18976	29	16	16	16	16	My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;
18977	29	16	17	16	17	yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.
18978	29	16	18	16	18	O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.
18979	29	16	19	16	19	Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.
18980	29	16	20	16	20	My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.
18981	29	16	21	16	21	Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!
18982	29	16	22	16	22	For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.”
18983	29	17	1	17	1	“My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.
18984	29	17	2	17	2	Surely mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.
18985	29	17	3	17	3	Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?
18986	29	17	4	17	4	You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.
18987	29	17	5	17	5	If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.
18988	29	17	6	17	6	He has made me a byword among the people, a man in whose face they spit.
18989	29	17	7	17	7	My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.
18990	29	17	8	17	8	The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.
18991	29	17	9	17	9	Yet a righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.
18992	29	17	10	17	10	But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.
18993	29	17	11	17	11	My days have passed; my plans are broken off—even the desires of my heart.
18994	29	17	12	17	12	They have turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness.
18995	29	17	13	17	13	If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,
18996	29	17	14	17	14	and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
18997	29	17	15	17	15	where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
18998	29	17	16	17	16	Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?”
18999	29	18	1	18	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
19000	29	18	2	18	2	“How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.
19001	29	18	3	18	3	Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?
19002	29	18	4	18	4	You who tear yourself in anger—should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?
19003	29	18	5	18	5	Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.
19004	29	18	6	18	6	The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.
19005	29	18	7	18	7	His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.
19006	29	18	8	18	8	For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.
19007	29	18	9	18	9	A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.
19008	29	18	10	18	10	A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.
19009	29	18	11	18	11	Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.
19010	29	18	12	18	12	His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.
19011	29	18	13	18	13	It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.
19012	29	18	14	18	14	He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.
19013	29	18	15	18	15	Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.
19014	29	18	16	18	16	The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.
19015	29	18	17	18	17	The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.
19016	29	18	18	18	18	He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.
19017	29	18	19	18	19	He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.
19018	29	18	20	18	20	Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.
19019	29	18	21	18	21	Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”
19020	29	19	1	19	1	Then Job answered:
19021	29	19	2	19	2	“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?
19022	29	19	3	19	3	Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.
19023	29	19	4	19	4	Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.
19024	29	19	5	19	5	If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,
19025	29	19	6	19	6	then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.
19026	29	19	7	19	7	Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.
19027	29	19	8	19	8	He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.
19028	29	19	9	19	9	He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
19029	29	19	10	19	10	He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.
19030	29	19	11	19	11	His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.
19031	29	19	12	19	12	His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
19032	29	19	13	19	13	He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.
19033	29	19	14	19	14	My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.
19034	29	19	15	19	15	My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.
19035	29	19	16	19	16	I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.
19036	29	19	17	19	17	My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.
19037	29	19	18	19	18	Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.
19038	29	19	19	19	19	All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.
19039	29	19	20	19	20	My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
19040	29	19	21	19	21	Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
19041	29	19	22	19	22	Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
19042	29	19	23	19	23	I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,
19043	29	19	24	19	24	by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.
19044	29	19	25	19	25	But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.
19045	29	19	26	19	26	Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.
19046	29	19	27	19	27	I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!
19047	29	19	28	19	28	If you say, ‘How we will persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’
19048	29	19	29	19	29	then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”
19049	29	20	1	20	1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
19050	29	20	2	20	2	“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me.
19051	29	20	3	20	3	I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply.
19052	29	20	4	20	4	Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth,
19053	29	20	5	20	5	the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary?
19054	29	20	6	20	6	Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,
19055	29	20	7	20	7	he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’
19056	29	20	8	20	8	He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
19057	29	20	9	20	9	The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him.
19058	29	20	10	20	10	His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth.
19059	29	20	11	20	11	The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust.
19060	29	20	12	20	12	Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,
19061	29	20	13	20	13	though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,
19062	29	20	14	20	14	yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him.
19063	29	20	15	20	15	He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach.
19064	29	20	16	20	16	He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him.
19065	29	20	17	20	17	He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
19066	29	20	18	20	18	He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.
19067	29	20	19	20	19	For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build.
19068	29	20	20	20	20	Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure.
19069	29	20	21	20	21	Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure.
19070	29	20	22	20	22	In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him.
19071	29	20	23	20	23	When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats.
19072	29	20	24	20	24	Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.
19073	29	20	25	20	25	It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver. Terrors come over him.
19074	29	20	26	20	26	Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
19075	29	20	27	20	27	The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.
19076	29	20	28	20	28	The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.
19077	29	20	29	20	29	This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”
19078	29	21	1	21	1	Then Job answered:
19079	29	21	2	21	2	“Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me.
19080	29	21	3	21	3	Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.
19081	29	21	4	21	4	Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient?
19082	29	21	5	21	5	Look at me and be astonished; put your hand over your mouth.
19083	29	21	6	21	6	When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.
19084	29	21	7	21	7	Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
19085	29	21	8	21	8	Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes.
19086	29	21	9	21	9	Their homes are safe from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.
19087	29	21	10	21	10	Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.
19088	29	21	11	21	11	They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about,
19089	29	21	12	21	12	singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute.
19090	29	21	13	21	13	They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.
19091	29	21	14	21	14	Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways.
19092	29	21	15	21	15	Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’
19093	29	21	16	21	16	Yet their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
19094	29	21	17	21	17	How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?
19095	29	21	18	21	18	Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm?
19096	29	21	19	21	19	It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so that he may know it.
19097	29	21	20	21	20	Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.
19098	29	21	21	21	21	For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out?
19099	29	21	22	21	22	Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high?
19100	29	21	23	21	23	One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease.
19101	29	21	24	21	24	His body is well nourished, and his bones are rich with marrow.
19102	29	21	25	21	25	Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity.
19103	29	21	26	21	26	But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both.
19104	29	21	27	21	27	Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.
19105	29	21	28	21	28	For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’
19106	29	21	29	21	29	Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports?
19107	29	21	30	21	30	Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath.
19108	29	21	31	21	31	Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?
19109	29	21	32	21	32	He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.
19110	29	21	33	21	33	The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number.
19111	29	21	34	21	34	So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”
19112	29	22	1	22	1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
19113	29	22	2	22	2	“Can a man be of use to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him?
19114	29	22	3	22	3	Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? Does He profit if your ways are blameless?
19115	29	22	4	22	4	Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you?
19116	29	22	5	22	5	Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless?
19117	29	22	6	22	6	For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.
19118	29	22	7	22	7	You gave no water to the weary, and you withheld food from the famished,
19119	29	22	8	22	8	while the land belonged to a mighty man, and a man of honor lived on it.
19120	29	22	9	22	9	You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
19121	29	22	10	22	10	Therefore snares surround you, and sudden peril terrifies you;
19122	29	22	11	22	11	it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.
19123	29	22	12	22	12	Is not God as high as the heavens? Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!
19124	29	22	13	22	13	Yet you say: ‘What does God know? Does He judge through thick darkness?
19125	29	22	14	22	14	Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us as He traverses the vault of heaven.’
19126	29	22	15	22	15	Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod?
19127	29	22	16	22	16	They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were swept away by a flood.
19128	29	22	17	22	17	They said to God, ‘Depart from us. What can the Almighty do to us?’
19129	29	22	18	22	18	But it was He who filled their houses with good things; so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
19130	29	22	19	22	19	The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent mock them:
19131	29	22	20	22	20	‘Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire has consumed their excess.’
19132	29	22	21	22	21	Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; thereby good will come to you.
19133	29	22	22	22	22	Receive instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.
19134	29	22	23	22	23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove injustice from your tents
19135	29	22	24	22	24	and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,
19136	29	22	25	22	25	then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you.
19137	29	22	26	22	26	Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.
19138	29	22	27	22	27	You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
19139	29	22	28	22	28	Your decisions will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.
19140	29	22	29	22	29	When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ then He will save the lowly.
19141	29	22	30	22	30	He will deliver even one who is not innocent, rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.”
19142	29	23	1	23	1	Then Job answered:
19143	29	23	2	23	2	“Even today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
19144	29	23	3	23	3	If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat.
19145	29	23	4	23	4	I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.
19146	29	23	5	23	5	I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say.
19147	29	23	6	23	6	Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me.
19148	29	23	7	23	7	Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
19149	29	23	8	23	8	If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him.
19150	29	23	9	23	9	When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.
19151	29	23	10	23	10	Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
19152	29	23	11	23	11	My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside.
19153	29	23	12	23	12	I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.
19154	29	23	13	23	13	But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.
19155	29	23	14	23	14	For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans.
19156	29	23	15	23	15	Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him.
19157	29	23	16	23	16	God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
19158	29	23	17	23	17	Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.”
19159	29	24	1	24	1	“Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why may those who know Him never see His days?
19160	29	24	2	24	2	Men move boundary stones; they pasture stolen flocks.
19161	29	24	3	24	3	They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
19162	29	24	4	24	4	They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
19163	29	24	5	24	5	Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go to work foraging for food; the wasteland is food for their children.
19164	29	24	6	24	6	They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
19165	29	24	7	24	7	Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold.
19166	29	24	8	24	8	Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.
19167	29	24	9	24	9	The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.
19168	29	24	10	24	10	Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
19169	29	24	11	24	11	They crush olives within their walls; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
19170	29	24	12	24	12	From the city, men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out, yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.
19171	29	24	13	24	13	Then there are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.
19172	29	24	14	24	14	When daylight is gone, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; in the night he is like a thief.
19173	29	24	15	24	15	The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face.
19174	29	24	16	24	16	In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in, never to experience the light.
19175	29	24	17	24	17	For to them, deep darkness is their morning; surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!
19176	29	24	18	24	18	They are but foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one turns toward their vineyards.
19177	29	24	19	24	19	As drought and heat consume the melting snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned.
19178	29	24	20	24	20	The womb forgets them; the worm feeds on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is like a broken tree.
19179	29	24	21	24	21	They prey on the barren and childless, and show no kindness to the widow.
19180	29	24	22	24	22	Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty; though rising up, they have no assurance of life.
19181	29	24	23	24	23	He gives them a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways.
19182	29	24	24	24	24	They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
19183	29	24	25	24	25	If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing?”
19184	29	25	1	25	1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
19185	29	25	2	25	2	“Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.
19186	29	25	3	25	3	Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise?
19187	29	25	4	25	4	How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
19188	29	25	5	25	5	If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight,
19189	29	25	6	25	6	how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!”
19190	29	26	1	26	1	Then Job answered:
19191	29	26	2	26	2	“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!
19192	29	26	3	26	3	How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!
19193	29	26	4	26	4	To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?
19194	29	26	5	26	5	The dead tremble—those who dwell beneath the waters.
19195	29	26	6	26	6	Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
19196	29	26	7	26	7	He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.
19197	29	26	8	26	8	He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.
19198	29	26	9	26	9	He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.
19199	29	26	10	26	10	He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
19200	29	26	11	26	11	The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.
19201	29	26	12	26	12	By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
19202	29	26	13	26	13	By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
19203	29	26	14	26	14	Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
19204	29	27	1	27	1	Job continued his discourse:
19205	29	27	2	27	2	“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—
19206	29	27	3	27	3	as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,
19207	29	27	4	27	4	my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.
19208	29	27	5	27	5	I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.
19209	29	27	6	27	6	I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.
19210	29	27	7	27	7	May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.
19211	29	27	8	27	8	For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
19212	29	27	9	27	9	Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
19213	29	27	10	27	10	Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
19214	29	27	11	27	11	I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.
19215	29	27	12	27	12	Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?
19216	29	27	13	27	13	This is the wicked man’s portion from God—the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.
19217	29	27	14	27	14	Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.
19218	29	27	15	27	15	His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.
19219	29	27	16	27	16	Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,
19220	29	27	17	27	17	what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.
19221	29	27	18	27	18	The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.
19222	29	27	19	27	19	He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
19223	29	27	20	27	20	Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.
19224	29	27	21	27	21	The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
19225	29	27	22	27	22	It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
19226	29	27	23	27	23	It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.”
19227	29	28	1	28	1	“Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
19228	29	28	2	28	2	Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
19229	29	28	3	28	3	Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.
19230	29	28	4	28	4	Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways.
19231	29	28	5	28	5	Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire.
19232	29	28	6	28	6	Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold.
19233	29	28	7	28	7	No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.
19234	29	28	8	28	8	Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it.
19235	29	28	9	28	9	The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base.
19236	29	28	10	28	10	He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.
19237	29	28	11	28	11	He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light.
19238	29	28	12	28	12	But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell?
19239	29	28	13	28	13	No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.
19240	29	28	14	28	14	The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’
19241	29	28	15	28	15	It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
19242	29	28	16	28	16	It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.
19243	29	28	17	28	17	Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.
19244	29	28	18	28	18	Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
19245	29	28	19	28	19	Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
19246	29	28	20	28	20	From where then does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell?
19247	29	28	21	28	21	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air.
19248	29	28	22	28	22	Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’
19249	29	28	23	28	23	But God understands its way, and He knows its place.
19250	29	28	24	28	24	For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
19251	29	28	25	28	25	When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters,
19252	29	28	26	28	26	when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt,
19253	29	28	27	28	27	then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out.
19254	29	28	28	28	28	And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
19255	29	29	1	29	1	And Job continued his discourse:
19256	29	29	2	29	2	“How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,
19257	29	29	3	29	3	when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness,
19258	29	29	4	29	4	when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God rested on my tent,
19259	29	29	5	29	5	when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
19260	29	29	6	29	6	when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
19261	29	29	7	29	7	When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,
19262	29	29	8	29	8	the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet.
19263	29	29	9	29	9	The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.
19264	29	29	10	29	10	The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
19265	29	29	11	29	11	For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me,
19266	29	29	12	29	12	because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper.
19267	29	29	13	29	13	The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
19268	29	29	14	29	14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban.
19269	29	29	15	29	15	I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame.
19270	29	29	16	29	16	I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger.
19271	29	29	17	29	17	I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.
19272	29	29	18	29	18	So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand.
19273	29	29	19	29	19	My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.
19274	29	29	20	29	20	My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’
19275	29	29	21	29	21	Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel.
19276	29	29	22	29	22	After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew.
19277	29	29	23	29	23	They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers.
19278	29	29	24	29	24	If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious.
19279	29	29	25	29	25	I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.”
19280	29	30	1	30	1	“But now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to entrust with my sheep dogs.
19281	29	30	2	30	2	What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them?
19282	29	30	3	30	3	Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night.
19283	29	30	4	30	4	They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.
19284	29	30	5	30	5	They were banished from among men, shouted down like thieves,
19285	29	30	6	30	6	so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
19286	29	30	7	30	7	They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles.
19287	29	30	8	30	8	A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land.
19288	29	30	9	30	9	And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
19289	29	30	10	30	10	They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
19290	29	30	11	30	11	Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
19291	29	30	12	30	12	The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me.
19292	29	30	13	30	13	They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them.
19293	29	30	14	30	14	They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in.
19294	29	30	15	30	15	Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.
19295	29	30	16	30	16	And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.
19296	29	30	17	30	17	Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest.
19297	29	30	18	30	18	With great force He grasps my garment; He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.
19298	29	30	19	30	19	He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.
19299	29	30	20	30	20	I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me.
19300	29	30	21	30	21	You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand.
19301	29	30	22	30	22	You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about in the storm.
19302	29	30	23	30	23	Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.
19303	29	30	24	30	24	Yet no one stretches out his hand to a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress.
19304	29	30	25	30	25	Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
19305	29	30	26	30	26	But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell.
19306	29	30	27	30	27	I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me.
19307	29	30	28	30	28	I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
19308	29	30	29	30	29	I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of ostriches.
19309	29	30	30	30	30	My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever.
19310	29	30	31	30	31	My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.”
19311	29	31	1	31	1	“I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?
19312	29	31	2	31	2	For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high?
19313	29	31	3	31	3	Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity?
19314	29	31	4	31	4	Does He not see my ways and count my every step?
19315	29	31	5	31	5	If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,
19316	29	31	6	31	6	let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity.
19317	29	31	7	31	7	If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands,
19318	29	31	8	31	8	then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.
19319	29	31	9	31	9	If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door,
19320	29	31	10	31	10	then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her.
19321	29	31	11	31	11	For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged.
19322	29	31	12	31	12	For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; it would root out my entire harvest.
19323	29	31	13	31	13	If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,
19324	29	31	14	31	14	what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account?
19325	29	31	15	31	15	Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb?
19326	29	31	16	31	16	If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,
19327	29	31	17	31	17	if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless—
19328	29	31	18	31	18	though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
19329	29	31	19	31	19	if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak,
19330	29	31	20	31	20	if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,
19331	29	31	21	31	21	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate,
19332	29	31	22	31	22	then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket.
19333	29	31	23	31	23	For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower.
19334	29	31	24	31	24	If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security,
19335	29	31	25	31	25	if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much,
19336	29	31	26	31	26	if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
19337	29	31	27	31	27	so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
19338	29	31	28	31	28	this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high.
19339	29	31	29	31	29	If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him—
19340	29	31	30	31	30	I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse—
19341	29	31	31	31	31	if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—
19342	29	31	32	31	32	but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler—
19343	29	31	33	31	33	if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart,
19344	29	31	34	31	34	because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside—
19345	29	31	35	31	35	(Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment.
19346	29	31	36	31	36	Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.
19347	29	31	37	31	37	I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)—
19348	29	31	38	31	38	if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together,
19349	29	31	39	31	39	if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,
19350	29	31	40	31	40	then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.
19351	29	32	1	32	1	So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
19352	29	32	2	32	2	This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,
19353	29	32	3	32	3	and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
19354	29	32	4	32	4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.
19355	29	32	5	32	5	But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.
19356	29	32	6	32	6	So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.
19357	29	32	7	32	7	I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.
19358	29	32	8	32	8	But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
19359	29	32	9	32	9	It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.
19360	29	32	10	32	10	Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’
19361	29	32	11	32	11	Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,
19362	29	32	12	32	12	I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.
19363	29	32	13	32	13	So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’
19364	29	32	14	32	14	But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
19365	29	32	15	32	15	Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.
19366	29	32	16	32	16	Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?
19367	29	32	17	32	17	I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.
19368	29	32	18	32	18	For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.
19369	29	32	19	32	19	Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
19370	29	32	20	32	20	I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.
19371	29	32	21	32	21	I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.
19372	29	32	22	32	22	For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.”
19373	29	33	1	33	1	“But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.
19374	29	33	2	33	2	Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.
19375	29	33	3	33	3	My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.
19376	29	33	4	33	4	The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
19377	29	33	5	33	5	Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.
19378	29	33	6	33	6	I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.
19379	29	33	7	33	7	Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.
19380	29	33	8	33	8	Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:
19381	29	33	9	33	9	‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.
19382	29	33	10	33	10	Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.
19383	29	33	11	33	11	He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’
19384	29	33	12	33	12	Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
19385	29	33	13	33	13	Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks?
19386	29	33	14	33	14	For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.
19387	29	33	15	33	15	In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,
19388	29	33	16	33	16	He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings
19389	29	33	17	33	17	to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
19390	29	33	18	33	18	to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.
19391	29	33	19	33	19	A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,
19392	29	33	20	33	20	so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.
19393	29	33	21	33	21	His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.
19394	29	33	22	33	22	He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.
19395	29	33	23	33	23	Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
19396	29	33	24	33	24	to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’
19397	29	33	25	33	25	then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.
19398	29	33	26	33	26	He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.
19399	29	33	27	33	27	Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.
19400	29	33	28	33	28	He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’
19401	29	33	29	33	29	Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,
19402	29	33	30	33	30	to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
19403	29	33	31	33	31	Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
19404	29	33	32	33	32	But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.
19405	29	33	33	33	33	But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
19406	29	34	1	34	1	Then Elihu continued:
19407	29	34	2	34	2	“Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.
19408	29	34	3	34	3	For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.
19409	29	34	4	34	4	Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
19410	29	34	5	34	5	For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.
19411	29	34	6	34	6	Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
19412	29	34	7	34	7	What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?
19413	29	34	8	34	8	He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.
19414	29	34	9	34	9	For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’
19415	29	34	10	34	10	Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.
19416	29	34	11	34	11	For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.
19417	29	34	12	34	12	Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
19418	29	34	13	34	13	Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?
19419	29	34	14	34	14	If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,
19420	29	34	15	34	15	all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
19421	29	34	16	34	16	If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.
19422	29	34	17	34	17	Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
19423	29	34	18	34	18	who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
19424	29	34	19	34	19	who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.
19425	29	34	20	34	20	They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
19426	29	34	21	34	21	For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.
19427	29	34	22	34	22	There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.
19428	29	34	23	34	23	For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.
19429	29	34	24	34	24	He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.
19430	29	34	25	34	25	Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
19431	29	34	26	34	26	He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,
19432	29	34	27	34	27	because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.
19433	29	34	28	34	28	They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
19434	29	34	29	34	29	But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,
19435	29	34	30	34	30	that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.
19436	29	34	31	34	31	Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.
19437	29	34	32	34	32	Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’
19438	29	34	33	34	33	Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.
19439	29	34	34	34	34	Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:
19440	29	34	35	34	35	‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’
19441	29	34	36	34	36	If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.
19442	29	34	37	34	37	For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
19443	29	35	1	35	1	And Elihu went on to say:
19444	29	35	2	35	2	“Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God.’
19445	29	35	3	35	3	For you ask, ‘What does it profit me, and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’
19446	29	35	4	35	4	I will reply to you and to your friends as well.
19447	29	35	5	35	5	Look to the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.
19448	29	35	6	35	6	If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?
19449	29	35	7	35	7	If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?
19450	29	35	8	35	8	Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only a son of man.
19451	29	35	9	35	9	Men cry out under great oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.
19452	29	35	10	35	10	But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives us songs in the night,
19453	29	35	11	35	11	who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’
19454	29	35	12	35	12	There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.
19455	29	35	13	35	13	Surely God does not listen to empty pleas, and the Almighty does not take note of it.
19456	29	35	14	35	14	How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,
19457	29	35	15	35	15	and further, that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly.
19458	29	35	16	35	16	So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.”
19459	29	36	1	36	1	And Elihu continued:
19460	29	36	2	36	2	“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.
19461	29	36	3	36	3	I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
19462	29	36	4	36	4	For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.
19463	29	36	5	36	5	Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.
19464	29	36	6	36	6	He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.
19465	29	36	7	36	7	He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
19466	29	36	8	36	8	And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,
19467	29	36	9	36	9	then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
19468	29	36	10	36	10	He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.
19469	29	36	11	36	11	If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.
19470	29	36	12	36	12	But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
19471	29	36	13	36	13	The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.
19472	29	36	14	36	14	They die in their youth, among the male cult prostitutes.
19473	29	36	15	36	15	God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.
19474	29	36	16	36	16	Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.
19475	29	36	17	36	17	But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.
19476	29	36	18	36	18	Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.
19477	29	36	19	36	19	Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?
19478	29	36	20	36	20	Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.
19479	29	36	21	36	21	Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.
19480	29	36	22	36	22	Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?
19481	29	36	23	36	23	Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?
19482	29	36	24	36	24	Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.
19483	29	36	25	36	25	All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.
19484	29	36	26	36	26	Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.
19485	29	36	27	36	27	For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,
19486	29	36	28	36	28	which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.
19487	29	36	29	36	29	Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?
19488	29	36	30	36	30	See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.
19489	29	36	31	36	31	For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance.
19490	29	36	32	36	32	He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
19491	29	36	33	36	33	The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.”
19492	29	37	1	37	1	“At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place.
19493	29	37	2	37	2	Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.
19494	29	37	3	37	3	He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth.
19495	29	37	4	37	4	Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.
19496	29	37	5	37	5	God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend.
19497	29	37	6	37	6	For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’
19498	29	37	7	37	7	He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.
19499	29	37	8	37	8	The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens.
19500	29	37	9	37	9	The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.
19501	29	37	10	37	10	By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen.
19502	29	37	11	37	11	He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.
19503	29	37	12	37	12	They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth.
19504	29	37	13	37	13	Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.
19505	29	37	14	37	14	Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God.
19506	29	37	15	37	15	Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash?
19507	29	37	16	37	16	Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
19508	29	37	17	37	17	You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
19509	29	37	18	37	18	can you, like Him, spread out the skies to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze?
19510	29	37	19	37	19	Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness.
19511	29	37	20	37	20	Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up?
19512	29	37	21	37	21	Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
19513	29	37	22	37	22	Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him.
19514	29	37	23	37	23	The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness, He does not oppress.
19515	29	37	24	37	24	Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”
19516	29	38	1	38	1	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
19517	29	38	2	38	2	“Who is this who obscures My counsel by words without knowledge?
19518	29	38	3	38	3	Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall inform Me!
19519	29	38	4	38	4	Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding.
19520	29	38	5	38	5	Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched a measuring line across it?
19521	29	38	6	38	6	On what were its foundations set, or who laid its cornerstone,
19522	29	38	7	38	7	while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
19523	29	38	8	38	8	Who enclosed the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
19524	29	38	9	38	9	when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness its blanket,
19525	29	38	10	38	10	when I fixed its boundaries and set in place its bars and doors,
19526	29	38	11	38	11	and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther; here your proud waves must stop’?
19527	29	38	12	38	12	In your days, have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place,
19528	29	38	13	38	13	that it might spread to the ends of the earth and shake the wicked out of it?
19529	29	38	14	38	14	The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.
19530	29	38	15	38	15	Light is withheld from the wicked, and their upraised arm is broken.
19531	29	38	16	38	16	Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea or walked in the trenches of the deep?
19532	29	38	17	38	17	Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
19533	29	38	18	38	18	Have you surveyed the extent of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this.
19534	29	38	19	38	19	Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides,
19535	29	38	20	38	20	so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home?
19536	29	38	21	38	21	Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great!
19537	29	38	22	38	22	Have you entered the storehouses of snow or observed the storehouses of hail,
19538	29	38	23	38	23	which I hold in reserve for times of trouble, for the day of war and battle?
19539	29	38	24	38	24	In which direction is the lightning dispersed, or the east wind scattered over the earth?
19540	29	38	25	38	25	Who cuts a channel for the flood or clears a path for the thunderbolt,
19541	29	38	26	38	26	to bring rain on a barren land, on a desert where no man lives,
19542	29	38	27	38	27	to satisfy the parched wasteland and make it sprout with tender grass?
19543	29	38	28	38	28	Does the rain have a father? Who has begotten the drops of dew?
19544	29	38	29	38	29	From whose womb does the ice emerge? Who gave birth to the frost from heaven,
19545	29	38	30	38	30	when the waters become hard as stone and the surface of the deep is frozen?
19546	29	38	31	38	31	Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?
19547	29	38	32	38	32	Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear and her cubs?
19548	29	38	33	38	33	Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth?
19549	29	38	34	38	34	Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?
19550	29	38	35	38	35	Can you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
19551	29	38	36	38	36	Who has put wisdom in the heart or given understanding to the mind?
19552	29	38	37	38	37	Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Or who can tilt the water jars of the heavens
19553	29	38	38	38	38	when the dust hardens into a mass and the clods of earth stick together?
19554	29	38	39	38	39	Can you hunt the prey for a lioness or satisfy the hunger of young lions
19555	29	38	40	38	40	when they crouch in their dens and lie in wait in the thicket?
19556	29	38	41	38	41	Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God as they wander about for lack of food?”
19557	29	39	1	39	1	“Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?
19558	29	39	2	39	2	Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?
19559	29	39	3	39	3	They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.
19560	29	39	4	39	4	Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.
19561	29	39	5	39	5	Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?
19562	29	39	6	39	6	I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.
19563	29	39	7	39	7	He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.
19564	29	39	8	39	8	He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.
19565	29	39	9	39	9	Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?
19566	29	39	10	39	10	Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?
19567	29	39	11	39	11	Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?
19568	29	39	12	39	12	Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
19569	29	39	13	39	13	The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork.
19570	29	39	14	39	14	For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.
19571	29	39	15	39	15	She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.
19572	29	39	16	39	16	She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.
19573	29	39	17	39	17	For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.
19574	29	39	18	39	18	Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.
19575	29	39	19	39	19	Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?
19576	29	39	20	39	20	Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?
19577	29	39	21	39	21	He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.
19578	29	39	22	39	22	He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.
19579	29	39	23	39	23	A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.
19580	29	39	24	39	24	Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.
19581	29	39	25	39	25	At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor. He catches the scent of battle from afar—the shouts of captains and the cry of war.
19582	29	39	26	39	26	Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?
19583	29	39	27	39	27	Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?
19584	29	39	28	39	28	He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.
19585	29	39	29	39	29	From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.
19586	29	39	30	39	30	His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”
19587	29	40	1	40	1	And the LORD said to Job:
19588	29	40	2	40	2	“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God give an answer.”
19589	29	40	3	40	3	Then Job answered the LORD:
19590	29	40	4	40	4	“Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You? I place my hand over my mouth.
19591	29	40	5	40	5	I have spoken once, but I have no answer—twice, but I have nothing to add.”
19592	29	40	6	40	6	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
19593	29	40	7	40	7	“Now brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me.
19594	29	40	8	40	8	Would you really annul My justice? Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?
19595	29	40	9	40	9	Do you have an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
19596	29	40	10	40	10	Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, and clothe yourself with honor and glory.
19597	29	40	11	40	11	Unleash the fury of your wrath; look on every proud man and bring him low.
19598	29	40	12	40	12	Look on every proud man and humble him; trample the wicked where they stand.
19599	29	40	13	40	13	Bury them together in the dust; imprison them in the grave.
19600	29	40	14	40	14	Then I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you.
19601	29	40	15	40	15	Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you. He feeds on grass like an ox.
19602	29	40	16	40	16	See the strength of his loins and the power in the muscles of his belly.
19603	29	40	17	40	17	His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
19604	29	40	18	40	18	His bones are tubes of bronze; his limbs are rods of iron.
19605	29	40	19	40	19	He is the foremost of God’s works; only his Maker can draw the sword against him.
19606	29	40	20	40	20	The hills yield him their produce, while all the beasts of the field play nearby.
19607	29	40	21	40	21	He lies under the lotus plants, hidden among the reeds of the marsh.
19608	29	40	22	40	22	The lotus plants conceal him in their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.
19609	29	40	23	40	23	Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid; he remains secure, though the Jordan surges to his mouth.
19610	29	40	24	40	24	Can anyone capture him as he looks on, or pierce his nose with a snare?”
19611	29	40	25	41	1	“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
19612	29	40	26	41	2	Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
19613	29	40	27	41	3	Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?
19614	29	40	28	41	4	Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?
19615	29	40	29	41	5	Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?
19616	29	40	30	41	6	Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?
19617	29	40	31	41	7	Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
19618	29	40	32	41	8	If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!
19619	29	41	1	41	9	Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?
19620	29	41	2	41	10	No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?
19621	29	41	3	41	11	Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.
19622	29	41	4	41	12	I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.
19623	29	41	5	41	13	Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?
19624	29	41	6	41	14	Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?
19625	29	41	7	41	15	His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.
19626	29	41	8	41	16	One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.
19627	29	41	9	41	17	They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.
19628	29	41	10	41	18	His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
19629	29	41	11	41	19	Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!
19630	29	41	12	41	20	Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
19631	29	41	13	41	21	His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.
19632	29	41	14	41	22	Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.
19633	29	41	15	41	23	The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
19634	29	41	16	41	24	His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!
19635	29	41	17	41	25	When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.
19636	29	41	18	41	26	The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.
19637	29	41	19	41	27	He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.
19638	29	41	20	41	28	No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.
19639	29	41	21	41	29	A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.
19640	29	41	22	41	30	His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.
19641	29	41	23	41	31	He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
19642	29	41	24	41	32	He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!
19643	29	41	25	41	33	Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature devoid of fear!
19644	29	41	26	41	34	He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”
19645	29	42	1	42	1	Then Job replied to the LORD:
19646	29	42	2	42	2	“I know that You can do all things and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
19647	29	42	3	42	3	You asked, ‘Who is this who conceals My counsel without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
19648	29	42	4	42	4	You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak. I will question you, and you shall answer.’
19649	29	42	5	42	5	My ears had heard of You, but now my eyes have seen You.
19650	29	42	6	42	6	Therefore I retract my words, and I repent in dust and ashes.”
19651	29	42	7	42	7	After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends. For you have not spoken about Me accurately, as My servant Job has.
19652	29	42	8	42	8	So now, take seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.”
19653	29	42	9	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job’s request.
19654	29	42	10	42	10	After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his prosperity and doubled his former possessions.
19655	29	42	11	42	11	All his brothers and sisters and prior acquaintances came and dined with him in his house. They consoled him and comforted him over all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. And each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
19656	29	42	12	42	12	So the LORD blessed Job’s latter days more than his first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
19657	29	42	13	42	13	And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
19658	29	42	14	42	14	He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch.
19659	29	42	15	42	15	No women as beautiful as Job’s daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers.
19660	29	42	16	42	16	After this, Job lived 140 years and saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
19661	29	42	17	42	17	And so Job died, old and full of years.
19662	30	1	1	1	1	This is Solomon’s Song of Songs.
19663	30	1	2	1	2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is more delightful than wine.
19664	30	1	3	1	3	The fragrance of your perfume is pleasing; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens adore you.
19665	30	1	4	1	4	Take me away with you—let us hurry! May the king bring me to his chambers. We will rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. It is only right that they adore you.
19666	30	1	5	1	5	I am dark, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
19667	30	1	6	1	6	Do not stare because I am dark, for the sun has gazed upon me. My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me a keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have neglected.
19668	30	1	7	1	7	Tell me, O one I love, where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you rest them at midday? Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions?
19669	30	1	8	1	8	If you do not know, O fairest of women, follow the tracks of the flock, and graze your young goats near the tents of the shepherds.
19670	30	1	9	1	9	I compare you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.
19671	30	1	10	1	10	Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
19672	30	1	11	1	11	We will make you ornaments of gold, studded with beads of silver.
19673	30	1	12	1	12	While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
19674	30	1	13	1	13	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
19675	30	1	14	1	14	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.
19676	30	1	15	1	15	How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.
19677	30	1	16	1	16	How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how delightful! The soft grass is our bed.
19678	30	1	17	1	17	The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are fragrant firs.
19679	30	2	1	2	1	I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valley.
19680	30	2	2	2	2	Like a lily among the thorns is my darling among the maidens.
19681	30	2	3	2	3	Like an apricot tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
19682	30	2	4	2	4	He has brought me to the house of wine, and his banner over me is love.
19683	30	2	5	2	5	Sustain me with raisins; refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
19684	30	2	6	2	6	His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
19685	30	2	7	2	7	O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.
19686	30	2	8	2	8	Listen! My beloved approaches. Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.
19687	30	2	9	2	9	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
19688	30	2	10	2	10	My beloved calls to me, “Arise, my darling. Come away with me, my beautiful one.
19689	30	2	11	2	11	For now the winter is past; the rain is over and gone.
19690	30	2	12	2	12	The flowers have appeared in the countryside; the season of singing has come, and the cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.
19691	30	2	13	2	13	The fig tree ripens its figs; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come away, my darling; come away with me, my beautiful one.”
19692	30	2	14	2	14	O my dove in the clefts of the rock, in the crevices of the cliff, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your countenance is lovely.
19693	30	2	15	2	15	Catch for us the foxes—the little foxes that ruin the vineyards—for our vineyards are in bloom.
19694	30	2	16	2	16	My beloved is mine and I am his; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
19695	30	2	17	2	17	Before the day breaks and shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.
19696	30	3	1	3	1	On my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.
19697	30	3	2	3	2	I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and squares. I will seek the one I love. So I sought him but did not find him.
19698	30	3	3	3	3	I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city: “Have you seen the one I love?”
19699	30	3	4	3	4	I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held him and would not let go until I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.
19700	30	3	5	3	5	O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.
19701	30	3	6	3	6	Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?
19702	30	3	7	3	7	Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty of the mightiest men of Israel.
19703	30	3	8	3	8	All are skilled with the sword, experienced in warfare. Each has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of the night.
19704	30	3	9	3	9	King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.
19705	30	3	10	3	10	He has made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric. Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
19706	30	3	11	3	11	Come out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother bestowed on the day of his wedding—the day of his heart’s rejoicing.
19707	30	4	1	4	1	How beautiful you are, my darling! How very beautiful! Your eyes are like doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.
19708	30	4	2	4	2	Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.
19709	30	4	3	4	3	Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon, and your mouth is lovely. Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.
19710	30	4	4	4	4	Your neck is like the tower of David, built with rows of stones; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
19711	30	4	5	4	5	Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle grazing among the lilies.
19712	30	4	6	4	6	Before the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
19713	30	4	7	4	7	You are altogether beautiful, my darling; in you there is no flaw.
19714	30	4	8	4	8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon! Descend from the peak of Amana, from the summits of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.
19715	30	4	9	4	9	You have captured my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your neck.
19716	30	4	10	4	10	How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride. Your love is much better than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than all spices.
19717	30	4	11	4	11	Your lips, my bride, drip sweetness like the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue, and the fragrance of your garments is like the aroma of Lebanon.
19718	30	4	12	4	12	My sister, my bride, you are a garden locked up, a spring enclosed, a fountain sealed.
19719	30	4	13	4	13	Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates with the choicest of fruits, with henna and nard,
19720	30	4	14	4	14	with nard and saffron, with calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of frankincense tree, with myrrh and aloes, with all the finest spices.
19721	30	4	15	4	15	You are a garden spring, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
19722	30	4	16	4	16	Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind. Breathe on my garden and spread the fragrance of its spices. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choicest fruits.
19723	30	5	1	5	1	I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink freely, O beloved.
19724	30	5	2	5	2	I sleep, but my heart is awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”
19725	30	5	3	5	3	I have taken off my robe—must I put it back on? I have washed my feet—must I soil them again?
19726	30	5	4	5	4	My beloved put his hand to the latch; my heart pounded for him.
19727	30	5	5	5	5	I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.
19728	30	5	6	5	6	I opened for my beloved, but he had turned and gone. My heart sank at his departure. I sought him, but did not find him. I called, but he did not answer.
19729	30	5	7	5	7	I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city. They beat me and bruised me; they took away my cloak, those guardians of the walls.
19730	30	5	8	5	8	O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you, if you find my beloved, tell him I am sick with love.
19731	30	5	9	5	9	How is your beloved better than others, O most beautiful among women? How is your beloved better than another, that you charge us so?
19732	30	5	10	5	10	My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.
19733	30	5	11	5	11	His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
19734	30	5	12	5	12	His eyes are like doves beside the streams of water, bathed in milk and mounted like jewels.
19735	30	5	13	5	13	His cheeks are like beds of spice, towers of perfume. His lips are like lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.
19736	30	5	14	5	14	His arms are rods of gold set with beryl. His body is an ivory panel bedecked with sapphires.
19737	30	5	15	5	15	His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars.
19738	30	5	16	5	16	His mouth is most sweet; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
19739	30	6	1	6	1	Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.
19740	30	6	2	6	2	My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies.
19741	30	6	3	6	3	I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
19742	30	6	4	6	4	You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.
19743	30	6	5	6	5	Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.
19744	30	6	6	6	6	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.
19745	30	6	7	6	7	Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.
19746	30	6	8	6	8	There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,
19747	30	6	9	6	9	but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.
19748	30	6	10	6	10	Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?
19749	30	6	11	6	11	I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding or the pomegranates were in bloom.
19750	30	6	12	6	12	Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the royal chariots of my people.
19751	30	7	1	6	13	Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?
19752	30	7	2	7	1	How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master.
19753	30	7	3	7	2	Your navel is a rounded goblet; it never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by the lilies.
19754	30	7	4	7	3	Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
19755	30	7	5	7	4	Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus.
19756	30	7	6	7	5	Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple threads; the king is captured in your tresses.
19757	30	7	7	7	6	How fair and pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!
19758	30	7	8	7	7	Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit.
19759	30	7	9	7	8	I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,
19760	30	7	10	7	9	and your mouth like the finest wine. May it flow smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth.
19761	30	7	11	7	10	I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.
19762	30	7	12	7	11	Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside; let us spend the night among the wildflowers.
19763	30	7	13	7	12	Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love.
19764	30	7	14	7	13	The mandrakes send forth a fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old, that I have treasured up for you, my beloved.
19765	30	8	1	8	1	O that you were to me like a brother who nursed at my mother’s breasts! If I found you outdoors, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
19766	30	8	2	8	2	I would lead you and bring you to the house of my mother who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
19767	30	8	3	8	3	His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
19768	30	8	4	8	4	O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.
19769	30	8	5	8	5	Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? I roused you under the apple tree; there your mother conceived you; there she travailed and brought you forth.
19770	30	8	6	8	6	Set me as a seal over your heart, as a seal upon your arm. For love is as strong as death, its jealousy as unrelenting as Sheol. Its sparks are fiery flames, the fiercest blaze of all.
19771	30	8	7	8	7	Mighty waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, his offer would be utterly scorned.
19772	30	8	8	8	8	We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
19773	30	8	9	8	9	If she is a wall, we will build a tower of silver to protect her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
19774	30	8	10	8	10	I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. So I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace.
19775	30	8	11	8	11	Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He leased it to the tenants. For its fruit, each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver.
19776	30	8	12	8	12	But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
19777	30	8	13	8	13	You who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening for your voice. Let me hear it!
19778	30	8	14	8	14	Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
19779	31	1	1	1	1	In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab.
19780	31	1	2	1	2	The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah, and they entered the land of Moab and settled there.
19781	31	1	3	1	3	Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons,
19782	31	1	4	1	4	who took Moabite women as their wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. And after they had lived in Moab about ten years,
19783	31	1	5	1	5	both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband.
19784	31	1	6	1	6	When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab.
19785	31	1	7	1	7	Accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah.
19786	31	1	8	1	8	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s home. May the LORD show you loving devotion, as you have shown to your dead and to me.
19787	31	1	9	1	9	May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.” And she kissed them as they wept aloud
19788	31	1	10	1	10	and said, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”
19789	31	1	11	1	11	But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands?
19790	31	1	12	1	12	Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,
19791	31	1	13	1	13	would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”
19792	31	1	14	1	14	Again they wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
19793	31	1	15	1	15	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; follow her back home.”
19794	31	1	16	1	16	But Ruth replied: “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn from following you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
19795	31	1	17	1	17	Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me, and ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.”
19796	31	1	18	1	18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her.
19797	31	1	19	1	19	So Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole city was stirred because of them, and the women of the city exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”
19798	31	1	20	1	20	“Do not call me Naomi,” she replied. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with me.
19799	31	1	21	1	21	I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? After all, the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me.”
19800	31	1	22	1	22	So Naomi returned from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
19801	31	2	1	2	1	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.
19802	31	2	2	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain after someone in whose sight I may find favor.” “Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi replied.
19803	31	2	3	2	3	So Ruth departed and went out into the field and gleaned after the harvesters. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.
19804	31	2	4	2	4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, “The LORD be with you.” “The LORD bless you,” they replied.
19805	31	2	5	2	5	And Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?”
19806	31	2	6	2	6	The foreman answered, “She is the Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.
19807	31	2	7	2	7	She has said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the harvesters.’ So she came out and has continued from morning until now, except that she rested a short time in the shelter.”
19808	31	2	8	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go and glean in another field, and do not go away from this place, but stay here close to my servant girls.
19809	31	2	9	2	9	Let your eyes be on the field they are harvesting, and follow along after these girls. Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled.”
19810	31	2	10	2	10	At this, she fell on her face, bowing low to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you should take notice of me, even though I am a foreigner?”
19811	31	2	11	2	11	Boaz replied, “I have been made fully aware of all you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and how you came to a people you did not know before.
19812	31	2	12	2	12	May the LORD repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge.”
19813	31	2	13	2	13	“My lord,” she said, “may I continue to find favor in your eyes, for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your servant girls.”
19814	31	2	14	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here; have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.” So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left over.
19815	31	2	15	2	15	When Ruth got up to glean, Boaz ordered his young men, “Even if she gathers among the sheaves, do not insult her.
19816	31	2	16	2	16	Rather, pull out for her some stalks from the bundles and leave them for her to gather. Do not rebuke her.”
19817	31	2	17	2	17	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. And when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an ephah of barley.
19818	31	2	18	2	18	She picked up the grain and went into the town, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out what she had saved from her meal and gave it to Naomi.
19819	31	2	19	2	19	Then her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be the man who noticed you.” So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.
19820	31	2	20	2	20	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead.” Naomi continued, “The man is a close relative. He is one of our kinsman-redeemers.”
19821	31	2	21	2	21	Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also told me, ‘Stay with my young men until they have finished gathering all my harvest.’”
19822	31	2	22	2	22	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “My daughter, it is good for you to work with his young women, so that nothing will happen to you in another field.”
19823	31	2	23	2	23	So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean grain until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
19824	31	3	1	3	1	One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a resting place for you, that it may be well with you?
19825	31	3	2	3	2	Now is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been working, a relative of ours? In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
19826	31	3	3	3	3	Therefore wash yourself, put on perfume, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but do not let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
19827	31	3	4	3	4	When he lies down, note the place where he lies. Then go in and uncover his feet, and lie down, and he will explain to you what you should do.”
19828	31	3	5	3	5	“I will do everything you say,” Ruth answered.
19829	31	3	6	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do.
19830	31	3	7	3	7	After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then Ruth went in secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
19831	31	3	8	3	8	At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman!
19832	31	3	9	3	9	“Who are you?” he asked. “I am your servant Ruth,” she replied. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, for you are a kinsman-redeemer.”
19833	31	3	10	3	10	Then Boaz said, “May the LORD bless you, my daughter. You have shown more kindness now than before, because you have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
19834	31	3	11	3	11	And now do not be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you request, since all my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character.
19835	31	3	12	3	12	Yes, it is true that I am a kinsman-redeemer, but there is a redeemer nearer than I.
19836	31	3	13	3	13	Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, good. Let him redeem you. But if he does not want to redeem you, as surely as the LORD lives, I will. Now lie here until morning.”
19837	31	3	14	3	14	So she lay down at his feet until morning, but she got up before anyone else could recognize her. Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”
19838	31	3	15	3	15	And he told her, “Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he shoveled six measures of barley into her shawl. Then he went into the city.
19839	31	3	16	3	16	When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, “How did it go, my daughter?” Then Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her.
19840	31	3	17	3	17	And she said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”
19841	31	3	18	3	18	“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go, for he will not rest unless he has resolved the matter today.”
19842	31	4	1	4	1	Meanwhile, Boaz went to the gate and sat down there. Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along, and Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
19843	31	4	2	4	2	Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.
19844	31	4	3	4	3	And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
19845	31	4	4	4	4	I thought I should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” “I will redeem it,” he replied.
19846	31	4	5	4	5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”
19847	31	4	6	4	6	The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.”
19848	31	4	7	4	7	Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was a confirmation in Israel.
19849	31	4	8	4	8	So the kinsman-redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.”
19850	31	4	9	4	9	At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.
19851	31	4	10	4	10	Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today.”
19852	31	4	11	4	11	“We are witnesses,” said the elders and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem.
19853	31	4	12	4	12	And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.”
19854	31	4	13	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
19855	31	4	14	4	14	Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel.
19856	31	4	15	4	15	He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”
19857	31	4	16	4	16	And Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him.
19858	31	4	17	4	17	The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David.
19859	31	4	18	4	18	Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
19860	31	4	19	4	19	Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab,
19861	31	4	20	4	20	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon,
19862	31	4	21	4	21	Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boaz was the father of Obed,
19863	31	4	22	4	22	Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.
19864	32	1	1	1	1	How lonely lies the city, once so full of people! She who was great among the nations has become a widow. The princess of the provinces has become a slave.
19865	32	1	2	1	2	She weeps aloud in the night, with tears upon her cheeks. Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
19866	32	1	3	1	3	Judah has gone into exile under affliction and harsh slavery; she dwells among the nations but finds no place to rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her in the midst of her distress.
19867	32	1	4	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn, because no one comes to her appointed feasts. All her gates are deserted; her priests groan, her maidens grieve, and she herself is bitter with anguish.
19868	32	1	5	1	5	Her foes have become her masters; her enemies are at ease. For the LORD has brought her grief because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone away as captives before the enemy.
19869	32	1	6	1	6	All the splendor has departed from the Daughter of Zion. Her princes are like deer that find no pasture; they lack the strength to flee in the face of the hunter.
19870	32	1	7	1	7	In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old. When her people fell into enemy hands she received no help. Her enemies looked upon her, laughing at her downfall.
19871	32	1	8	1	8	Jerusalem has sinned greatly; therefore she has become an object of scorn. All who honored her now despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; she herself groans and turns away.
19872	32	1	9	1	9	Her uncleanness stains her skirts; she did not consider her end. Her downfall was astounding; there was no one to comfort her. Look, O LORD, on my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!
19873	32	1	10	1	10	The adversary has seized all her treasures. For she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary—those You had forbidden to enter Your assembly.
19874	32	1	11	1	11	All her people groan as they search for bread. They have traded their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. Look, O LORD, and consider, for I have become despised.
19875	32	1	12	1	12	Is this nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see! Is there any sorrow like mine, which was inflicted on me, which the LORD made me suffer on the day of His fierce anger?
19876	32	1	13	1	13	He sent fire from on high, and it overpowered my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all the day long.
19877	32	1	14	1	14	My transgressions are bound into a yoke, knit together by His hand; they have come upon my neck, and the Lord has broken my strength. He has delivered me into the hands of those I cannot withstand.
19878	32	1	15	1	15	The Lord has rejected all the mighty men in my midst; He has summoned an army against me to crush my young warriors. Like grapes in a winepress, the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
19879	32	1	16	1	16	For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears. For there is no one nearby to comfort me, no one to revive my soul. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.
19880	32	1	17	1	17	Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. The LORD has decreed against Jacob that his neighbors become his foes. Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them.
19881	32	1	18	1	18	The LORD is righteous, for I have rebelled against His command. Listen, all you people; look upon my suffering. My young men and maidens have gone into captivity.
19882	32	1	19	1	19	I called out to my lovers, but they have betrayed me. My priests and elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive.
19883	32	1	20	1	20	See, O LORD, how distressed I am! I am churning within; my heart is pounding within me, for I have been most rebellious. Outside, the sword bereaves; inside, there is death.
19884	32	1	21	1	21	People have heard my groaning, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that You have caused it. May You bring the day You have announced, so that they may become like me.
19885	32	1	22	1	22	Let all their wickedness come before You, and deal with them as You have dealt with me because of all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and my heart is faint.
19886	32	2	1	2	1	How the Lord has covered the Daughter of Zion with His cloud of anger! He has cast the glory of Israel from heaven to earth. He has abandoned His footstool in the day of His anger.
19887	32	2	2	2	2	Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob. In His wrath He has demolished the fortified cities of the Daughter of Judah. He brought to the ground and defiled her kingdom and its princes.
19888	32	2	3	2	3	In fierce anger He has cut off every horn of Israel and withdrawn His right hand at the approach of the enemy. He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it.
19889	32	2	4	2	4	He has bent His bow like an enemy; His right hand is positioned. Like a foe He has killed all who were pleasing to the eye; He has poured out His wrath like fire on the tent of the Daughter of Zion.
19890	32	2	5	2	5	The Lord is like an enemy; He has swallowed up Israel. He swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.
19891	32	2	6	2	6	He has laid waste His tabernacle like a garden booth; He has destroyed His place of meeting. The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and Sabbaths. In His fierce anger He has despised both king and priest.
19892	32	2	7	2	7	The Lord has rejected His altar; He has abandoned His sanctuary; He has delivered the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy. They have raised a shout in the house of the LORD as on the day of an appointed feast.
19893	32	2	8	2	8	The LORD determined to destroy the wall of the Daughter of Zion. He stretched out a measuring line and did not withdraw His hand from destroying. He made the ramparts and walls lament; together they waste away.
19894	32	2	9	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and shattered their bars. Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations, the law is no more, and even her prophets find no vision from the LORD.
19895	32	2	10	2	10	The elders of the Daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence. They have thrown dust on their heads and put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.
19896	32	2	11	2	11	My eyes fail from weeping; I am churning within. My heart is poured out in grief over the destruction of the daughter of my people, because children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
19897	32	2	12	2	12	They cry out to their mothers: “Where is the grain and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city, as their lives fade away in the arms of their mothers.
19898	32	2	13	2	13	What can I say for you? To what can I compare you, O Daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you, that I may console you, O Virgin Daughter of Zion? For your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can ever heal you?
19899	32	2	14	2	14	The visions of your prophets were empty and deceptive; they did not expose your guilt to ward off your captivity. The burdens they envisioned for you were empty and misleading.
19900	32	2	15	2	15	All who pass by clap their hands at you in scorn. They hiss and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem: “Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?”
19901	32	2	16	2	16	All your enemies open their mouths against you. They hiss and gnash their teeth, saying, “We have swallowed her up. This is the day for which we have waited. We have lived to see it!”
19902	32	2	17	2	17	The LORD has done what He planned; He has accomplished His decree, which He ordained in days of old; He has overthrown you without pity. He has let the enemy gloat over you and exalted the horn of your foes.
19903	32	2	18	2	18	The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord. O wall of the Daughter of Zion, let your tears run down like a river day and night. Give yourself no relief, and your eyes no rest.
19904	32	2	19	2	19	Arise, cry out in the night from the first watch of the night. Pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord. Lift up your hands to Him for the lives of your children who are fainting from hunger on the corner of every street.
19905	32	2	20	2	20	Look, O LORD, and consider: Whom have You ever treated like this? Should women eat their offspring, the infants they have nurtured? Should priests and prophets be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
19906	32	2	21	2	21	Both young and old lie together in the dust of the streets. My young men and maidens have fallen by the sword. You have slain them in the day of Your anger; You have slaughtered them without compassion.
19907	32	2	22	2	22	You summoned my attackers on every side, as for the day of an appointed feast. In the day of the LORD’s anger no one escaped or survived; my enemy has destroyed those I nurtured and reared.
19908	32	3	1	3	1	I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath.
19909	32	3	2	3	2	He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light.
19910	32	3	3	3	3	Indeed, He keeps turning His hand against me all day long.
19911	32	3	4	3	4	He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones.
19912	32	3	5	3	5	He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.
19913	32	3	6	3	6	He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages.
19914	32	3	7	3	7	He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains.
19915	32	3	8	3	8	Even when I cry out and plead for help, He shuts out my prayer.
19916	32	3	9	3	9	He has barred my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked.
19917	32	3	10	3	10	He is a bear lying in wait, a lion hiding in ambush.
19918	32	3	11	3	11	He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces; He left me without help.
19919	32	3	12	3	12	He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow.
19920	32	3	13	3	13	He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.
19921	32	3	14	3	14	I am a laughingstock to all my people; they mock me in song all day long.
19922	32	3	15	3	15	He has filled me with bitterness; He has intoxicated me with wormwood.
19923	32	3	16	3	16	He has ground my teeth with gravel and trampled me in the dust.
19924	32	3	17	3	17	My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.
19925	32	3	18	3	18	So I say, “My strength has perished, along with my hope from the LORD.”
19926	32	3	19	3	19	Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall.
19927	32	3	20	3	20	Surely my soul remembers and is humbled within me.
19928	32	3	21	3	21	Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope:
19929	32	3	22	3	22	Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail.
19930	32	3	23	3	23	They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!
19931	32	3	24	3	24	“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in Him.”
19932	32	3	25	3	25	The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.
19933	32	3	26	3	26	It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
19934	32	3	27	3	27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young.
19935	32	3	28	3	28	Let him sit alone in silence, for God has disciplined him.
19936	32	3	29	3	29	Let him bury his face in the dust—perhaps there is still hope.
19937	32	3	30	3	30	Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with reproach.
19938	32	3	31	3	31	For the Lord will not cast us off forever.
19939	32	3	32	3	32	Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion.
19940	32	3	33	3	33	For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men.
19941	32	3	34	3	34	To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,
19942	32	3	35	3	35	to deny a man justice before the Most High,
19943	32	3	36	3	36	to subvert a man in his lawsuit—of these the Lord does not approve.
19944	32	3	37	3	37	Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?
19945	32	3	38	3	38	Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
19946	32	3	39	3	39	Why should any mortal man complain, in view of his sins?
19947	32	3	40	3	40	Let us examine and test our ways, and turn back to the LORD.
19948	32	3	41	3	41	Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:
19949	32	3	42	3	42	“We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.”
19950	32	3	43	3	43	You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without pity.
19951	32	3	44	3	44	You have covered Yourself with a cloud that no prayer can pass through.
19952	32	3	45	3	45	You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.
19953	32	3	46	3	46	All our enemies open their mouths against us.
19954	32	3	47	3	47	Panic and pitfall have come upon us—devastation and destruction.
19955	32	3	48	3	48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people.
19956	32	3	49	3	49	My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief,
19957	32	3	50	3	50	until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.
19958	32	3	51	3	51	My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
19959	32	3	52	3	52	Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird.
19960	32	3	53	3	53	They dropped me alive into a pit and cast stones upon me.
19961	32	3	54	3	54	The waters flowed over my head, and I thought I was going to die.
19962	32	3	55	3	55	I called on Your name, O LORD, out of the depths of the Pit.
19963	32	3	56	3	56	You heard my plea: “Do not ignore my cry for relief.”
19964	32	3	57	3	57	You drew near when I called on You; You said, “Do not be afraid.”
19965	32	3	58	3	58	You defend my cause, O Lord; You redeem my life.
19966	32	3	59	3	59	You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me; vindicate my cause!
19967	32	3	60	3	60	You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.
19968	32	3	61	3	61	O LORD, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me—
19969	32	3	62	3	62	the slander and murmuring of my assailants against me all day long.
19970	32	3	63	3	63	When they sit and when they rise, see how they mock me in song.
19971	32	3	64	3	64	You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
19972	32	3	65	3	65	Put a veil of anguish over their hearts; may Your curse be upon them!
19973	32	3	66	3	66	You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them from under Your heavens, O LORD.
19974	32	4	1	4	1	How the gold has become tarnished, the pure gold has become dull! The gems of the temple lie scattered on every street corner.
19975	32	4	2	4	2	How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in pure gold, are now esteemed as jars of clay, the work of a potter’s hands!
19976	32	4	3	4	3	Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like an ostrich in the wilderness.
19977	32	4	4	4	4	The nursing infant’s tongue clings in thirst to the roof of his mouth. Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.
19978	32	4	5	4	5	Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets; those brought up in crimson huddle in ash heaps.
19979	32	4	6	4	6	The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand turned to help her.
19980	32	4	7	4	7	Her dignitaries were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires.
19981	32	4	8	4	8	But now their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.
19982	32	4	9	4	9	Those slain by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger, who waste away, pierced with pain because the fields lack produce.
19983	32	4	10	4	10	The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
19984	32	4	11	4	11	The LORD has exhausted His wrath; He has poured out His fierce anger; He has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has consumed her foundations.
19985	32	4	12	4	12	The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any people of the world, that an enemy or a foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
19986	32	4	13	4	13	But this was for the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst.
19987	32	4	14	4	14	They wandered blind in the streets, defiled by this blood, so that no one dared to touch their garments.
19988	32	4	15	4	15	“Go away! Unclean!” men shouted at them. “Away, away! Do not touch us!” So they fled and wandered. Among the nations it was said, “They can stay here no longer.”
19989	32	4	16	4	16	The presence of the LORD has scattered them; He regards them no more. The priests are shown no honor; the elders find no favor.
19990	32	4	17	4	17	All the while our eyes were failing as we looked in vain for help. We watched from our towers for a nation that could not save us.
19991	32	4	18	4	18	They stalked our every step, so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end drew near, our time ran out, for our end had come!
19992	32	4	19	4	19	Those who chased us were swifter than the eagles in the sky; they pursued us over the mountains and ambushed us in the wilderness.
19993	32	4	20	4	20	The LORD’s anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their pits. We had said of him, “Under his shadow we will live among the nations.”
19994	32	4	21	4	21	So rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. Yet the cup will pass to you as well; you will get drunk and expose yourself.
19995	32	4	22	4	22	O Daughter of Zion, your punishment is complete; He will not prolong your exile. But He will punish your iniquity, O Daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins.
19996	32	5	1	5	1	Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us. Look and see our disgrace!
19997	32	5	2	5	2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.
19998	32	5	3	5	3	We have become fatherless orphans; our mothers are widows.
19999	32	5	4	5	4	We must buy the water we drink; our wood comes at a price.
20000	32	5	5	5	5	We are closely pursued; we are weary and find no rest.
20001	32	5	6	5	6	We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.
20002	32	5	7	5	7	Our fathers sinned and are no more, but we bear their punishment.
20003	32	5	8	5	8	Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hands.
20004	32	5	9	5	9	We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.
20005	32	5	10	5	10	Our skin is as hot as an oven because of the burning of famine.
20006	32	5	11	5	11	Women have been ravished in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.
20007	32	5	12	5	12	Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders receive no respect.
20008	32	5	13	5	13	Young men toil at millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.
20009	32	5	14	5	14	The elders have left the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.
20010	32	5	15	5	15	Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
20011	32	5	16	5	16	The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!
20012	32	5	17	5	17	Because of this, our hearts are faint; because of these, our eyes grow dim—
20013	32	5	18	5	18	because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, patrolled by foxes.
20014	32	5	19	5	19	You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation.
20015	32	5	20	5	20	Why have You forgotten us forever? Why have You forsaken us for so long?
20016	32	5	21	5	21	Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, so we may return; renew our days as of old,
20017	32	5	22	5	22	unless You have utterly rejected us and remain angry with us beyond measure.
20018	33	1	1	1	1	The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
20019	33	1	2	1	2	“Futility of futilities,” says the Teacher, “futility of futilities! Everything is futile!”
20020	33	1	3	1	3	What does a man gain from all his labor, at which he toils under the sun?
20021	33	1	4	1	4	Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.
20022	33	1	5	1	5	The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries back to where it arose.
20023	33	1	6	1	6	The wind blows southward, then turns northward; round and round it swirls, ever returning on its course.
20024	33	1	7	1	7	All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place from which the streams come, there again they flow.
20025	33	1	8	1	8	All things are wearisome, more than one can describe; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear content with hearing.
20026	33	1	9	1	9	What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
20027	33	1	10	1	10	Is there a case where one can say, “Look, this is new”? It has already existed in the ages before us.
20028	33	1	11	1	11	There is no remembrance of those who came before, and those to come will not be remembered by those who follow after.
20029	33	1	12	1	12	I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
20030	33	1	13	1	13	And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on the sons of men to keep them occupied!
20031	33	1	14	1	14	I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.
20032	33	1	15	1	15	What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.
20033	33	1	16	1	16	I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”
20034	33	1	17	1	17	So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.
20035	33	1	18	1	18	For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, and as knowledge grows, grief increases.
20036	33	2	1	2	1	I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good!” But it proved to be futile.
20037	33	2	2	2	2	I said of laughter, “It is folly,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
20038	33	2	3	2	3	I sought to cheer my body with wine and to embrace folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—until I could see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
20039	33	2	4	2	4	I expanded my pursuits. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
20040	33	2	5	2	5	I made gardens and parks for myself, where I planted all kinds of fruit trees.
20041	33	2	6	2	6	I built reservoirs to water my groves of flourishing trees.
20042	33	2	7	2	7	I acquired menservants and maidservants, and servants were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me,
20043	33	2	8	2	8	and I accumulated for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered to myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men—many concubines.
20044	33	2	9	2	9	So I became great and surpassed all in Jerusalem who had preceded me; and my wisdom remained with me.
20045	33	2	10	2	10	Anything my eyes desired, I did not deny myself. I refused my heart no pleasure. For my heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.
20046	33	2	11	2	11	Yet when I considered all the works that my hands had accomplished and what I had toiled to achieve, I found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind; there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
20047	33	2	12	2	12	Then I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what more can the king’s successor do than what has already been accomplished?
20048	33	2	13	2	13	And I saw that wisdom exceeds folly, just as light exceeds darkness:
20049	33	2	14	2	14	The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also came to realize that one fate overcomes them both.
20050	33	2	15	2	15	So I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?” And I said to myself that this too is futile.
20051	33	2	16	2	16	For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise, just as with the fool, seeing that both will be forgotten in the days to come. Alas, the wise man will die just like the fool!
20052	33	2	17	2	17	So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
20053	33	2	18	2	18	I hated all for which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
20054	33	2	19	2	19	And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will take over all the labor at which I have worked skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.
20055	33	2	20	2	20	So my heart began to despair over all the labor that I had done under the sun.
20056	33	2	21	2	21	When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great evil.
20057	33	2	22	2	22	For what does a man get for all the labor and endeavors at which he toils under the sun?
20058	33	2	23	2	23	Indeed, all his days are filled with grief, and his task is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.
20059	33	2	24	2	24	Nothing is better for a man than to eat and drink and enjoy his work. I have also seen that this is from the hand of God.
20060	33	2	25	2	25	For apart from Him, who can eat and who can find enjoyment?
20061	33	2	26	2	26	To the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He assigns the task of gathering and accumulating that which he will hand over to one who pleases God. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
20062	33	3	1	3	1	To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
20063	33	3	2	3	2	a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,
20064	33	3	3	3	3	a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and a time to build,
20065	33	3	4	3	4	a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,
20066	33	3	5	3	5	a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
20067	33	3	6	3	6	a time to search and a time to count as lost, a time to keep and a time to discard,
20068	33	3	7	3	7	a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,
20069	33	3	8	3	8	a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.
20070	33	3	9	3	9	What does the worker gain from his toil?
20071	33	3	10	3	10	I have seen the burden that God has laid on men to occupy them.
20072	33	3	11	3	11	He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom the work that God has done from beginning to end.
20073	33	3	12	3	12	I know that there is nothing better for men than to rejoice and do good while they live,
20074	33	3	13	3	13	and also that every man should eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his labor—this is the gift of God.
20075	33	3	14	3	14	I know that everything God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God does it so that men should fear Him.
20076	33	3	15	3	15	What exists has already been, and what will be has already been, for God will call to account what has passed.
20077	33	3	16	3	16	Furthermore, I saw under the sun that in the place of judgment there is wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness.
20078	33	3	17	3	17	I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every deed.”
20079	33	3	18	3	18	I said to myself, “As for the sons of men, God tests them so that they may see for themselves that they are but beasts.”
20080	33	3	19	3	19	For the fates of both men and beasts are the same: As one dies, so dies the other—they all have the same breath. Man has no advantage over the animals, since everything is futile.
20081	33	3	20	3	20	All go to one place; all come from dust, and all return to dust.
20082	33	3	21	3	21	Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and the spirit of the animal descends into the earth?
20083	33	3	22	3	22	I have seen that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will come after him?
20084	33	4	1	4	1	Again I looked, and I considered all the oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter.
20085	33	4	2	4	2	So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive.
20086	33	4	3	4	3	But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
20087	33	4	4	4	4	I saw that all labor and success spring from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
20088	33	4	5	4	5	The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
20089	33	4	6	4	6	Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.
20090	33	4	7	4	7	Again, I saw futility under the sun.
20091	33	4	8	4	8	There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?” This too is futile—a miserable task.
20092	33	4	9	4	9	Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.
20093	33	4	10	4	10	For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up!
20094	33	4	11	4	11	Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone?
20095	33	4	12	4	12	And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
20096	33	4	13	4	13	Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning.
20097	33	4	14	4	14	For the youth has come from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.
20098	33	4	15	4	15	I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed this second one, the youth who succeeded the king.
20099	33	4	16	4	16	There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in the successor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
20100	33	4	17	5	1	Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.
20101	33	5	1	5	2	Do not be quick to speak, and do not let your heart hastily utter a word before God. After all, God is in heaven and you are on earth. So let your words be few.
20102	33	5	2	5	3	As a dream comes through many cares, so the speech of a fool comes with many words.
20103	33	5	3	5	4	When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it, because He takes no pleasure in fools. Fulfill your vow.
20104	33	5	4	5	5	It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.
20105	33	5	5	5	6	Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not tell the messenger that your vow was a mistake. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?
20106	33	5	6	5	7	For as many dreams bring futility, so do many words. Therefore, fear God.
20107	33	5	7	5	8	If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be astonished at the matter; for one official is watched by a superior, and higher still are over them.
20108	33	5	8	5	9	The produce of the earth is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
20109	33	5	9	5	10	He who loves money is never satisfied by money, and he who loves wealth is never satisfied by income. This too is futile.
20110	33	5	10	5	11	When good things increase, so do those who consume them; what then is the profit to the owner, except to behold them with his eyes?
20111	33	5	11	5	12	The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich man permits him no sleep.
20112	33	5	12	5	13	There is a grievous evil I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner,
20113	33	5	13	5	14	or wealth lost in a failed venture, so that when that man has a son there is nothing to pass on.
20114	33	5	14	5	15	As a man came from his mother’s womb, so he will depart again, naked as he arrived. He takes nothing for his labor to carry in his hands.
20115	33	5	15	5	16	This too is a grievous evil: Exactly as a man is born, so he will depart. What does he gain as he toils for the wind?
20116	33	5	16	5	17	Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness, with much sorrow, sickness, and anger.
20117	33	5	17	5	18	Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in all the labor one does under the sun during the few days of life that God has given him—for this is his lot.
20118	33	5	18	5	19	Furthermore, God has given riches and wealth to every man, and He has enabled him to enjoy them, to accept his lot, and to rejoice in his labor. This is a gift from God.
20119	33	5	19	5	20	For a man seldom considers the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
20120	33	6	1	6	1	There is another evil I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon mankind:
20121	33	6	2	6	2	God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a grievous affliction.
20122	33	6	3	6	3	A man may father a hundred children and live for many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
20123	33	6	4	6	4	For he enters in futility and departs in darkness, and his name is shrouded in obscurity.
20124	33	6	5	6	5	A stillborn child has more rest than he—though never seeing the sun or knowing anything—
20125	33	6	6	6	6	if he lives a thousand years twice over, but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
20126	33	6	7	6	7	All a man’s labor is for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.
20127	33	6	8	6	8	What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool? What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?
20128	33	6	9	6	9	Better what the eye can see than the wandering of desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
20129	33	6	10	6	10	Whatever exists was named long ago, and what happens to a man is foreknown; but he cannot contend with one stronger than he.
20130	33	6	11	6	11	For the more words, the more futility—and how does that profit anyone?
20131	33	6	12	6	12	For who knows what is good for a man during the few days in which he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?
20132	33	7	1	7	1	A good name is better than fine perfume, and one’s day of death is better than his day of birth.
20133	33	7	2	7	2	It is better to enter a house of mourning than a house of feasting, since death is the end of every man, and the living should take this to heart.
20134	33	7	3	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter, for a sad countenance is good for the heart.
20135	33	7	4	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
20136	33	7	5	7	5	It is better to heed a wise man’s rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.
20137	33	7	6	7	6	For like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.
20138	33	7	7	7	7	Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
20139	33	7	8	7	8	The end of a matter is better than the beginning, and a patient spirit is better than a proud one.
20140	33	7	9	7	9	Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger settles in the lap of a fool.
20141	33	7	10	7	10	Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is unwise of you to ask about this.
20142	33	7	11	7	11	Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good, and it benefits those who see the sun.
20143	33	7	12	7	12	For wisdom, like money, is a shelter, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
20144	33	7	13	7	13	Consider the work of God: Who can straighten what He has bent?
20145	33	7	14	7	14	In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider this: God has made one of these along with the other, so that a man cannot discover anything that will come after him.
20146	33	7	15	7	15	In my futile life I have seen both of these: A righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
20147	33	7	16	7	16	Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
20148	33	7	17	7	17	Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
20149	33	7	18	7	18	It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings.
20150	33	7	19	7	19	Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers in a city.
20151	33	7	20	7	20	Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
20152	33	7	21	7	21	Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you.
20153	33	7	22	7	22	For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
20154	33	7	23	7	23	All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me.
20155	33	7	24	7	24	What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it?
20156	33	7	25	7	25	I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness.
20157	33	7	26	7	26	And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared.
20158	33	7	27	7	27	“Behold,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation.
20159	33	7	28	7	28	While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found a virtuous woman.
20160	33	7	29	7	29	Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made men upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”
20161	33	8	1	8	1	Who is like the wise man? Who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom brightens his face, and the sternness of his face is changed.
20162	33	8	2	8	2	Keep the king’s command, I say, because of your oath before God.
20163	33	8	3	8	3	Do not hasten to leave his presence, and do not persist in a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.
20164	33	8	4	8	4	For the king’s word is supreme, and who can say to him, “What are you doing?”
20165	33	8	5	8	5	Whoever keeps his command will come to no harm, and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure.
20166	33	8	6	8	6	For there is a right time and procedure to every purpose, though a man’s misery weighs heavily upon him.
20167	33	8	7	8	7	Since no one knows what will happen, who can tell him what is to come?
20168	33	8	8	8	8	As no man has power over the wind to contain it, so no one has authority over his day of death. As no one can be discharged in wartime, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
20169	33	8	9	8	9	All this I have seen, applying my mind to every deed that is done under the sun; there is a time when one man lords it over another to his own detriment.
20170	33	8	10	8	10	Then too, I saw the burial of the wicked who used to go in and out of the holy place, and they were praised in the city where they had done so. This too is futile.
20171	33	8	11	8	11	When the sentence for a crime is not speedily executed, the hearts of men become fully set on doing evil.
20172	33	8	12	8	12	Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and still lives long, yet I also know that it will go well with those who fear God, who are reverent in His presence.
20173	33	8	13	8	13	Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
20174	33	8	14	8	14	There is a futility that is done on the earth: There are righteous men who get what the actions of the wicked deserve, and there are wicked men who get what the actions of the righteous deserve. I say that this too is futile.
20175	33	8	15	8	15	So I commended the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be merry. For this joy will accompany him in his labor during the days of his life that God gives him under the sun.
20176	33	8	16	8	16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the task that one performs on the earth—though his eyes do not see sleep in the day or even in the night—
20177	33	8	17	8	17	I saw every work of God, and that a man is unable to comprehend the work that is done under the sun. Despite his efforts to search it out, he cannot find its meaning; even if the wise man claims to know, he is unable to comprehend.
20178	33	9	1	9	1	So I took all this to heart and concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in God’s hands. Man does not know what lies ahead, whether love or hate.
20179	33	9	2	9	2	It is the same for all: There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the bad, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who makes a vow, so it is for the one who refuses to take a vow.
20180	33	9	3	9	3	This is an evil in everything that is done under the sun: There is one fate for everyone. Furthermore, the hearts of men are full of evil and madness while they are alive, and afterward they join the dead.
20181	33	9	4	9	4	There is hope, however, for anyone who is among the living; for even a live dog is better than a dead lion.
20182	33	9	5	9	5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, because the memory of them is forgotten.
20183	33	9	6	9	6	Their love, their hate, and their envy have already vanished, and they will never again have a share in all that is done under the sun.
20184	33	9	7	9	7	Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already approved your works:
20185	33	9	8	9	8	Let your garments always be white, and never spare the oil for your head.
20186	33	9	9	9	9	Enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of the fleeting life that God has given you under the sun—all your fleeting days. For this is your portion in life and in your labor under the sun.
20187	33	9	10	9	10	Whatever you find to do with your hands, do it with all your might, for in Sheol, where you are going, there is no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.
20188	33	9	11	9	11	I saw something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; neither is the bread to the wise, nor the wealth to the intelligent, nor the favor to the skillful. For time and chance happen to all.
20189	33	9	12	9	12	For surely no man knows his time: Like fish caught in a cruel net or birds trapped in a snare, so men are ensnared in an evil time that suddenly falls upon them.
20190	33	9	13	9	13	I have also seen this wisdom under the sun, and it was great to me:
20191	33	9	14	9	14	There was a small city with few men. A mighty king came against it, surrounded it, and built large siege ramps against it.
20192	33	9	15	9	15	Now a poor wise man was found in the city, and he saved the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
20193	33	9	16	9	16	And I said, “Wisdom is better than strength, but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heeded.”
20194	33	9	17	9	17	The calm words of the wise are heeded over the shouts of a ruler among fools.
20195	33	9	18	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
20196	33	10	1	10	1	As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
20197	33	10	2	10	2	A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.
20198	33	10	3	10	3	Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.
20199	33	10	4	10	4	If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.
20200	33	10	5	10	5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun—an error that proceeds from the ruler:
20201	33	10	6	10	6	Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions.
20202	33	10	7	10	7	I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.
20203	33	10	8	10	8	He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.
20204	33	10	9	10	9	The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself.
20205	33	10	10	10	10	If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success.
20206	33	10	11	10	11	If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.
20207	33	10	12	10	12	The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.
20208	33	10	13	10	13	The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness.
20209	33	10	14	10	14	Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him?
20210	33	10	15	10	15	The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.
20211	33	10	16	10	16	Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning.
20212	33	10	17	10	17	Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness.
20213	33	10	18	10	18	Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.
20214	33	10	19	10	19	A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.
20215	33	10	20	10	20	Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.
20216	33	11	1	11	1	Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.
20217	33	11	2	11	2	Divide your portion among seven, or even eight, for you do not know what disaster may befall the land.
20218	33	11	3	11	3	If the clouds are full, they will pour out rain upon the earth; whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will lie.
20219	33	11	4	11	4	He who watches the wind will fail to sow, and he who observes the clouds will fail to reap.
20220	33	11	5	11	5	As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the bones are formed in a mother’s womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.
20221	33	11	6	11	6	Sow your seed in the morning, and do not rest your hands in the evening, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or if both will equally prosper.
20222	33	11	7	11	7	Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
20223	33	11	8	11	8	So if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is futile.
20224	33	11	9	11	9	Rejoice, O young man, while you are young, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
20225	33	11	10	11	10	So banish sorrow from your heart, and cast off pain from your body, for youth and vigor are fleeting.
20226	33	12	1	12	1	Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of adversity come and the years approach of which you will say, “I find no pleasure in them,”
20227	33	12	2	12	2	before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is darkened, and the clouds return after the rain,
20228	33	12	3	12	3	on the day the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men stoop, when those grinding cease because they are few and those watching through windows see dimly,
20229	33	12	4	12	4	when the doors to the street are shut and the sound of the mill fades away, when one rises at the sound of a bird and all the daughters of song grow faint,
20230	33	12	5	12	5	when men fear the heights and dangers of the road, when the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper loses its spring, and the caper berry shrivels—for then man goes to his eternal home and mourners walk the streets.
20231	33	12	6	12	6	Remember Him before the silver cord is snapped and the golden bowl is crushed, before the pitcher is shattered at the spring and the wheel is broken at the well,
20232	33	12	7	12	7	before the dust returns to the ground from which it came and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
20233	33	12	8	12	8	“Futility of futilities,” says the Teacher. “Everything is futile!”
20234	33	12	9	12	9	Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also taught the people knowledge; he pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs.
20235	33	12	10	12	10	The Teacher searched to find delightful sayings and to record accurate words of truth.
20236	33	12	11	12	11	The words of the wise are like goads, and the anthologies of the masters are like firmly embedded nails driven by a single Shepherd.
20237	33	12	12	12	12	And by these, my son, be further warned: There is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.
20238	33	12	13	12	13	When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this: Fear God and keep His commandments, because this is the whole duty of man.
20239	33	12	14	12	14	For God will bring every deed into judgment, along with every hidden thing, whether good or evil.
20240	34	1	1	1	1	This is what happened in the days of Xerxes, who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
20241	34	1	2	1	2	In those days King Xerxes sat on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa.
20242	34	1	3	1	3	In the third year of his reign, Xerxes held a feast for all his officials and servants. The military leaders of Persia and Media were there, along with the nobles and princes of the provinces.
20243	34	1	4	1	4	And for a full 180 days he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness.
20244	34	1	5	1	5	At the end of this time, in the garden court of the royal palace, the king held a seven-day feast for all the people in the citadel of Susa, from the least to the greatest.
20245	34	1	6	1	6	Hangings of white and blue linen were fastened with cords of fine white and purple material to silver rings on the marble pillars. Gold and silver couches were arranged on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones.
20246	34	1	7	1	7	Beverages were served in an array of goblets of gold, each with a different design, and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty.
20247	34	1	8	1	8	By order of the king, no limit was placed on the drinking, and every official of his household was to serve each man whatever he desired.
20248	34	1	9	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
20249	34	1	10	1	10	On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was merry with wine, he ordered the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—
20250	34	1	11	1	11	to bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown, to display her beauty to the people and officials. For she was beautiful to behold.
20251	34	1	12	1	12	Queen Vashti, however, refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs. And the king became furious, and his anger burned within him.
20252	34	1	13	1	13	Then the king consulted the wise men who knew the times, for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice.
20253	34	1	14	1	14	His closest advisors were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and ranked highest in the kingdom.
20254	34	1	15	1	15	“According to law,” he asked, “what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey the command of King Xerxes delivered by the eunuchs?”
20255	34	1	16	1	16	And in the presence of the king and his princes, Memucan replied, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but all the princes and the peoples in all the provinces of King Xerxes.
20256	34	1	17	1	17	For the conduct of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to despise their husbands and say, ‘King Xerxes ordered Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’
20257	34	1	18	1	18	This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard about the queen’s conduct will say the same thing to all the king’s officials, resulting in much contempt and wrath.
20258	34	1	19	1	19	So if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree, and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed, that Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes, and her royal position shall be given to a woman better than she.
20259	34	1	20	1	20	The edict the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom—and so all women, from the least to the greatest, will honor their husbands.”
20260	34	1	21	1	21	The king and his princes were pleased with this counsel; so the king did as Memucan had advised.
20261	34	1	22	1	22	He sent letters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, proclaiming that every man should be master of his own household.
20262	34	2	1	2	1	Some time later, when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what had been decreed against her.
20263	34	2	2	2	2	Then the king’s attendants proposed, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king,
20264	34	2	3	2	3	and let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, and let them be given beauty treatments.
20265	34	2	4	2	4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king become queen in place of Vashti.” This suggestion pleased the king, and he acted accordingly.
20266	34	2	5	2	5	Now there was at the citadel of Susa a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish.
20267	34	2	6	2	6	He had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah.
20268	34	2	7	2	7	And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, because she did not have a father or mother. The young woman was lovely in form and appearance, and when her father and mother had died, Mordecai had taken her in as his own daughter.
20269	34	2	8	2	8	When the king’s command and edict had been proclaimed, many young women gathered at the citadel of Susa under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the palace and placed under the care of Hegai, the custodian of the women.
20270	34	2	9	2	9	And the young woman pleased him and obtained his favor, so he quickly provided her with beauty treatments and the special diet. He assigned to her seven select maidservants from the palace and transferred her with them to the best place in the harem.
20271	34	2	10	2	10	Esther did not reveal her people or her lineage, because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.
20272	34	2	11	2	11	And every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem to learn about Esther’s welfare and what was happening to her.
20273	34	2	12	2	12	In the twelve months before her turn to go to King Xerxes, the harem regulation required each young woman to receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months, and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months.
20274	34	2	13	2	13	When the young woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.
20275	34	2	14	2	14	She would go there in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second harem under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he delighted in her and summoned her by name.
20276	34	2	15	2	15	Now Esther was the daughter of Abihail, the uncle from whom Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter. And when it was her turn to go to the king, she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king’s trusted official in charge of the harem, had advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her.
20277	34	2	16	2	16	She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
20278	34	2	17	2	17	And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all of the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown upon her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.
20279	34	2	18	2	18	Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants. He proclaimed a tax holiday in the provinces and gave gifts worthy of the king’s bounty.
20280	34	2	19	2	19	When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate.
20281	34	2	20	2	20	Esther still had not revealed her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed. She obeyed Mordecai’s command, as she had done under his care.
20282	34	2	21	2	21	In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, grew angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
20283	34	2	22	2	22	When Mordecai learned of the plot, he reported it to Queen Esther, and she informed the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
20284	34	2	23	2	23	After the report had been investigated and verified, both officials were hanged on the gallows. And all this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.
20285	34	3	1	3	1	After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him to a position above all the princes who were with him.
20286	34	3	2	3	2	All the royal servants at the King’s Gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, because the king had commanded that this be done for him. But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage.
20287	34	3	3	3	3	Then the royal servants at the King’s Gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the command of the king?”
20288	34	3	4	3	4	Day after day they warned him, but he would not comply. So they reported it to Haman to see whether Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, since he had told them he was a Jew.
20289	34	3	5	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or pay him homage, he was filled with rage.
20290	34	3	6	3	6	And when he learned the identity of Mordecai’s people, he scorned the notion of laying hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he sought to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the kingdom of Xerxes.
20291	34	3	7	3	7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman to determine a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
20292	34	3	8	3	8	Then Haman informed King Xerxes, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples of every province of your kingdom. Their laws are different from everyone else’s, and they do not obey the king’s laws. So it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them.
20293	34	3	9	3	9	If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will deposit ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury to pay those who carry it out.”
20294	34	3	10	3	10	So the king removed the signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
20295	34	3	11	3	11	“Keep your money,” said the king to Haman. “These people are given to you to do with them as you please.”
20296	34	3	12	3	12	On the thirteenth day of the first month, the royal scribes were summoned and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded the royal satraps, the governors of each province, and the officials of each people, in the script of each province and the language of every people. It was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the royal signet ring.
20297	34	3	13	3	13	And the letters were sent by couriers to each of the royal provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—and to plunder their possessions on a single day, the thirteenth day of Adar, the twelfth month.
20298	34	3	14	3	14	A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued in every province and published to all the people, so that they would be ready for that day.
20299	34	3	15	3	15	The couriers left, spurred on by the king’s command, and the law was issued in the citadel of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in confusion.
20300	34	4	1	4	1	When Mordecai learned of all that had happened, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
20301	34	4	2	4	2	But he went only as far as the King’s Gate, because the law prohibited anyone wearing sackcloth from entering that gate.
20302	34	4	3	4	3	In every province to which the king’s command and edict came, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and lamented, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
20303	34	4	4	4	4	When Esther’s maidens and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, the queen was overcome with distress. She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
20304	34	4	5	4	5	Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs appointed to her, and she dispatched him to Mordecai to learn what was troubling him and why.
20305	34	4	6	4	6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the King’s Gate,
20306	34	4	7	4	7	and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury in order to destroy the Jews.
20307	34	4	8	4	8	Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for the destruction of the Jews, to show and explain to Esther, urging her to approach the king, implore his favor, and plead before him for her people.
20308	34	4	9	4	9	So Hathach went back and relayed Mordecai’s response to Esther.
20309	34	4	10	4	10	Then Esther spoke to Hathach and instructed him to tell Mordecai,
20310	34	4	11	4	11	“All the royal officials and the people of the king’s provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned—that he be put to death. Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live. But I have not been summoned to appear before the king for the past thirty days.”
20311	34	4	12	4	12	When Esther’s words were relayed to Mordecai,
20312	34	4	13	4	13	he sent back to her this reply: “Do not imagine that because you are in the king’s palace you alone will escape the fate of all the Jews.
20313	34	4	14	4	14	For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows if perhaps you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”
20314	34	4	15	4	15	Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
20315	34	4	16	4	16	“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink day or night for three days, and I and my maidens will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish!”
20316	34	4	17	4	17	So Mordecai went and did all that Esther had instructed him.
20317	34	5	1	5	1	On the third day, Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace across from the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing the entrance.
20318	34	5	2	5	2	As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight. The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
20319	34	5	3	5	3	“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king inquired. “What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given to you.”
20320	34	5	4	5	4	“If it pleases the king,” Esther replied, “may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for the king.”
20321	34	5	5	5	5	“Hurry,” commanded the king, “and bring Haman, so we can do as Esther has requested.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
20322	34	5	6	5	6	And as they drank their wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.”
20323	34	5	7	5	7	Esther replied, “This is my petition and my request:
20324	34	5	8	5	8	If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, may the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”
20325	34	5	9	5	9	That day Haman went out full of joy and glad of heart. At the King’s Gate, however, he saw Mordecai, who did not rise or tremble in fear at his presence. And Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.
20326	34	5	10	5	10	Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh,
20327	34	5	11	5	11	Haman recounted to them his glorious wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored and promoted him over the other officials and servants.
20328	34	5	12	5	12	“What is more,” Haman added, “Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she prepared, and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king.
20329	34	5	13	5	13	Yet none of this satisfies me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King’s Gate.”
20330	34	5	14	5	14	His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, “Have them build a gallows fifty cubits high, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself.” The advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed.
20331	34	6	1	6	1	That night, sleep escaped the king; so he ordered the Book of Records, the Chronicles, to be brought in and read to him.
20332	34	6	2	6	2	And there it was found recorded that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the king’s entrance, when they had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
20333	34	6	3	6	3	The king inquired, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?” “Nothing has been done for him,” replied the king’s attendants.
20334	34	6	4	6	4	“Who is in the court?” the king asked. Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.
20335	34	6	5	6	5	So the king’s attendants answered him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” “Bring him in,” ordered the king.
20336	34	6	6	6	6	Haman entered, and the king asked him, “What should be done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor?” Now Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king be delighted to honor more than me?”
20337	34	6	7	6	7	And Haman told the king, “For the man whom the king is delighted to honor,
20338	34	6	8	6	8	have them bring a royal robe that the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden—one with a royal crest placed on its head.
20339	34	6	9	6	9	Let the robe and the horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them array the man the king wants to honor and parade him on the horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!’”
20340	34	6	10	6	10	“Hurry,” said the king to Haman, “and do just as you proposed. Take the robe and the horse to Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the King’s Gate. Do not neglect anything that you have suggested.”
20341	34	6	11	6	11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai, and paraded him through the city square, crying out before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!”
20342	34	6	12	6	12	Then Mordecai returned to the King’s Gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief.
20343	34	6	13	6	13	Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is Jewish, you will not prevail against him—for surely you will fall before him.”
20344	34	6	14	6	14	While they were still speaking with Haman, the king’s eunuchs arrived and rushed him to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
20345	34	7	1	7	1	So the king and Haman went to dine with Esther the queen,
20346	34	7	2	7	2	and as they drank their wine on that second day, the king asked once more, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.”
20347	34	7	3	7	3	Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, grant me my life as my petition, and the lives of my people as my request.
20348	34	7	4	7	4	For my people and I have been sold out to destruction, death, and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants, I would have remained silent, because no such distress would justify burdening the king.”
20349	34	7	5	7	5	Then King Xerxes spoke up and asked Queen Esther, “Who is this, and where is the one who would devise such a scheme?”
20350	34	7	6	7	6	Esther replied, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked man—Haman!” And Haman stood in terror before the king and queen.
20351	34	7	7	7	7	In his fury, the king arose from drinking his wine and went to the palace garden, while Haman stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king was planning a terrible fate for him.
20352	34	7	8	7	8	Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, “Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?” As soon as the words had left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
20353	34	7	9	7	9	Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said: “There is a gallows fifty cubits high at Haman’s house. He had it built for Mordecai, who gave the report that saved the king.” “Hang him on it!” declared the king.
20354	34	7	10	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the fury of the king subsided.
20355	34	8	1	8	1	That same day King Xerxes awarded Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai entered the king’s presence because Esther had revealed his relation to her.
20356	34	8	2	8	2	The king removed the signet ring he had recovered from Haman and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed Mordecai over the estate of Haman.
20357	34	8	3	8	3	And once again, Esther addressed the king. She fell at his feet weeping and begged him to revoke the evil scheme of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews.
20358	34	8	4	8	4	The king extended the gold scepter toward Esther, and she arose and stood before the king.
20359	34	8	5	8	5	“If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if I have found favor in his sight, and the matter seems proper to the king, and I am pleasing in his sight, may an order be written to revoke the letters that the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.
20360	34	8	6	8	6	For how could I bear to see the disaster that would befall my people? How could I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”
20361	34	8	7	8	7	So King Xerxes said to Esther the Queen and Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given Haman’s estate to Esther, and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the Jews.
20362	34	8	8	8	8	Now you may write in the king’s name as you please regarding the Jews, and seal it with the royal signet ring. For a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked.”
20363	34	8	9	8	9	At once the royal scribes were summoned, and on the twenty-third day of the third month (the month of Sivan), they recorded all of Mordecai’s orders to the Jews and to the satraps, governors, and princes of the 127 provinces from India to Cush—writing to each province in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language.
20364	34	8	10	8	10	Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes and sealed it with the royal signet ring. He sent the documents by mounted couriers riding on swift horses bred from the royal mares.
20365	34	8	11	8	11	By these letters the king permitted the Jews in each and every city the right to assemble and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province hostile to them, including women and children, and to plunder their possessions.
20366	34	8	12	8	12	The single day appointed throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
20367	34	8	13	8	13	A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples so that the Jews would be prepared on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
20368	34	8	14	8	14	The couriers rode out in haste on their royal horses, pressed on by the command of the king. And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.
20369	34	8	15	8	15	Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal garments of blue and white, with a large gold crown and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
20370	34	8	16	8	16	For the Jews it was a time of light and gladness, of joy and honor.
20371	34	8	17	8	17	In every province and every city, wherever the king’s edict and decree reached, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many of the people of the land themselves became Jews, because the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
20372	34	9	1	9	1	On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the king’s command and edict were to be executed. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but their plan was overturned and the Jews overpowered those who hated them.
20373	34	9	2	9	2	In each of the provinces of King Xerxes, the Jews assembled in their cities to attack those who sought to harm them. No man could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.
20374	34	9	3	9	3	And all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the king’s administrators helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them.
20375	34	9	4	9	4	For Mordecai exercised great power in the palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces as he became more and more powerful.
20376	34	9	5	9	5	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did as they pleased to those who hated them.
20377	34	9	6	9	6	In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,
20378	34	9	7	9	7	including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
20379	34	9	8	9	8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
20380	34	9	9	9	9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
20381	34	9	10	9	10	They killed these ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
20382	34	9	11	9	11	On that day the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king,
20383	34	9	12	9	12	who said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men, including Haman’s ten sons. What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given to you. And what further do you request? It will be fulfilled.”
20384	34	9	13	9	13	Esther replied, “If it pleases the king, may the Jews in Susa also have tomorrow to carry out today’s edict, and may the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
20385	34	9	14	9	14	So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.
20386	34	9	15	9	15	On the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, the Jews in Susa came together again and put to death three hundred men there, but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.
20387	34	9	16	9	16	The rest of the Jews in the royal provinces also assembled to defend themselves and rid themselves of their enemies. They killed 75,000 who hated them, but did not lay a hand on the plunder.
20388	34	9	17	9	17	This was done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested, making it a day of feasting and joy.
20389	34	9	18	9	18	The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. So they rested on the fifteenth day, making it a day of feasting and joy.
20390	34	9	19	9	19	This is why the rural Jews, who live in the villages, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting. It is a holiday for sending gifts to one another.
20391	34	9	20	9	20	Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Xerxes, both near and far,
20392	34	9	21	9	21	to establish among them an annual celebration on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
20393	34	9	22	9	22	as the days on which the Jews gained rest from their enemies and the month in which their sorrow turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday. He wrote that these were to be days of feasting and joy, of sending gifts to one another and to the poor.
20394	34	9	23	9	23	So the Jews agreed to continue the custom they had started, as Mordecai had written to them.
20395	34	9	24	9	24	For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the Pur (that is, the lot) to crush and destroy them.
20396	34	9	25	9	25	But when it came before the king, he commanded by letter that the wicked scheme which Haman had devised against the Jews should come back upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
20397	34	9	26	9	26	Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word Pur. Because of all the instructions in this letter, and because of all they had seen and experienced,
20398	34	9	27	9	27	the Jews bound themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should not fail to celebrate these two days at the appointed time each and every year, according to their regulation.
20399	34	9	28	9	28	These days should be remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews, nor should the memory of them fade from their descendants.
20400	34	9	29	9	29	So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
20401	34	9	30	9	30	And Mordecai sent letters with words of peace and truth to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes,
20402	34	9	31	9	31	in order to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them and had committed themselves and their descendants to the times of fasting and lamentation.
20403	34	9	32	9	32	So Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, which were written into the record.
20404	34	10	1	10	1	Now King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the land, even to its farthest shores.
20405	34	10	2	10	2	And all of Mordecai’s powerful and magnificent accomplishments, together with the full account of the greatness to which the king had raised him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?
20406	34	10	3	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews and highly favored by his many kinsmen, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his countrymen.
20407	35	1	1	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
20408	35	1	2	1	2	And the Lord delivered into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with some of the articles from the house of God. He carried these off to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, where he put them in the treasury of his god.
20409	35	1	3	1	3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials, to bring in some Israelites from the royal family and the nobility—
20410	35	1	4	1	4	young men without blemish, handsome, gifted in all wisdom, knowledgeable, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace—and to teach them the language and literature of the Chaldeans.
20411	35	1	5	1	5	The king assigned them daily provisions of the royal food and wine. They were to be trained for three years, after which they were to enter the king’s service.
20412	35	1	6	1	6	Among these young men were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
20413	35	1	7	1	7	The chief official gave them new names: To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.
20414	35	1	8	1	8	But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king’s food or wine. So he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself.
20415	35	1	9	1	9	Now God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official,
20416	35	1	10	1	10	but he said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age? You would endanger my head before the king!”
20417	35	1	11	1	11	Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
20418	35	1	12	1	12	“Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given only vegetables to eat and water to drink.
20419	35	1	13	1	13	Then compare our appearances with those of the young men who are eating the royal food, and deal with your servants according to what you see.”
20420	35	1	14	1	14	So he consented to this and tested them for ten days.
20421	35	1	15	1	15	And at the end of ten days, they looked healthier and better nourished than all the young men who were eating the king’s food.
20422	35	1	16	1	16	So the steward continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables instead.
20423	35	1	17	1	17	To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. And Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams.
20424	35	1	18	1	18	Now at the end of the time specified by the king, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.
20425	35	1	19	1	19	And the king spoke with them, and among all the young men he found no one equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the king’s service.
20426	35	1	20	1	20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.
20427	35	1	21	1	21	And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
20428	35	2	1	2	1	In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled his spirit, and sleep escaped him.
20429	35	2	2	2	2	So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers to explain his dreams. When they came and stood before the king,
20430	35	2	3	2	3	he said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand it.”
20431	35	2	4	2	4	Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, “O king, may you live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”
20432	35	2	5	2	5	The king replied to the astrologers, “My word is final: If you do not tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut into pieces and your houses will be reduced to rubble.
20433	35	2	6	2	6	But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.”
20434	35	2	7	2	7	They answered a second time, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will give the interpretation.”
20435	35	2	8	2	8	The king replied, “I know for sure that you are stalling for time, because you see that my word is final.
20436	35	2	9	2	9	If you do not tell me the dream, there is only one decree for you. You have conspired to speak before me false and fraudulent words, hoping the situation will change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can give me its interpretation.”
20437	35	2	10	2	10	The astrologers answered the king, “No one on earth can do what the king requests! No king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.
20438	35	2	11	2	11	What the king requests is so difficult that no one can tell it to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”
20439	35	2	12	2	12	This response made the king so furious with anger that he gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
20440	35	2	13	2	13	So the decree went out that the wise men were to be executed, and men went to look for Daniel and his friends to execute them.
20441	35	2	14	2	14	When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel replied with discretion and tact.
20442	35	2	15	2	15	“Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” he asked. At this time Arioch explained the situation to Daniel.
20443	35	2	16	2	16	So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give him the interpretation.
20444	35	2	17	2	17	Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
20445	35	2	18	2	18	urging them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
20446	35	2	19	2	19	During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision, and he blessed the God of heaven
20447	35	2	20	2	20	and declared: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.
20448	35	2	21	2	21	He changes the times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
20449	35	2	22	2	22	He reveals the deep and hidden things; He knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with Him.
20450	35	2	23	2	23	To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, because You have given me wisdom and power. And now You have made known to me what we have requested, for You have made known to us the dream of the king.”
20451	35	2	24	2	24	Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.”
20452	35	2	25	2	25	Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who will tell the king the interpretation.”
20453	35	2	26	2	26	The king responded to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me what I saw in the dream, as well as its interpretation?”
20454	35	2	27	2	27	Daniel answered the king, “No wise man, enchanter, medium, or magician can explain to the king the mystery of which he inquires.
20455	35	2	28	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these:
20456	35	2	29	2	29	As you lay on your bed, O king, your thoughts turned to the future, and the Revealer of Mysteries made known to you what will happen.
20457	35	2	30	2	30	And to me this mystery has been revealed, not because I have more wisdom than any man alive, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.
20458	35	2	31	2	31	As you, O king, were watching, a great statue appeared. A great and dazzling statue stood before you, and its form was awesome.
20459	35	2	32	2	32	The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze,
20460	35	2	33	2	33	its legs were iron, and its feet were part iron and part clay.
20461	35	2	34	2	34	As you watched, a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and crushed them.
20462	35	2	35	2	35	Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were shattered and became like chaff on the threshing floor in summer. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
20463	35	2	36	2	36	This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.
20464	35	2	37	2	37	You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and glory.
20465	35	2	38	2	38	Wherever the sons of men or beasts of the field or birds of the air dwell, He has given them into your hand and has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.
20466	35	2	39	2	39	But after you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule the whole earth.
20467	35	2	40	2	40	Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; for iron shatters and crushes all things, and like iron that crushes all things, it will shatter and crush all the others.
20468	35	2	41	2	41	And just as you saw that the feet and toes were made partly of fired clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom, yet some of the strength of iron will be in it—just as you saw the iron mixed with clay.
20469	35	2	42	2	42	And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
20470	35	2	43	2	43	As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so the peoples will mix with one another, but will not hold together any more than iron mixes with clay.
20471	35	2	44	2	44	In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will shatter all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself stand forever.
20472	35	2	45	2	45	And just as you saw a stone being cut out of the mountain without human hands, and it shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold, so the great God has told the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”
20473	35	2	46	2	46	At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, paid homage to Daniel, and ordered that an offering of incense be presented to him.
20474	35	2	47	2	47	The king said to Daniel, “Your God is truly the God of gods and Lord of kings, the Revealer of Mysteries, since you were able to reveal this mystery.”
20475	35	2	48	2	48	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.
20476	35	2	49	2	49	And at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the king’s court.
20477	35	3	1	3	1	King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
20478	35	3	2	3	2	Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up.
20479	35	3	3	3	3	So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
20480	35	3	4	3	4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “O people of every nation and language, this is what you are commanded:
20481	35	3	5	3	5	As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
20482	35	3	6	3	6	And whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.”
20483	35	3	7	3	7	Therefore, as soon as all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, the people of every nation and language would fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
20484	35	3	8	3	8	At this time some astrologers came forward and maliciously accused the Jews,
20485	35	3	9	3	9	saying to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, may you live forever!
20486	35	3	10	3	10	You, O king, have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the golden statue,
20487	35	3	11	3	11	and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.
20488	35	3	12	3	12	But there are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who have ignored you, O king, and have refused to serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.”
20489	35	3	13	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar, furious with rage, summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,
20490	35	3	14	3	14	and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden statue I have set up?
20491	35	3	15	3	15	Now, if you are ready, as soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the statue I have made. But if you refuse to worship, you will be thrown at once into the blazing fiery furnace. Then what god will be able to deliver you from my hands?”
20492	35	3	16	3	16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
20493	35	3	17	3	17	If the God whom we serve exists, then He is able to deliver us from the blazing fiery furnace and from your hand, O king.
20494	35	3	18	3	18	But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.”
20495	35	3	19	3	19	At this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual,
20496	35	3	20	3	20	and he commanded some mighty men of valor in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing fiery furnace.
20497	35	3	21	3	21	So they were tied up, wearing robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and they were thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.
20498	35	3	22	3	22	The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the fiery flames killed the men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
20499	35	3	23	3	23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, firmly bound, fell into the blazing fiery furnace.
20500	35	3	24	3	24	Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and asked his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, firmly bound, into the fire?” “Certainly, O king,” they replied.
20501	35	3	25	3	25	“Look!” he exclaimed. “I see four men, unbound and unharmed, walking around in the fire—and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!”
20502	35	3	26	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing fiery furnace and called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,
20503	35	3	27	3	27	and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them.
20504	35	3	28	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar declared, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
20505	35	3	29	3	29	Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut into pieces and their houses reduced to rubble. For there is no other god who can deliver in this way.”
20506	35	3	30	3	30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
20507	35	3	31	4	1	King Nebuchadnezzar, To the people of every nation and language who dwell in all the earth: May your prosperity be multiplied.
20508	35	3	32	4	2	I am pleased to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me.
20509	35	3	33	4	3	How great are His signs, how mighty His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; His dominion endures from generation to generation.
20510	35	4	1	4	4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
20511	35	4	2	4	5	I had a dream, and it frightened me; while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.
20512	35	4	3	4	6	So I issued a decree that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me.
20513	35	4	4	4	7	When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners came in, I told them the dream, and they could not interpret it for me.
20514	35	4	5	4	8	But at last, into my presence came Daniel (whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods). And I told him the dream:
20515	35	4	6	4	9	“O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery baffles you. So explain to me the visions I saw in my dream, and their interpretation.
20516	35	4	7	4	10	In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this come to pass: There was a tree in the midst of the land, and its height was great.
20517	35	4	8	4	11	The tree grew large and strong; its top reached the sky, and it was visible to the ends of the earth.
20518	35	4	9	4	12	Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant, and upon it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, in its branches the birds of the air nested, and from it every creature was fed.
20519	35	4	10	4	13	As I lay on my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven.
20520	35	4	11	4	14	He called out in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
20521	35	4	12	4	15	But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth.
20522	35	4	13	4	16	Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the mind of a beast till seven times pass him by.
20523	35	4	14	4	17	This decision is the decree of the watchers, the verdict declared by the holy ones, so that the living will know that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of mankind, and He gives it to whom He wishes, setting over it the lowliest of men.’
20524	35	4	15	4	18	This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you are able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
20525	35	4	16	4	19	For a time, Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar, was perplexed, and his thoughts alarmed him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.” “My lord,” replied Belteshazzar, “may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!
20526	35	4	17	4	20	The tree you saw that grew large and strong, whose top reached the sky and was visible to all the earth,
20527	35	4	18	4	21	whose foliage was beautiful and whose fruit was abundant, providing food for all, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in whose branches the birds of the air nested—
20528	35	4	19	4	22	you, O king, are that tree! For you have become great and strong; your greatness has grown to reach the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.
20529	35	4	20	4	23	And you, O king, saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying: ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and graze with the beasts of the field till seven times pass him by.’
20530	35	4	21	4	24	This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree that the Most High has issued against my lord the king:
20531	35	4	22	4	25	You will be driven away from mankind, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field. You will feed on grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass you by, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of mankind, and He gives it to whom He wishes.
20532	35	4	23	4	26	As for the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules.
20533	35	4	24	4	27	Therefore, may my advice be pleasing to you, O king. Break away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed. Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.”
20534	35	4	25	4	28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
20535	35	4	26	4	29	Twelve months later, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
20536	35	4	27	4	30	the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great, which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?”
20537	35	4	28	4	31	While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “It is decreed to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that the kingdom has departed from you.
20538	35	4	29	4	32	You will be driven away from mankind to live with the beasts of the field, and you will feed on grass like an ox. And seven times will pass you by, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of mankind, and He gives it to whom He wishes.”
20539	35	4	30	4	33	At that moment the sentence against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from mankind. He ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.
20540	35	4	31	4	34	But at the end of those days I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity was restored to me. Then I praised the Most High, and I honored and glorified Him who lives forever: “For His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.
20541	35	4	32	4	35	All the peoples of the earth are counted as nothing, and He does as He pleases with the army of heaven and the peoples of the earth. There is no one who can restrain His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’”
20542	35	4	33	4	36	At the same time my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne, and surpassing greatness was added to me.
20543	35	4	34	4	37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all His works are true and all His ways are just. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.
20544	35	5	1	5	1	Later, King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them.
20545	35	5	2	5	2	Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king could drink from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.
20546	35	5	3	5	3	Thus they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king drank from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.
20547	35	5	4	5	4	As they drank the wine, they praised their gods of gold and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.
20548	35	5	5	5	5	At that moment the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. As the king watched the hand that was writing,
20549	35	5	6	5	6	his face grew pale and his thoughts so alarmed him that his hips gave way and his knees knocked together.
20550	35	5	7	5	7	The king called out for the enchanters, astrologers, and diviners to be brought in, and he said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and tells me its interpretation will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
20551	35	5	8	5	8	So all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the inscription or interpret it for him.
20552	35	5	9	5	9	Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face grew even more pale, and his nobles were bewildered.
20553	35	5	10	5	10	Hearing the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen entered the banquet hall. “O king, may you live forever!” she said. “Do not let your thoughts terrify you, or your face grow pale.
20554	35	5	11	5	11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your father he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. Your own father, the king,
20555	35	5	12	5	12	did this because Daniel, the one he named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, as well as knowledge, understanding, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Summon Daniel, therefore, and he will give you the interpretation.”
20556	35	5	13	5	13	So Daniel was brought before the king, who asked him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?
20557	35	5	14	5	14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom.
20558	35	5	15	5	15	Now the wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this inscription and interpret it for me, but they could not give its interpretation.
20559	35	5	16	5	16	But I have heard about you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
20560	35	5	17	5	17	In response, Daniel said to the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king and interpret it for him.
20561	35	5	18	5	18	As for you, O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness, glory and honor.
20562	35	5	19	5	19	Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him, the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him. He killed whom he wished and kept alive whom he wished; he exalted whom he wished and humbled whom he wished.
20563	35	5	20	5	20	But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit was hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken from him.
20564	35	5	21	5	21	He was driven away from mankind, and his mind was like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God is ruler over the kingdom of mankind, and He sets over it whom He wishes.
20565	35	5	22	5	22	But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this.
20566	35	5	23	5	23	Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels from His house were brought to you, and as you drank wine from them with your nobles, wives, and concubines, you praised your gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you have failed to glorify the God who holds in His hand your very breath and all your ways.
20567	35	5	24	5	24	Therefore He sent the hand that wrote the inscription.
20568	35	5	25	5	25	Now this is the inscription that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.
20569	35	5	26	5	26	And this is the interpretation of the message: MENE means that God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.
20570	35	5	27	5	27	TEKEL means that you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.
20571	35	5	28	5	28	PERES means that your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.”
20572	35	5	29	5	29	Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck, and proclaimed him the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
20573	35	5	30	5	30	That very night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was slain,
20574	35	6	1	5	31	and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.
20575	35	6	2	6	1	Now it pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom,
20576	35	6	3	6	2	and over them three administrators, including Daniel, to whom these satraps were accountable so that the king would not suffer loss.
20577	35	6	4	6	3	Soon, by his extraordinary spirit, Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps. So the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
20578	35	6	5	6	4	Thus the administrators and satraps sought a charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no charge or corruption, because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him.
20579	35	6	6	6	5	Finally these men said, “We will never find any charge against this Daniel, unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.”
20580	35	6	7	6	6	So the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said, “O King Darius, may you live forever!
20581	35	6	8	6	7	All the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce a decree that for thirty days anyone who petitions any god or man except you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions.
20582	35	6	9	6	8	Therefore, O king, establish the decree and sign the document so that it cannot be changed—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”
20583	35	6	10	6	9	Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.
20584	35	6	11	6	10	Now when Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house, where the windows of his upper room opened toward Jerusalem, and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God, just as he had done before.
20585	35	6	12	6	11	Then these men went as a group and found Daniel petitioning and imploring his God.
20586	35	6	13	6	12	So they approached the king and asked about his royal decree: “Did you not sign a decree that for thirty days any man who petitions any god or man except you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?” The king replied, “According to the law of the Medes and Persians the order stands, and it cannot be repealed.”
20587	35	6	14	6	13	Then they told the king, “Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, shows no regard for you, O king, or for the decree that you have signed. He still makes his petition three times a day.”
20588	35	6	15	6	14	As soon as the king heard this, he was deeply distressed and set his mind on delivering Daniel, and he labored until sundown to rescue him.
20589	35	6	16	6	15	Then the men approached the king together and said to him, “Remember, O king, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or ordinance established by the king can be changed.”
20590	35	6	17	6	16	So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”
20591	35	6	18	6	17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that nothing concerning Daniel could be changed.
20592	35	6	19	6	18	Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting. No entertainment was brought before him, and sleep fled from him.
20593	35	6	20	6	19	At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the den of lions.
20594	35	6	21	6	20	When he reached the den, he cried out in a voice of anguish, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”
20595	35	6	22	6	21	Then Daniel replied, “O king, may you live forever!
20596	35	6	23	6	22	My God sent His angel and shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, for I was found innocent in His sight, and I have done no wrong against you, O king.”
20597	35	6	24	6	23	The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den, and when Daniel was lifted out of the den, no wounds whatsoever were found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
20598	35	6	25	6	24	At the command of the king, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the den of lions—they and their children and wives. And before they had reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.
20599	35	6	26	6	25	Then King Darius wrote to the people of every nation and language throughout the land: “May your prosperity abound.
20600	35	6	27	6	26	I hereby decree that in every part of my kingdom, men are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel: For He is the living God, and He endures forever; His kingdom will never be destroyed, and His dominion will never end.
20601	35	6	28	6	27	He delivers and rescues; He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”
20602	35	6	29	6	28	So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
20603	35	7	1	7	1	In the first year of the reign of Belshazzar over Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he lay on his bed. He wrote down the dream, and this is the summary of his account.
20604	35	7	2	7	2	Daniel declared: “In my vision in the night I looked, and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up the great sea.
20605	35	7	3	7	3	Then four great beasts came up out of the sea, each one different from the others:
20606	35	7	4	7	4	The first beast was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and given the mind of a man.
20607	35	7	5	7	5	Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’
20608	35	7	6	7	6	Next, as I watched, another beast appeared. It was like a leopard, and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.
20609	35	7	7	7	7	After this, as I watched in my vision in the night, suddenly a fourth beast appeared, and it was terrifying—dreadful and extremely strong—with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed; then it trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had ten horns.
20610	35	7	8	7	8	While I was contemplating the horns, suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like those of a man and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance.
20611	35	7	9	7	9	As I continued to watch, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.
20612	35	7	10	7	10	A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His presence. Thousands upon thousands attended Him, and myriads upon myriads stood before Him. The court was convened, and the books were opened.
20613	35	7	11	7	11	Then I kept watching because of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued to watch, the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
20614	35	7	12	7	12	As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but they were granted an extension of life for a season and a time.
20615	35	7	13	7	13	In my vision in the night I continued to watch, and I saw One like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence.
20616	35	7	14	7	14	And He was given dominion, glory, and kingship, that the people of every nation and language should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
20617	35	7	15	7	15	I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit, and the visions in my mind alarmed me.
20618	35	7	16	7	16	I approached one of those who were standing there, and I asked him the true meaning of all this. So he told me the interpretation of these things:
20619	35	7	17	7	17	‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from the earth.
20620	35	7	18	7	18	But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.’
20621	35	7	19	7	19	Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others—extremely terrifying—devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws, then trampling underfoot whatever was left.
20622	35	7	20	7	20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others, with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words of arrogance.
20623	35	7	21	7	21	As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and prevailing against them,
20624	35	7	22	7	22	until the Ancient of Days arrived and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for them to possess the kingdom.
20625	35	7	23	7	23	This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.
20626	35	7	24	7	24	And the ten horns are ten kings who will rise from this kingdom. After them another king, different from the earlier ones, will rise and subdue three kings.
20627	35	7	25	7	25	He will speak out against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High, intending to change the appointed times and laws; and the saints will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time.
20628	35	7	26	7	26	But the court will convene, and his dominion will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.
20629	35	7	27	7	27	Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’
20630	35	7	28	7	28	Thus ends the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. But I kept the matter to myself.”
20631	35	8	1	8	1	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one that had appeared to me earlier.
20632	35	8	2	8	2	And in the vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa, in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal.
20633	35	8	3	8	3	Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a ram with two horns standing beside the canal. The horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew up later.
20634	35	8	4	8	4	I saw the ram charging toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and there was no deliverance from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.
20635	35	8	5	8	5	As I was contemplating all this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came out of the west, crossing the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground.
20636	35	8	6	8	6	He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with furious power.
20637	35	8	7	8	7	I saw him approach the ram in a rage against him, and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him, and the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and no one could deliver the ram from his power.
20638	35	8	8	8	8	Thus the goat became very great, but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven.
20639	35	8	9	8	9	From one of these horns a little horn emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the Beautiful Land.
20640	35	8	10	8	10	It grew as high as the host of heaven, and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the earth, and trampled them.
20641	35	8	11	8	11	It magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host; it removed His daily sacrifice and overthrew the place of His sanctuary.
20642	35	8	12	8	12	And in the rebellion, the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to the horn, and it flung truth to the ground and prospered in whatever it did.
20643	35	8	13	8	13	Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, “How long until the fulfillment of the vision of the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host to be trampled?”
20644	35	8	14	8	14	He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be properly restored.”
20645	35	8	15	8	15	While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.
20646	35	8	16	8	16	And I heard the voice of a man calling from between the banks of the Ulai: “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”
20647	35	8	17	8	17	As he came near to where I stood, I was terrified and fell facedown. “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.”
20648	35	8	18	8	18	While he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me, helped me to my feet,
20649	35	8	19	8	19	and said, “Behold, I will make known to you what will happen in the latter time of wrath, because it concerns the appointed time of the end.
20650	35	8	20	8	20	The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia.
20651	35	8	21	8	21	The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king.
20652	35	8	22	8	22	The four horns that replaced the broken one represent four kingdoms that will rise from that nation, but will not have the same power.
20653	35	8	23	8	23	In the latter part of their reign, when the rebellion has reached its full measure, an insolent king, skilled in intrigue, will come to the throne.
20654	35	8	24	8	24	His power will be great, but it will not be his own. He will cause terrible destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men along with the holy people.
20655	35	8	25	8	25	Through his craft and by his hand, he will cause deceit to prosper, and in his own mind he will make himself great. In a time of peace he will destroy many, and he will even stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands.
20656	35	8	26	8	26	The vision of the evenings and the mornings that has been spoken is true. Now you must seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.”
20657	35	8	27	8	27	I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was confounded by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
20658	35	9	1	9	1	In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes, a Mede by descent, who was made ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans—
20659	35	9	2	9	2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the sacred books, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.
20660	35	9	3	9	3	So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
20661	35	9	4	9	4	And I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed, “O, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of loving devotion to those who love Him and keep His commandments,
20662	35	9	5	9	5	we have sinned and done wrong. We have acted wickedly and rebelled. We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances.
20663	35	9	6	9	6	We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, and fathers, and to all the people of the land.
20664	35	9	7	9	7	To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but this day we are covered with shame—the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and all Israel near and far, in all the countries to which You have driven us because of our unfaithfulness to You.
20665	35	9	8	9	8	O LORD, we are covered with shame—our kings, our leaders, and our fathers—because we have sinned against You.
20666	35	9	9	9	9	To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, even though we have rebelled against Him
20667	35	9	10	9	10	and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God to walk in His laws, which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
20668	35	9	11	9	11	All Israel has transgressed Your law and turned away, refusing to obey Your voice; so the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us because we have sinned against You.
20669	35	9	12	9	12	You have carried out the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us a great disaster. For under all of heaven, nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
20670	35	9	13	9	13	Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and giving attention to Your truth.
20671	35	9	14	9	14	Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it upon us. For the LORD our God is righteous in all He does; yet we have not obeyed His voice.
20672	35	9	15	9	15	Now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and who made for Yourself a name renowned to this day, we have sinned; we have acted wickedly.
20673	35	9	16	9	16	O Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, I pray that Your anger and wrath may turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all around us.
20674	35	9	17	9	17	So now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant. For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.
20675	35	9	18	9	18	Incline Your ear, O my God, and hear; open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts, but because of Your great compassion.
20676	35	9	19	9	19	O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For Your sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people bear Your name.”
20677	35	9	20	9	20	While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and that of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before the LORD my God concerning His holy mountain—
20678	35	9	21	9	21	while I was still praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
20679	35	9	22	9	22	He instructed me and spoke with me, saying: “O Daniel, I have come now to give you insight and understanding.
20680	35	9	23	9	23	At the beginning of your petitions, an answer went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly precious. So consider the message and understand the vision:
20681	35	9	24	9	24	Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city to stop their transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.
20682	35	9	25	9	25	Know and understand this: From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until the Messiah, the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of distress.
20683	35	9	26	9	26	Then after the sixty-two weeks, the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed.
20684	35	9	27	9	27	And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation, until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him.”
20685	35	10	1	10	1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, and it concerned a great conflict. And the understanding of the message was given to him in a vision.
20686	35	10	2	10	2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
20687	35	10	3	10	3	I ate no rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not anoint myself with oil until the three weeks were completed.
20688	35	10	4	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,
20689	35	10	5	10	5	I lifted up my eyes, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
20690	35	10	6	10	6	His body was like beryl, his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.
20691	35	10	7	10	7	Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but a great terror fell upon them, and they ran and hid themselves.
20692	35	10	8	10	8	So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision. No strength remained in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless.
20693	35	10	9	10	9	I heard the sound of his words, and as I listened, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
20694	35	10	10	10	10	Suddenly, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
20695	35	10	11	10	11	He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man who is highly precious. Consider carefully the words that I am about to say to you. Stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” And when he had said this to me, I stood up trembling.
20696	35	10	12	10	12	“Do not be afraid, Daniel,” he said, “for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.
20697	35	10	13	10	13	However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
20698	35	10	14	10	14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision concerns those days.”
20699	35	10	15	10	15	While he was speaking these words to me, I set my face toward the ground and became speechless.
20700	35	10	16	10	16	And suddenly one with the likeness of a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and said to the one standing before me, “My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength.
20701	35	10	17	10	17	How can I, your servant, speak with you, my lord? Now I have no strength, nor is any breath left in me.”
20702	35	10	18	10	18	Again the one with the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me.
20703	35	10	19	10	19	“Do not be afraid, you who are highly precious,” he said. “Peace be with you! Be strong now, be very strong!” As he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.”
20704	35	10	20	10	20	“Do you know why I have come to you?” he said. “I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Greece will come.
20705	35	10	21	10	21	But first I will tell you what is inscribed in the Book of Truth. Yet no one has the courage to support me against these, except Michael your prince.”
20706	35	11	1	11	1	“And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, stood up to strengthen and protect him.
20707	35	11	2	11	2	Now then, I will tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. By the power of his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
20708	35	11	3	11	3	Then a mighty king will arise, who will rule with great authority and do as he pleases.
20709	35	11	4	11	4	But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the authority with which he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others.
20710	35	11	5	11	5	The king of the South will grow strong, but one of his commanders will grow even stronger and will rule his own kingdom with great authority.
20711	35	11	6	11	6	After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement. But his daughter will not retain her position of power, nor will his strength endure. At that time she will be given up, along with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her.
20712	35	11	7	11	7	But one from her family line will rise up in his place, come against the army of the king of the North, and enter his fortress, fighting and prevailing.
20713	35	11	8	11	8	He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold. For some years he will stay away from the king of the North,
20714	35	11	9	11	9	who will invade the realm of the king of the South and then return to his own land.
20715	35	11	10	11	10	But his sons will stir up strife and assemble a great army, which will advance forcefully, sweeping through like a flood, and will again carry the battle as far as his fortress.
20716	35	11	11	11	11	In a rage, the king of the South will march out to fight the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be delivered into the hand of his enemy.
20717	35	11	12	11	12	When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be proud in heart and will cast down tens of thousands, but he will not triumph.
20718	35	11	13	11	13	For the king of the North will raise another army, larger than the first, and after some years he will advance with a great army and many supplies.
20719	35	11	14	11	14	In those times many will rise up against the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will exalt themselves in fulfillment of the vision, but they will fail.
20720	35	11	15	11	15	Then the king of the North will come, build up a siege mound, and capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will not stand; even their best troops will not be able to resist.
20721	35	11	16	11	16	The invader will do as he pleases, and no one will stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand.
20722	35	11	17	11	17	He will resolve to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and will reach an agreement with the king of the South. He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plan will not succeed or help him.
20723	35	11	18	11	18	Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many of them. But a commander will put an end to his reproach and will turn it back upon him.
20724	35	11	19	11	19	After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be no more.
20725	35	11	20	11	20	In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be destroyed, though not in anger or in battle.
20726	35	11	21	11	21	In his place a despicable person will arise; royal honors will not be given to him, but he will come in a time of peace and seize the kingdom by intrigue.
20727	35	11	22	11	22	Then a flood of forces will be swept away before him and destroyed, along with a prince of the covenant.
20728	35	11	23	11	23	After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully; for he will rise to power with only a few people.
20729	35	11	24	11	24	In a time of peace, he will invade the richest provinces and do what his fathers and forefathers never did. He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers, and he will plot against the strongholds—but only for a time.
20730	35	11	25	11	25	And with a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South, who will mobilize a very large and powerful army but will not withstand the plots devised against him.
20731	35	11	26	11	26	Those who eat from his provisions will seek to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall slain.
20732	35	11	27	11	27	And the two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will speak lies at the same table, but to no avail, for still the end will come at the appointed time.
20733	35	11	28	11	28	The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant; so he will do damage and return to his own land.
20734	35	11	29	11	29	At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time will not be like the first.
20735	35	11	30	11	30	Ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and rage against the holy covenant and do damage. So he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
20736	35	11	31	11	31	His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination of desolation.
20737	35	11	32	11	32	With flattery he will corrupt those who violate the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.
20738	35	11	33	11	33	Those with insight will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by sword or flame, or be captured or plundered.
20739	35	11	34	11	34	Now when they fall, they will be granted a little help, but many will join them insincerely.
20740	35	11	35	11	35	Some of the wise will fall, so that they may be refined, purified, and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.
20741	35	11	36	11	36	Then the king will do as he pleases and will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been decreed must be accomplished.
20742	35	11	37	11	37	He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers, nor for the one desired by women, nor for any other god, because he will magnify himself above them all.
20743	35	11	38	11	38	And in their place, he will honor a god of fortresses—a god his fathers did not know—with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches.
20744	35	11	39	11	39	He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing the land for a price.
20745	35	11	40	11	40	At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships, invading many countries and sweeping through them like a flood.
20746	35	11	41	11	41	He will also invade the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall. But these will be delivered from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the leaders of the Ammonites.
20747	35	11	42	11	42	He will extend his power over many countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape.
20748	35	11	43	11	43	He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt, and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him.
20749	35	11	44	11	44	But news from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will go out with great fury to destroy many and devote them to destruction.
20750	35	11	45	11	45	He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain, but he will meet his end with no one to help him.”
20751	35	12	1	12	1	“At that time Michael, the great prince who stands watch over your people, will rise up. There will be a time of distress, the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered.
20752	35	12	2	12	2	And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt.
20753	35	12	3	12	3	Then the wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever.
20754	35	12	4	12	4	But you, Daniel, shut up these words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will roam to and fro, and knowledge will increase.”
20755	35	12	5	12	5	Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing there, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank.
20756	35	12	6	12	6	One of them said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long until the fulfillment of these wonders?”
20757	35	12	7	12	7	And the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by Him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, and times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has finally been shattered, all these things will be completed.”
20758	35	12	8	12	8	I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?”
20759	35	12	9	12	9	“Go on your way, Daniel,” he replied, “for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
20760	35	12	10	12	10	Many will be purified, made spotless, and refined, but the wicked will continue to act wickedly. None of the wicked will understand, but the wise will understand.
20761	35	12	11	12	11	And from the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation set up, there will be 1,290 days.
20762	35	12	12	12	12	Blessed is he who waits and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.
20763	35	12	13	12	13	But as for you, go on your way until the end. You will rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days.”
20764	36	1	1	1	1	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows:
20765	36	1	2	1	2	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah.
20766	36	1	3	1	3	Whoever among you belongs to His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem.
20767	36	1	4	1	4	And let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem.’”
20768	36	1	5	1	5	So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone whose spirit God had stirred—prepared to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
20769	36	1	6	1	6	And all their neighbors supported them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuables, in addition to all their freewill offerings.
20770	36	1	7	1	7	King Cyrus also brought out the articles belonging to the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the temple of his gods.
20771	36	1	8	1	8	Cyrus king of Persia had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
20772	36	1	9	1	9	This was the inventory: 30 gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes, 29 silver utensils,
20773	36	1	10	1	10	30 gold bowls, 410 matching silver bowls, and 1,000 other articles.
20774	36	1	11	1	11	In all, there were 5,400 gold and silver articles. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
20775	36	2	1	2	1	Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar its king. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,
20776	36	2	2	2	2	accompanied by Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. This is the count of the men of Israel:

20814	36	2	40	2	40	The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua and Kadmiel (through the line of Hodaviah), 74.
20815	36	2	41	2	41	The singers: the descendants of Asaph, 128.
20816	36	2	42	2	42	The descendants of the gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, the descendants of Ater, the descendants of Talmon, the descendants of Akkub, the descendants of Hatita, and the descendants of Shobai, 139 in all.
20817	36	2	43	2	43	The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, the descendants of Hasupha, the descendants of Tabbaoth,
20818	36	2	44	2	44	the descendants of Keros, the descendants of Siaha, the descendants of Padon,
20819	36	2	45	2	45	the descendants of Lebanah, the descendants of Hagabah, the descendants of Akkub,
20820	36	2	46	2	46	the descendants of Hagab, the descendants of Shalmai, the descendants of Hanan,
20821	36	2	47	2	47	the descendants of Giddel, the descendants of Gahar, the descendants of Reaiah,
20822	36	2	48	2	48	the descendants of Rezin, the descendants of Nekoda, the descendants of Gazzam,
20823	36	2	49	2	49	the descendants of Uzza, the descendants of Paseah, the descendants of Besai,
20824	36	2	50	2	50	the descendants of Asnah, the descendants of Meunim, the descendants of Nephusim,
20825	36	2	51	2	51	the descendants of Bakbuk, the descendants of Hakupha, the descendants of Harhur,
20826	36	2	52	2	52	the descendants of Bazluth, the descendants of Mehida, the descendants of Harsha,
20827	36	2	53	2	53	the descendants of Barkos, the descendants of Sisera, the descendants of Tamah,
20828	36	2	54	2	54	the descendants of Neziah, and the descendants of Hatipha.
20829	36	2	55	2	55	The descendants of the servants of Solomon: the descendants of Sotai, the descendants of Sophereth, the descendants of Peruda,
20830	36	2	56	2	56	the descendants of Jaala, the descendants of Darkon, the descendants of Giddel,
20831	36	2	57	2	57	the descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth-hazzebaim, and the descendants of Ami.
20832	36	2	58	2	58	The temple servants and descendants of the servants of Solomon numbered 392 in all.
20833	36	2	59	2	59	The following came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but could not prove that their families were descended from Israel:
20834	36	2	60	2	60	the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda, 652 in all.
20835	36	2	61	2	61	And from among the priests: the descendants of Habaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai (who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).
20836	36	2	62	2	62	These men searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
20837	36	2	63	2	63	The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.
20838	36	2	64	2	64	The whole assembly numbered 42,360,
20839	36	2	65	2	65	in addition to their 7,337 menservants and maidservants, as well as their 200 male and female singers.
20840	36	2	66	2	66	They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
20841	36	2	67	2	67	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
20842	36	2	68	2	68	When they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings to rebuild the house of God on its original site.
20843	36	2	69	2	69	According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 darics of gold, 5,000 minas of silver, and 100 priestly garments.
20844	36	2	70	2	70	So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, along with some of the people, settled in their own towns; and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
20845	36	3	1	3	1	By the seventh month, the Israelites had settled in their towns, and the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.
20846	36	3	2	3	2	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests, along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates, began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
20847	36	3	3	3	3	They set up the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD—both the morning and evening burnt offerings—even though they feared the people of the land.
20848	36	3	4	3	4	They also celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles in accordance with what is written, and they offered burnt offerings daily based on the number prescribed for each day.
20849	36	3	5	3	5	After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings and those for New Moons and for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as all the freewill offerings brought to the LORD.
20850	36	3	6	3	6	On the first day of the seventh month, the Israelites began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, although the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid.
20851	36	3	7	3	7	They gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to Joppa by sea, as authorized by King Cyrus of Persia.
20852	36	3	8	3	8	In the second month of the second year after they had arrived at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their associates including the priests, the Levites, and all who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity, began the work. They appointed Levites twenty years of age or older to supervise the construction of the house of the LORD.
20853	36	3	9	3	9	So Jeshua and his sons and brothers, Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Yehudah), and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers—all Levites—joined together to supervise those working on the house of God.
20854	36	3	10	3	10	When the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their positions to praise the LORD, as David king of Israel had prescribed.
20855	36	3	11	3	11	And they sang responsively with praise and thanksgiving to the LORD: “For He is good; for His loving devotion to Israel endures forever.” Then all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD had been laid.
20856	36	3	12	3	12	But many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads who had seen the first temple wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this temple. Still, many others shouted joyfully.
20857	36	3	13	3	13	The people could not distinguish the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people were making so much noise. And the sound was heard from afar.
20858	36	4	1	4	1	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,
20859	36	4	2	4	2	they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families, saying, “Let us build with you because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of King Esar-haddon of Assyria, who brought us here.”
20860	36	4	3	4	3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of the families of Israel replied, “You have no part with us in building a house for our God, since we alone must build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”
20861	36	4	4	4	4	Then the people of the land set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to build.
20862	36	4	5	4	5	They hired counselors against them to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
20863	36	4	6	4	6	At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, an accusation was lodged against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
20864	36	4	7	4	7	And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. It was written in Aramaic and then translated.
20865	36	4	8	4	8	Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote the letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
20866	36	4	9	4	9	From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges and officials over Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,
20867	36	4	10	4	10	and the rest of the peoples whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and elsewhere west of the Euphrates.
20868	36	4	11	4	11	(This is the text of the letter they sent to him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men west of the Euphrates:
20869	36	4	12	4	12	Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came from you to us have returned to Jerusalem. And they are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city, restoring its walls, and repairing its foundations.
20870	36	4	13	4	13	Let it now be known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, they will not pay tribute, duty, or toll, and the royal treasury will suffer.
20871	36	4	14	4	14	Now because we are in the service of the palace and it is not fitting for us to allow the king to be dishonored, we have sent to inform the king
20872	36	4	15	4	15	that a search should be made of the record books of your fathers. In these books you will discover and verify that the city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, inciting sedition from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
20873	36	4	16	4	16	We advise the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, you will have no dominion west of the Euphrates.
20874	36	4	17	4	17	Then the king sent this reply: To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of your associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates: Greetings.
20875	36	4	18	4	18	The letter you sent us has been translated and read in my presence.
20876	36	4	19	4	19	I issued a decree, and a search was conducted. It was discovered that this city has revolted against kings from ancient times, engaging in rebellion and sedition.
20877	36	4	20	4	20	And mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over the whole region west of the Euphrates; and tribute, duty, and toll were paid to them.
20878	36	4	21	4	21	Now, therefore, issue an order for these men to stop, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.
20879	36	4	22	4	22	See that you do not neglect this matter. Why allow this threat to increase and the royal interests to suffer?
20880	36	4	23	4	23	When the text of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and forcibly stopped them.
20881	36	4	24	4	24	Thus the construction of the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
20882	36	5	1	5	1	Later, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
20883	36	5	2	5	2	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up and began to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
20884	36	5	3	5	3	At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates went to the Jews and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
20885	36	5	4	5	4	They also asked, “What are the names of the men who are constructing this building?”
20886	36	5	5	5	5	But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, so that they were not stopped until a report was sent to Darius and written instructions about this matter were returned.
20887	36	5	6	5	6	This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius.
20888	36	5	7	5	7	The report they sent him read as follows: To King Darius: All peace.
20889	36	5	8	5	8	Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. The people are rebuilding it with large stones, and placing timbers in the walls. This work is being carried out diligently and is prospering in their hands.
20890	36	5	9	5	9	So we questioned the elders and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
20891	36	5	10	5	10	We also asked for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
20892	36	5	11	5	11	And this is the answer they returned: “We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed.
20893	36	5	12	5	12	But since our fathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this temple and carried away the people to Babylon.
20894	36	5	13	5	13	However, in his first year, Cyrus king of Babylon issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
20895	36	5	14	5	14	He also removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken and carried there from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus gave these articles to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor
20896	36	5	15	5	15	and instructed, ‘Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.’
20897	36	5	16	5	16	So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been under construction, but it has not yet been completed.”
20898	36	5	17	5	17	Now, therefore, if it pleases the king, let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon to see if King Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
20899	36	6	1	6	1	Thus King Darius ordered a search of the archives stored in the treasury of Babylon.
20900	36	6	2	6	2	And a scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana, in the province of Media, with the following written on it: Memorandum:
20901	36	6	3	6	3	In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. It is to be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide,
20902	36	6	4	6	4	with three layers of cut stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid from the royal treasury.
20903	36	6	5	6	5	Furthermore, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, must also be returned to the temple in Jerusalem and deposited in the house of God.
20904	36	6	6	6	6	Therefore Darius decreed: To Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates and officials in the region: You must stay away from that place!
20905	36	6	7	6	7	Leave this work on the house of God alone. Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site.
20906	36	6	8	6	8	I hereby decree what you must do for these elders of the Jews who are rebuilding this house of God: The cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces west of the Euphrates, so that the work will not be hindered.
20907	36	6	9	6	9	Whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be given to them daily without fail.
20908	36	6	10	6	10	Then they will be able to offer sacrifices of a sweet aroma to the God of heaven and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons.
20909	36	6	11	6	11	I also decree that if any man interferes with this directive, a beam is to be torn from his house and raised up, and he is to be impaled on it. And his own house shall be made a pile of rubble for this offense.
20910	36	6	12	6	12	May God, who has caused His Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to alter this decree or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree. Let it be carried out with diligence.
20911	36	6	13	6	13	In response, Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates diligently carried out what King Darius had decreed.
20912	36	6	14	6	14	So the Jewish elders built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
20913	36	6	15	6	15	And this temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
20914	36	6	16	6	16	Then the people of Israel—the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
20915	36	6	17	6	17	For the dedication of the house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and a sin offering for all Israel of twelve male goats, one for each tribe of Israel.
20916	36	6	18	6	18	They also appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their groups to the service of God in Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
20917	36	6	19	6	19	On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles kept the Passover.
20918	36	6	20	6	20	All the priests and Levites had purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. And the Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their priestly brothers, and for themselves.
20919	36	6	21	6	21	The Israelites who had returned from exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land, in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.
20920	36	6	22	6	22	For seven days they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel.
20921	36	7	1	7	1	Many years later, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
20922	36	7	2	7	2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
20923	36	7	3	7	3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
20924	36	7	4	7	4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
20925	36	7	5	7	5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest—
20926	36	7	6	7	6	this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted Ezra all his requests, for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.
20927	36	7	7	7	7	So in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, he went up to Jerusalem with some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants.
20928	36	7	8	7	8	Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
20929	36	7	9	7	9	He had begun the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was upon him.
20930	36	7	10	7	10	For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, to practice it, and to teach its statutes and ordinances in Israel.
20931	36	7	11	7	11	This is the text of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and scribe, a man learned in the commandments and statutes of the LORD to Israel:
20932	36	7	12	7	12	Artaxerxes, king of kings. To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Greetings.
20933	36	7	13	7	13	I hereby decree that any volunteers among the Israelites in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites, may go up with you to Jerusalem.
20934	36	7	14	7	14	You are sent by the king and his seven counselors to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
20935	36	7	15	7	15	Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
20936	36	7	16	7	16	together with all the silver and gold you may find in all the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests to the house of their God in Jerusalem.
20937	36	7	17	7	17	With this money, therefore, you are to buy as many bulls, rams, and lambs as needed, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar at the house of your God in Jerusalem.
20938	36	7	18	7	18	You and your brothers may do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God.
20939	36	7	19	7	19	You must deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles given to you for the service of the house of your God.
20940	36	7	20	7	20	And if anything else is needed for the house of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may pay for it from the royal treasury.
20941	36	7	21	7	21	I, King Artaxerxes, decree to all the treasurers west of the Euphrates: Whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it must be provided promptly,
20942	36	7	22	7	22	up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.
20943	36	7	23	7	23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done diligently for His house. For why should wrath fall on the realm of the king and his sons?
20944	36	7	24	7	24	And be advised that you have no authority to impose tribute, duty, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
20945	36	7	25	7	25	And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which you possess, are to appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people west of the Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach these laws to anyone who does not know them.
20946	36	7	26	7	26	If anyone does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, let a strict judgment be executed against him, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
20947	36	7	27	7	27	Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put into the heart of the king to so honor the house of the LORD in Jerusalem,
20948	36	7	28	7	28	and who has shown me favor before the king, his counselors, and all his powerful officials. And because the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, I took courage and gathered the leaders of Israel to return with me.
20949	36	8	1	8	1	These are the family heads and genealogical records of those who returned with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
20950	36	8	2	8	2	from the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; from the descendants of David, Hattush
20951	36	8	3	8	3	of the descendants of Shecaniah; from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
20952	36	8	4	8	4	from the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
20953	36	8	5	8	5	from the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
20954	36	8	6	8	6	from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
20955	36	8	7	8	7	from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
20956	36	8	8	8	8	from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
20957	36	8	9	8	9	from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
20958	36	8	10	8	10	from the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
20959	36	8	11	8	11	from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
20960	36	8	12	8	12	from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
20961	36	8	13	8	13	from the later descendants of Adonikam, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
20962	36	8	14	8	14	and from the descendants of Bigvai, both Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
20963	36	8	15	8	15	Now I assembled these exiles at the canal that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And when I searched among the people and priests, I found no Levites there.
20964	36	8	16	8	16	Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan.
20965	36	8	17	8	17	And I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for him and his kinsmen, the temple servants at Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
20966	36	8	18	8	18	And since the gracious hand of our God was upon us, they brought us Sherebiah—a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel—along with his sons and brothers, 18 men;
20967	36	8	19	8	19	also Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20 men.
20968	36	8	20	8	20	They also brought 220 of the temple servants, all designated by name. David and the officials had appointed them to assist the Levites.
20969	36	8	21	8	21	And there by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
20970	36	8	22	8	22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for an escort of soldiers and horsemen to protect us from our enemies on the road, since we had told him, “The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek Him, but His great anger is against all who forsake Him.”
20971	36	8	23	8	23	So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and He granted our request.
20972	36	8	24	8	24	Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers,
20973	36	8	25	8	25	and I weighed out to them the contribution of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites there had offered for the house of our God.
20974	36	8	26	8	26	I weighed out into their hands 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
20975	36	8	27	8	27	20 gold bowls valued at 1,000 darics, and two articles of fine polished bronze, as precious as gold.
20976	36	8	28	8	28	Then I told them, “You are holy to the LORD, and these articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
20977	36	8	29	8	29	Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the Israelite families.”
20978	36	8	30	8	30	So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
20979	36	8	31	8	31	On the twelfth day of the first month, we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our God was upon us to protect us from the hands of the enemies and bandits along the way.
20980	36	8	32	8	32	So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
20981	36	8	33	8	33	On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and sacred articles into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, along with the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
20982	36	8	34	8	34	Everything was verified by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
20983	36	8	35	8	35	Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and a sin offering of 12 male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
20984	36	8	36	8	36	They also delivered the king’s edicts to the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates, who proceeded to assist the people and the house of God.
20985	36	9	1	9	1	After these things had been accomplished, the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples whose abominations are like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
20986	36	9	2	9	2	Indeed, the Israelites have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed has been mixed with the people of the land. And the leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!”
20987	36	9	3	9	3	When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled out some hair from my head and beard, and sat down in horror.
20988	36	9	4	9	4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat there in horror until the evening offering.
20989	36	9	5	9	5	At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation with my tunic and cloak torn, and I fell on my knees, spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
20990	36	9	6	9	6	and said: “O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, because our iniquities are higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens.
20991	36	9	7	9	7	From the days of our fathers to this day, our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities, we and our kings and priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the earth and put to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation, as we are this day.
20992	36	9	8	9	8	But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from the LORD our God to preserve for us a remnant and to give us a stake in His holy place. Even in our bondage, our God has given us new life and light to our eyes.
20993	36	9	9	9	9	Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but He has extended to us grace in the sight of the kings of Persia, giving us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
20994	36	9	10	9	10	And now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commandments
20995	36	9	11	9	11	that You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples and the abominations with which they have filled it from end to end.
20996	36	9	12	9	12	Now, therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you may be strong and may eat the good things of the land, leaving it as an inheritance to your sons forever.’
20997	36	9	13	9	13	After all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt (though You, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant as this),
20998	36	9	14	9	14	shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not become so angry with us as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or survivor?
20999	36	9	15	9	15	O LORD, God of Israel, You are righteous! For we remain this day as a remnant. Here we are before You in our guilt, though because of it no one can stand before You.”
21000	36	10	1	10	1	While Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and falling facedown before the house of God, a very large assembly of Israelites—men, women, and children—gathered around him, and the people wept bitterly as well.
21001	36	10	2	10	2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, an Elamite, said to Ezra: “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the people of the land, yet in spite of this, there is hope for Israel.
21002	36	10	3	10	3	So now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all the foreign wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the command of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
21003	36	10	4	10	4	Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we will support you. Be strong and take action!”
21004	36	10	5	10	5	So Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said. And they took the oath.
21005	36	10	6	10	6	Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. And while he stayed there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
21006	36	10	7	10	7	And a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem.
21007	36	10	8	10	8	Whoever failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, according to the counsel of the leaders and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
21008	36	10	9	10	9	So within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem, and on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square at the house of God, trembling regarding this matter and because of the heavy rain.
21009	36	10	10	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel.
21010	36	10	11	10	11	Now, therefore, make a confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from your foreign wives.”
21011	36	10	12	10	12	And the whole assembly responded in a loud voice: “Truly we must do as you say!
21012	36	10	13	10	13	But there are many people here, and it is the rainy season. We are not able to stay out in the open. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter.
21013	36	10	14	10	14	Let our leaders represent the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at an appointed time, together with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”
21014	36	10	15	10	15	(Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this plan.)
21015	36	10	16	10	16	So the exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, each of them identified by name, to represent their families. On the first day of the tenth month they launched the investigation,
21016	36	10	17	10	17	and by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
21017	36	10	18	10	18	Among the descendants of the priests who had married foreign women were found these descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
21018	36	10	19	10	19	They pledged to send their wives away, and for their guilt they presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.

21043	36	10	44	10	44	All these men had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
21044	37	1	1	1	1	These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah: In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,
21045	37	1	2	1	2	Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah. So I questioned them about the remnant of the Jews who had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
21046	37	1	3	1	3	And they told me, “The remnant who survived the exile are there in the province, in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”
21047	37	1	4	1	4	When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
21048	37	1	5	1	5	Then I said: “O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion with those who love Him and keep His commandments,
21049	37	1	6	1	6	let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to hear the prayer that I, Your servant, now pray before You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against You. Both I and my father’s house have sinned.
21050	37	1	7	1	7	We have behaved corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that You gave Your servant Moses.
21051	37	1	8	1	8	Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses when You said, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,
21052	37	1	9	1	9	but if you return to Me to keep and practice My commandments, then even if your exiles have been banished to the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for My Name.’
21053	37	1	10	1	10	They are Your servants and Your people. You redeemed them by Your great power and mighty hand.
21054	37	1	11	1	11	O Lord, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and to the prayers of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” (At that time I was the cupbearer to the king.)
21055	37	2	1	2	1	Now in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence,
21056	37	2	2	2	2	so the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, though you are not ill? This could only be sadness of the heart.” I was overwhelmed with fear
21057	37	2	3	2	3	and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
21058	37	2	4	2	4	“What is your request?” replied the king. So I prayed to the God of heaven
21059	37	2	5	2	5	and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city where my fathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.”
21060	37	2	6	2	6	Then the king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time.
21061	37	2	7	2	7	I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may letters be given to me for the governors west of the Euphrates, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.
21062	37	2	8	2	8	And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I will occupy.” And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.
21063	37	2	9	2	9	Then I went to the governors west of the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
21064	37	2	10	2	10	But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were deeply disturbed that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites.
21065	37	2	11	2	11	After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,
21066	37	2	12	2	12	I set out at night with a few men. I did not tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal with me was the one on which I was riding.
21067	37	2	13	2	13	So I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Well of the Serpent and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been destroyed by fire.
21068	37	2	14	2	14	Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to get through;
21069	37	2	15	2	15	so I went up the valley by night and inspected the wall. Then I headed back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
21070	37	2	16	2	16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews or priests or nobles or officials or any other workers.
21071	37	2	17	2	17	Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned down. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”
21072	37	2	18	2	18	I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me, and what the king had said to me. “Let us start rebuilding,” they replied, and they set their hands to this good work.
21073	37	2	19	2	19	When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they mocked us and ridiculed us, saying, “What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”
21074	37	2	20	2	20	So I answered them and said, “The God of heaven is the One who will grant us success. We, His servants, will start rebuilding, but you have no portion, right, or claim in Jerusalem.”
21075	37	3	1	3	1	At the Sheep Gate, Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began rebuilding. They dedicated it and installed its doors. After building as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel, they dedicated the wall.
21076	37	3	2	3	2	The men of Jericho built next to Eliashib, and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.
21077	37	3	3	3	3	The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
21078	37	3	4	3	4	Next to them, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, made repairs. Next to him, Meshullam son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs; and next to him, Zadok son of Baana made repairs as well.
21079	37	3	5	3	5	Next to him, the Tekoites made repairs, but their nobles did not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors.
21080	37	3	6	3	6	The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
21081	37	3	7	3	7	Next to them, repairs were made by Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who were under the authority of the governor of the region west of the Euphrates.
21082	37	3	8	3	8	Next to them, Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs, and next to him, Hananiah son of the perfumer made repairs. They fortified Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
21083	37	3	9	3	9	Next to them, Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, made repairs;
21084	37	3	10	3	10	next to him, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs across from his house; and next to him, Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs.
21085	37	3	11	3	11	Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab repaired another section, as well as the Tower of the Ovens.
21086	37	3	12	3	12	And next to them, Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, made repairs, with the help of his daughters.
21087	37	3	13	3	13	The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it, installed its doors, bolts, and bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
21088	37	3	14	3	14	The Dung Gate was repaired by Malchijah son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem. He rebuilt it and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.
21089	37	3	15	3	15	The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Col-hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofed it, and installed its doors, bolts, and bars. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king’s garden, as far as the stairs that descend from the City of David.
21090	37	3	16	3	16	Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth-zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Mighty.
21091	37	3	17	3	17	Next to him, the Levites made repairs under Rehum son of Bani, and next to him, Hashabiah, ruler of a half-district of Keilah, made repairs for his district.
21092	37	3	18	3	18	Next to him, their countrymen made repairs under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah.
21093	37	3	19	3	19	And next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section opposite the Ascent to the Armory, near the angle in the wall.
21094	37	3	20	3	20	Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai diligently repaired another section, from the angle to the doorway of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
21095	37	3	21	3	21	Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the doorway of the house of Eliashib to the end of it.
21096	37	3	22	3	22	And next to him, the priests from the surrounding area made repairs.
21097	37	3	23	3	23	Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house, and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house.
21098	37	3	24	3	24	After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the angle and the corner,
21099	37	3	25	3	25	and Palal son of Uzai made repairs opposite the angle and the tower that juts out from the upper palace of the king near the courtyard of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh
21100	37	3	26	3	26	and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the tower that juts out.
21101	37	3	27	3	27	And next to them, the Tekoites repaired another section, from a point opposite the great tower that juts out to the wall of Ophel.
21102	37	3	28	3	28	Above the Horse Gate, each of the priests made repairs in front of his own house.
21103	37	3	29	3	29	Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house, and next to him, Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the guard of the East Gate, made repairs.
21104	37	3	30	3	30	Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, as well as Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his own quarters.
21105	37	3	31	3	31	Next to him, Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the upper room above the corner.
21106	37	3	32	3	32	And between the upper room above the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
21107	37	3	33	4	1	Now when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and was filled with indignation. He ridiculed the Jews
21108	37	3	34	4	2	before his associates and the army of Samaria, saying, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore the wall by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”
21109	37	3	35	4	3	Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!”
21110	37	3	36	4	4	Hear us, O God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn back upon their own heads, and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.
21111	37	3	37	4	5	Do not cover up their iniquity or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight, for they have provoked the builders.
21112	37	3	38	4	6	So we rebuilt the wall until all of it was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
21113	37	4	1	4	7	When Sanballat and Tobiah, together with the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they were furious,
21114	37	4	2	4	8	and all of them conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem and create a hindrance.
21115	37	4	3	4	9	So we prayed to our God and posted a guard against them day and night.
21116	37	4	4	4	10	Meanwhile, the people of Judah said: “The strength of the laborer fails, and there is so much rubble that we will never be able to rebuild the wall.”
21117	37	4	5	4	11	And our enemies said, “Before they know or see a thing, we will come into their midst, kill them, and put an end to the work.”
21118	37	4	6	4	12	At that time the Jews who lived nearby came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
21119	37	4	7	4	13	So I stationed men behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
21120	37	4	8	4	14	After I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
21121	37	4	9	4	15	When our enemies heard that we were aware of their scheme and that God had frustrated it, each of us returned to his own work on the wall.
21122	37	4	10	4	16	And from that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah
21123	37	4	11	4	17	who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried materials worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.
21124	37	4	12	4	18	And each of the builders worked with his sword strapped at his side. But the trumpeter stayed beside me.
21125	37	4	13	4	19	Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “The work is great and extensive, and we are spread out far from one another along the wall.
21126	37	4	14	4	20	Wherever you hear the sound of the horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!”
21127	37	4	15	4	21	So we continued the work, while half of the men held spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
21128	37	4	16	4	22	At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.”
21129	37	4	17	4	23	So neither I nor brothers nor my men nor the guards with me changed out of our clothes; each carried his weapon, even to go for water.
21130	37	5	1	5	1	About that time there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
21131	37	5	2	5	2	Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous. We must get grain in order to eat and stay alive.”
21132	37	5	3	5	3	Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain during the famine.”
21133	37	5	4	5	4	Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.
21134	37	5	5	5	5	We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless to redeem them because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”
21135	37	5	6	5	6	When I heard their outcry and these complaints, I became extremely angry,
21136	37	5	7	5	7	and after serious thought I rebuked the nobles and officials, saying, “You are exacting usury from your own brothers!” So I called a large assembly against them
21137	37	5	8	5	8	and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold to foreigners, but now you are selling your own brothers, that they may be sold back to us!” But they remained silent, for they could find nothing to say.
21138	37	5	9	5	9	So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our foreign enemies?
21139	37	5	10	5	10	I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending the people money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury.
21140	37	5	11	5	11	Please restore to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and olive oil that you have been assessing them.”
21141	37	5	12	5	12	“We will restore it,” they replied, “and will require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.” So I summoned the priests and required of the nobles and officials an oath that they would do what they had promised.
21142	37	5	13	5	13	I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake out of His house and possession every man who does not keep this promise. May such a man be shaken out and have nothing!” The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
21143	37	5	14	5	14	Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from his twentieth year until his thirty-second year (12 years total), neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
21144	37	5	15	5	15	The governors before me had heavily burdened the people, taking from them bread and wine plus forty shekels of silver. Their servants also oppressed the people, but I did not do this because of my fear of God.
21145	37	5	16	5	16	Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall, and all my servants were gathered there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
21146	37	5	17	5	17	There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides the guests from the surrounding nations.
21147	37	5	18	5	18	Each day one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided. But I did not demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy.
21148	37	5	19	5	19	Remember me favorably, O my God, for all that I have done for this people.
21149	37	6	1	6	1	When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left—though to that time I had not yet installed the doors in the gates—
21150	37	6	2	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.” But they were planning to harm me.
21151	37	6	3	6	3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you?”
21152	37	6	4	6	4	Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave the same reply.
21153	37	6	5	6	5	The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this same message by his young servant, who had in his hand an unsealed letter
21154	37	6	6	6	6	that read: “It is reported among the nations—and Geshem agrees—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and this is why you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king,
21155	37	6	7	6	7	and you have even appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: ‘There is a king in Judah.’ Soon these rumors will reach the ears of the king. So come, let us confer together.”
21156	37	6	8	6	8	Then I sent him this reply: “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”
21157	37	6	9	6	9	For they were all trying to frighten us, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will never be finished.” But now, my God, strengthen my hands.
21158	37	6	10	6	10	Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house. He said: “Let us meet at the house of God inside the temple. Let us shut the temple doors because they are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you!”
21159	37	6	11	6	11	But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Should one like me go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go!”
21160	37	6	12	6	12	I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
21161	37	6	13	6	13	He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would sin by doing as he suggested, so they could give me a bad name in order to discredit me.
21162	37	6	14	6	14	O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who tried to intimidate me.
21163	37	6	15	6	15	So the wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.
21164	37	6	16	6	16	When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and disheartened, for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God.
21165	37	6	17	6	17	Also in those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came back to them.
21166	37	6	18	6	18	For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
21167	37	6	19	6	19	Moreover, these nobles kept reporting to me Tobiah’s good deeds, and they relayed my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
21168	37	7	1	7	1	When the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed.
21169	37	7	2	7	2	Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most.
21170	37	7	3	7	3	And I told them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the guards are on duty, keep the doors shut and securely fastened. And appoint the residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their own homes.”
21171	37	7	4	7	4	Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
21172	37	7	5	7	5	Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. I found the genealogical register of those who had first returned, and I found the following written in it:
21173	37	7	6	7	6	These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar its king. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,
21174	37	7	7	7	7	accompanied by Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. This is the count of the men of Israel:

21211	37	7	44	7	44	The singers: the descendants of Asaph, 148.
21212	37	7	45	7	45	The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, the descendants of Ater, the descendants of Talmon, the descendants of Akkub, the descendants of Hatita, and the descendants of Shobai, 138 in all.
21213	37	7	46	7	46	The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, the descendants of Hasupha, the descendants of Tabbaoth,
21214	37	7	47	7	47	the descendants of Keros, the descendants of Sia, the descendants of Padon,
21215	37	7	48	7	48	the descendants of Lebanah, the descendants of Hagabah, the descendants of Shalmai,

21217	37	7	50	7	50	the descendants of Reaiah, the descendants of Rezin, the descendants of Nekoda,
21218	37	7	51	7	51	the descendants of Gazzam, the descendants of Uzza, the descendants of Paseah,
21219	37	7	52	7	52	the descendants of Besai, the descendants of Meunim, the descendants of Nephushesim,
21220	37	7	53	7	53	the descendants of Bakbuk, the descendants of Hakupha, the descendants of Harhur,
21221	37	7	54	7	54	the descendants of Bazlith, the descendants of Mehida, the descendants of Harsha,
21222	37	7	55	7	55	the descendants of Barkos, the descendants of Sisera, the descendants of Temah,
21223	37	7	56	7	56	the descendants of Neziah, the descendants of Hatipha.
21224	37	7	57	7	57	The descendants of the servants of Solomon: the descendants of Sotai, the descendants of Sophereth, the descendants of Perida,
21225	37	7	58	7	58	the descendants of Jaala, the descendants of Darkon, the descendants of Giddel,
21226	37	7	59	7	59	the descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the descendants of Amon.
21227	37	7	60	7	60	The temple servants and descendants of the servants of Solomon numbered 392 in all.
21228	37	7	61	7	61	The following came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but could not prove that their families were descended from Israel:
21229	37	7	62	7	62	the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, and the descendants of Nekoda, 642 in all.
21230	37	7	63	7	63	And from among the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai (who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).
21231	37	7	64	7	64	These men searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
21232	37	7	65	7	65	The governor ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest to consult the Urim and Thummim.
21233	37	7	66	7	66	The whole assembly numbered 42,360,
21234	37	7	67	7	67,68	in addition to their 7,337 menservants and maidservants, as well as their 245 male and female singers. They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
21235	37	7	68	7	69	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
21236	37	7	69	7	70	Some of the heads of the families contributed to the project. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 bowls, and 530 priestly garments.
21237	37	7	70	7	71	And some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury for the project 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
21238	37	7	71	7	72	The rest of the people gave a total of 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priestly garments.
21239	37	7	72	7	73	So the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, and temple servants, along with some of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns. And by the seventh month the Israelites had settled in their towns.
21240	37	8	1	8	1	At that time all the people gathered together in the square before the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel.
21241	37	8	2	8	2	On the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who could listen and understand.
21242	37	8	3	8	3	So Ezra read it aloud from daybreak until noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate, in front of the men and women and those who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
21243	37	8	4	8	4	Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for this occasion. At his right side stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, and at his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
21244	37	8	5	8	5	Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people, since he was standing above them all, and as he opened it, all the people stood up.
21245	37	8	6	8	6	Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and with their hands uplifted, all the people said, “Amen, Amen!” Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
21246	37	8	7	8	7	The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law as they stood in their places.
21247	37	8	8	8	8	So they read from the Book of the Law of God, explaining it and giving insight, so that the people could understand what was being read.
21248	37	8	9	8	9	Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all of them, “This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep.” For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the Law.
21249	37	8	10	8	10	Then Nehemiah told them, “Go and eat what is rich, drink what is sweet, and send out portions to those who have nothing prepared, since today is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”
21250	37	8	11	8	11	And the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, since today is holy. Do not grieve.”
21251	37	8	12	8	12	Then all the people began to eat and drink, to send out portions, and to rejoice greatly, because they understood the words that had been made known to them.
21252	37	8	13	8	13	On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to study the words of the Law.
21253	37	8	14	8	14	And they found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month.
21254	37	8	15	8	15	So they proclaimed this message and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hill country and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.”
21255	37	8	16	8	16	And the people went out, brought back branches, and made booths on their own rooftops, in their courtyards, in the court of the house of God, and in the squares by the Water Gate and by the Gate of Ephraim.
21256	37	8	17	8	17	The whole assembly who had returned from exile made booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated like this. And there was great rejoicing.
21257	37	8	18	8	18	Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. The Israelites kept the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day they held an assembly, according to the ordinance.
21258	37	9	1	9	1	On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth, with dust on their heads.
21259	37	9	2	9	2	Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all the foreigners, and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
21260	37	9	3	9	3	While they stood in their places, they read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and they spent another quarter of the day in confession and worship of the LORD their God.
21261	37	9	4	9	4	And the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani—stood on the raised platform and cried out in a loud voice to the LORD their God.
21262	37	9	5	9	5	Then the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, “Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting: Blessed be Your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
21263	37	9	6	9	6	You alone are the LORD. You created the heavens, the highest heavens with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all things, and the host of heaven worships You.
21264	37	9	7	9	7	You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram, who brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham.
21265	37	9	8	9	8	You found his heart faithful before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites and Hittites, of the Amorites and Perizzites, of the Jebusites and Girgashites—to give it to his descendants. You have kept Your promise, because You are righteous.
21266	37	9	9	9	9	You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt; You heard their cry at the Red Sea.
21267	37	9	10	9	10	You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all his officials, and all the people of his land, for You knew they had acted with arrogance against our fathers. You made a name for Yourself that endures to this day.
21268	37	9	11	9	11	You divided the sea before them, and they crossed through it on dry ground. You hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into raging waters.
21269	37	9	12	9	12	You led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which they should travel.
21270	37	9	13	9	13	You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. You gave them just ordinances, true laws, and good statutes and commandments.
21271	37	9	14	9	14	You revealed to them Your holy Sabbath, and gave them commandments and statutes and laws through Your servant Moses.
21272	37	9	15	9	15	In their hunger You gave them bread from heaven; in their thirst You brought them water from the rock. You told them to go in and possess the land which You had sworn to give them.
21273	37	9	16	9	16	But they and our fathers became arrogant and stiff-necked and did not obey Your commandments.
21274	37	9	17	9	17	They refused to listen and failed to remember the wonders You performed among them. They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader to return them to their bondage in Egypt. But You are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in loving devotion, and You did not forsake them.
21275	37	9	18	9	18	Even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ and when they committed terrible blasphemies,
21276	37	9	19	9	19	You in Your great compassion did not forsake them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud never turned away from guiding them on their path; and by the night the pillar of fire illuminated the way they should go.
21277	37	9	20	9	20	You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water for their thirst.
21278	37	9	21	9	21	For forty years You sustained them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
21279	37	9	22	9	22	You gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner of the land. So they took the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and of Og king of Bashan.
21280	37	9	23	9	23	You multiplied their descendants like the stars of heaven and brought them to the land You had told their fathers to enter and possess.
21281	37	9	24	9	24	So their descendants went in and possessed the land; You subdued before them the Canaanites dwelling in the land. You delivered into their hands the kings and peoples of the land, to do with them as they wished.
21282	37	9	25	9	25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land and took houses full of all goods, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled; they grew fat and delighted in Your great goodness.
21283	37	9	26	9	26	But they were disobedient and rebelled against You; they flung Your law behind their backs. They killed Your prophets who had admonished them to return to You. They committed terrible blasphemies.
21284	37	9	27	9	27	So You delivered them into the hands of enemies who oppressed them, and in their time of distress they cried out to You. From heaven You heard them, and in Your great compassion You gave them deliverers who saved them from the hands of their enemies.
21285	37	9	28	9	28	But as soon as they had rest, they again did evil in Your sight. So You abandoned them to the hands of their enemies, who had dominion over them. When they cried out to You again, You heard from heaven, and You delivered them many times in Your compassion.
21286	37	9	29	9	29	You admonished them to turn back to Your law, but they were arrogant and disobeyed Your commandments. They sinned against Your ordinances, by which a man will live if he practices them. They stubbornly shrugged their shoulders; they stiffened their necks and would not obey.
21287	37	9	30	9	30	You were patient with them for many years, and Your Spirit admonished them through Your prophets. Yet they would not listen, so You gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.
21288	37	9	31	9	31	But in Your great compassion, You did not put an end to them; nor did You forsake them, for You are a gracious and compassionate God.
21289	37	9	32	9	32	So now, our God, the great and mighty and awesome God who keeps His gracious covenant, do not view lightly all the hardship that has come upon us, and upon our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets, our ancestors and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
21290	37	9	33	9	33	You are just in all that has befallen us, because You have acted faithfully, while we have acted wickedly.
21291	37	9	34	9	34	Our kings and leaders and priests and fathers did not obey Your law or listen to Your commandments and warnings that You gave them.
21292	37	9	35	9	35	For even while they were in their kingdom, with the abundant goodness You had given them, and in the spacious and fertile land You set before them, they would not serve You or turn from their wicked ways.
21293	37	9	36	9	36	So here we are today as slaves in the land You gave our fathers to enjoy its fruit and goodness—here we are as slaves!
21294	37	9	37	9	37	Its abundant harvest goes to the kings You have set over us because of our sins. And they rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please. We are in great distress.
21295	37	10	1	9	38	In view of all this, we make a binding agreement, putting it in writing and sealing it with the names of our leaders, Levites, and priests.”
21296	37	10	2	10	1	Now these were the ones who sealed the document: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and also Zedekiah,
21297	37	10	3	10	2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
21298	37	10	4	10	3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

21303	37	10	9	10	8	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
21304	37	10	10	10	9	The Levites: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,
21305	37	10	11	10	10	and their associates: Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
21306	37	10	12	10	11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
21307	37	10	13	10	12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
21308	37	10	14	10	13	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
21309	37	10	15	10	14	And the leaders of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
21310	37	10	16	10	15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
21311	37	10	17	10	16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
21312	37	10	18	10	17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
21313	37	10	19	10	18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
21314	37	10	20	10	19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
21315	37	10	21	10	20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
21316	37	10	22	10	21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
21317	37	10	23	10	22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
21318	37	10	24	10	23	Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
21319	37	10	25	10	24	Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
21320	37	10	26	10	25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
21321	37	10	27	10	26	Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
21322	37	10	28	10	27	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
21323	37	10	29	10	28	“The rest of the people—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, and temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the people of the land to obey the Law of God—along with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand,
21324	37	10	30	10	29	hereby join with their noble brothers and commit themselves with a sworn oath to follow the Law of God given through His servant Moses and to carefully obey all the commandments, ordinances, and statutes of the LORD our Lord.
21325	37	10	31	10	30	We will not give our daughters in marriage to the people of the land, and we will not take their daughters for our sons.
21326	37	10	32	10	31	When the people of the land bring merchandise or any kind of grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we will not buy from them on a Sabbath or holy day. Every seventh year we will let the fields lie fallow, and will cancel every debt.
21327	37	10	33	10	32	We also place ourselves under the obligation to contribute a third of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God:
21328	37	10	34	10	33	for the showbread, for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings, for the Sabbath offerings, for the New Moons and appointed feasts, for the holy offerings, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the duties of the house of our God.
21329	37	10	35	10	34	We have cast lots among the priests, Levites, and people for the donation of wood by our families at the appointed times each year. They are to bring it to the house of our God to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law.
21330	37	10	36	10	35	We will also bring the firstfruits of our land and of every fruit tree to the house of the LORD year by year.
21331	37	10	37	10	36	And we will bring the firstborn of our sons and our livestock, as it is written in the Law, and will bring the firstborn of our herds and flocks to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God.
21332	37	10	38	10	37	Moreover, we will bring to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God the firstfruits of our dough, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees, and of our new wine and oil. A tenth of our produce belongs to the Levites, so that they shall receive tithes in all the towns where we labor.
21333	37	10	39	10	38	A priest of Aaron’s line is to accompany the Levites when they collect the tenth, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of these tithes to the storerooms of the treasury in the house of our God.
21334	37	10	40	10	39	For the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of grain, new wine, and oil to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept and where the ministering priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers stay. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.”
21335	37	11	1	11	1	Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in the holy city of Jerusalem, while the remaining nine were to dwell in their own cities.
21336	37	11	2	11	2	And the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
21337	37	11	3	11	3	These are the heads of the provinces who settled in Jerusalem. (In the villages of Judah, however, each lived on his own property in their towns—the Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants—
21338	37	11	4	11	4	while some of the descendants of Judah and Benjamin settled in Jerusalem.) From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez;
21339	37	11	5	11	5	and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah.
21340	37	11	6	11	6	The descendants of Perez who settled in Jerusalem totaled 468 men of valor.
21341	37	11	7	11	7	From the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah;
21342	37	11	8	11	8	and his followers Gabbai and Sallai—928 men.
21343	37	11	9	11	9	Joel son of Zichri was the officer over them, and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the Second District of the city.
21344	37	11	10	11	10	From the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib; Jachin;
21345	37	11	11	11	11	Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the chief official of the house of God;
21346	37	11	12	11	12	and their associates who did the work at the temple—822 men; Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah;
21347	37	11	13	11	13	and his associates, the leaders of families—242 men; Amashai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer;
21348	37	11	14	11	14	and his associates—128 mighty men of valor. Zabdiel son of Haggedolim was their overseer.
21349	37	11	15	11	15	From the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
21350	37	11	16	11	16	Shabbethai and Jozabad, two leaders of the Levites, who supervised the work outside the house of God;
21351	37	11	17	11	17	Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who led in thanksgiving and prayer; Bakbukiah, second among his associates; and Abda son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
21352	37	11	18	11	18	The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
21353	37	11	19	11	19	And the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their associates, who kept watch at the gates—172 men.
21354	37	11	20	11	20	The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, were in all the villages of Judah, each on his own inheritance.
21355	37	11	21	11	21	The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, with Ziha and Gishpa over them.
21356	37	11	22	11	22	Now the overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. He was one of Asaph’s descendants, who were the singers in charge of the service of the house of God.
21357	37	11	23	11	23	For there was a command from the king concerning the singers, an ordinance regulating their daily activities.
21358	37	11	24	11	24	Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s agent in every matter concerning the people.
21359	37	11	25	11	25	As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba, Dibon, Jekabzeel, and their villages;
21360	37	11	26	11	26	in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth-pelet;
21361	37	11	27	11	27	in Hazar-shual; in Beersheba and its villages;
21362	37	11	28	11	28	in Ziklag; in Meconah and its villages;
21363	37	11	29	11	29	in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,
21364	37	11	30	11	30	Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages; in Lachish and its fields; and in Azekah and its villages. So they settled from Beersheba all the way to the Valley of Hinnom.
21365	37	11	31	11	31	The descendants of Benjamin from Geba lived in Michmash, Aija, and Bethel with its villages;
21366	37	11	32	11	32	in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
21367	37	11	33	11	33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
21368	37	11	34	11	34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
21369	37	11	35	11	35	Lod, and Ono; and in the Valley of the Craftsmen.
21370	37	11	36	11	36	And some divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.
21371	37	12	1	12	1	Now these are the priests and Levites who went up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
21372	37	12	2	12	2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
21373	37	12	3	12	3	Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
21374	37	12	4	12	4	Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
21375	37	12	5	12	5	Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
21376	37	12	6	12	6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
21377	37	12	7	12	7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
21378	37	12	8	12	8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who, with his associates, led the songs of thanksgiving.
21379	37	12	9	12	9	Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood across from them in the services.
21380	37	12	10	12	10	Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim was the father of Eliashib, Eliashib was the father of Joiada,
21381	37	12	11	12	11	Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
21382	37	12	12	12	12	In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families: of the family of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
21383	37	12	13	12	13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
21384	37	12	14	12	14	of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
21385	37	12	15	12	15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
21386	37	12	16	12	16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
21387	37	12	17	12	17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin and of Moadiah, Piltai;
21388	37	12	18	12	18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jonathan;
21389	37	12	19	12	19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
21390	37	12	20	12	20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
21391	37	12	21	12	21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
21392	37	12	22	12	22	In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, during the reign of Darius the Persian, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded.
21393	37	12	23	12	23	As for the descendants of Levi, the family heads up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles.
21394	37	12	24	12	24	The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their associates, who stood across from them to give praise and thanksgiving as one section alternated with the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
21395	37	12	25	12	25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
21396	37	12	26	12	26	They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.
21397	37	12	27	12	27	At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their homes and brought to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
21398	37	12	28	12	28	The singers were also assembled from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
21399	37	12	29	12	29	from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
21400	37	12	30	12	30	After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
21401	37	12	31	12	31	Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and I appointed two great thanksgiving choirs. One was to proceed along the top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
21402	37	12	32	12	32	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed,
21403	37	12	33	12	33	along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
21404	37	12	34	12	34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
21405	37	12	35	12	35	and some of the priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
21406	37	12	36	12	36	and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani—with the musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession.
21407	37	12	37	12	37	At the Fountain Gate they climbed the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
21408	37	12	38	12	38	The second thanksgiving choir proceeded to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
21409	37	12	39	12	39	over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
21410	37	12	40	12	40	The two thanksgiving choirs then stood in the house of God, as did I, along with the half of the officials accompanying me,
21411	37	12	41	12	41	as well as the priests with their trumpets—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah—
21412	37	12	42	12	42	and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the choirs sang out under the direction of Jezrahiah.
21413	37	12	43	12	43	On that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
21414	37	12	44	12	44	And on that same day men were appointed over the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. The portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites were gathered into these storerooms from the fields of the villages, because Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who were serving.
21415	37	12	45	12	45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed.
21416	37	12	46	12	46	For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
21417	37	12	47	12	47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron.
21418	37	13	1	13	1	At that time the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people, and in it they found the passage stating that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
21419	37	13	2	13	2	because they had not met the Israelites with food and water, but had hired Balaam to call down a curse against them (although our God had turned the curse into a blessing).
21420	37	13	3	13	3	As soon as the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all of foreign descent.
21421	37	13	4	13	4	Now before this, Eliashib the priest, a relative of Tobiah, had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God
21422	37	13	5	13	5	and had prepared for Tobiah a large room where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the temple articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests.
21423	37	13	6	13	6	While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to Artaxerxes king of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign. Some time later I obtained leave from the king
21424	37	13	7	13	7	to return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.
21425	37	13	8	13	8	And I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
21426	37	13	9	13	9	Then I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored to them, along with the grain offerings and frankincense.
21427	37	13	10	13	10	I also learned that because the portions for the Levites had not been given to them, all the Levites and singers responsible for performing the service had gone back to their own fields.
21428	37	13	11	13	11	So I rebuked the officials and asked, “Why has the house of God been neglected?” Then I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts,
21429	37	13	12	13	12	and all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms.
21430	37	13	13	13	13	I appointed as treasurers over the storerooms Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy. They were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.
21431	37	13	14	13	14	Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out my deeds of loving devotion for the house of my God and for its services.
21432	37	13	15	13	15	In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.
21433	37	13	16	13	16	Additionally, men of Tyre who lived there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
21434	37	13	17	13	17	Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah and asked, “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day?
21435	37	13	18	13	18	Did not your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling His wrath against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!”
21436	37	13	19	13	19	When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem, just before the Sabbath, I ordered that the gates be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.
21437	37	13	20	13	20	Once or twice, the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,
21438	37	13	21	13	21	but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they did not return on the Sabbath.
21439	37	13	22	13	22	Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this as well, O my God, and show me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion.
21440	37	13	23	13	23	In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
21441	37	13	24	13	24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of the other peoples, but could not speak the language of Judah.
21442	37	13	25	13	25	I rebuked them and called down curses on them. I beat some of these men and pulled out their hair. Then I made them take an oath before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves!
21443	37	13	26	13	26	Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin.
21444	37	13	27	13	27	Must we now hear that you too are doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”
21445	37	13	28	13	28	Even one of the sons of Jehoiada son of Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I drove him away from me.
21446	37	13	29	13	29	Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
21447	37	13	30	13	30	Thus I purified the priests and Levites from everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.
21448	37	13	31	13	31	I also arranged for contributions of wood at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, with favor.
21449	38	1	1	1	1	Adam, Seth, Enosh,
21450	38	1	2	1	2	Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared,
21451	38	1	3	1	3	Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech.
21452	38	1	4	1	4	The sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
21453	38	1	5	1	5	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
21454	38	1	6	1	6	The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
21455	38	1	7	1	7	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites.
21456	38	1	8	1	8	The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
21457	38	1	9	1	9	The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabta, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
21458	38	1	10	1	10	Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth.
21459	38	1	11	1	11	Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,
21460	38	1	12	1	12	the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites.
21461	38	1	13	1	13	And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
21462	38	1	14	1	14	the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
21463	38	1	15	1	15	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
21464	38	1	16	1	16	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites.
21465	38	1	17	1	17	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech.
21466	38	1	18	1	18	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber.
21467	38	1	19	1	19	Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.
21468	38	1	20	1	20	And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
21469	38	1	21	1	21	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
21470	38	1	22	1	22	Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
21471	38	1	23	1	23	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
21472	38	1	24	1	24	So from Shem came Arphaxad, Shelah,
21473	38	1	25	1	25	Eber, Peleg, Reu,
21474	38	1	26	1	26	Serug, Nahor, Terah,
21475	38	1	27	1	27	and Abram (that is, Abraham).
21476	38	1	28	1	28	The sons of Abraham were Isaac and Ishmael.
21477	38	1	29	1	29	These are their genealogies: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
21478	38	1	30	1	30	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema,
21479	38	1	31	1	31	Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael.
21480	38	1	32	1	32	The sons born to Keturah, Abraham’s concubine: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. The sons of Jokshan: Sheba and Dedan.
21481	38	1	33	1	33	The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these were Keturah’s sons.
21482	38	1	34	1	34	Abraham was the father of Isaac. The sons of Isaac: Esau and Israel.

21620	38	4	39	4	39	and they journeyed to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks.
21621	38	4	40	4	40	There they found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful, and quiet; for some Hamites had lived there formerly.
21622	38	4	41	4	41	These who were noted by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites and Meunites there in their dwellings, devoting them to destruction even to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks.
21623	38	4	42	4	42	And five hundred of these Simeonites led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir
21624	38	4	43	4	43	and struck down the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped. And they have lived there to this day.
21625	38	5	1	5	1	These were the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel. Though he was the firstborn, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, because Reuben defiled his father’s bed. So he is not reckoned according to birthright.
21626	38	5	2	5	2	And though Judah prevailed over his brothers and a ruler came from him, the birthright belonged to Joseph.
21627	38	5	3	5	3	The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

21631	38	5	7	5	7	His relatives by their clans are recorded in their genealogy: Jeiel the chief, Zechariah,
21632	38	5	8	5	8	and Bela son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel. They settled in Aroer and as far as Nebo and Baal-meon.
21633	38	5	9	5	9	They also settled in the east as far as the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because their herds had increased in the land of Gilead.
21634	38	5	10	5	10	During the days of Saul they waged war against the Hagrites, who were defeated at their hands, and they occupied the homes of the Hagrites throughout the region east of Gilead.
21635	38	5	11	5	11	The descendants of Gad lived next to the Reubenites in the land of Bashan, as far as Salecah:
21636	38	5	12	5	12	Joel was the chief, Shapham the second, then Jaanai and Shaphat, who lived in Bashan.

21640	38	5	16	5	16	They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its towns, and throughout the pasturelands of Sharon.
21641	38	5	17	5	17	All of them were reckoned in the genealogies during the reigns of Jotham king of Judah and Jeroboam king of Israel.
21642	38	5	18	5	18	The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors—valiant men who carried the shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for battle.
21643	38	5	19	5	19	They waged war against the Hagrites, as well as Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
21644	38	5	20	5	20	And because they cried out to God in battle, they were helped against their enemies, and the Hagrites and all their allies were delivered into their hands. Because they put their trust in God, He answered their prayers.
21645	38	5	21	5	21	They seized the livestock of the Hagrites—50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also took 100,000 captives,
21646	38	5	22	5	22	and many others fell slain, because the battle belonged to God. And they occupied the land until the exile.
21647	38	5	23	5	23	Now the people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous. They settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon (that is, Senir, also known as Mount Hermon).
21648	38	5	24	5	24	These were the heads of their families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of their families.
21649	38	5	25	5	25	But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and they prostituted themselves with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
21650	38	5	26	5	26	So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria) to take the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. And he brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this day.

21830	38	9	19	9	19	Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his relatives from the Korahites were assigned to guard the thresholds of the Tent, just as their fathers had been assigned to guard the entrance to the dwelling of the LORD.
21831	38	9	20	9	20	In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar had been in charge of the gatekeepers, and the LORD was with him.
21832	38	9	21	9	21	Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
21833	38	9	22	9	22	The number of those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds was 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their positions of trust.
21834	38	9	23	9	23	So they and their descendants were assigned to guard the gates of the house of the LORD—the house called the Tent.
21835	38	9	24	9	24	The gatekeepers were stationed on the four sides: east, west, north, and south.
21836	38	9	25	9	25	Their relatives came from their villages at fixed times to serve with them for seven-day periods.
21837	38	9	26	9	26	But the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the rooms and the treasuries of the house of God.
21838	38	9	27	9	27	They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they were responsible for guarding it and opening it every morning.
21839	38	9	28	9	28	Some of them were in charge of the articles used in worship, to count them whenever they were brought in or taken out.
21840	38	9	29	9	29	Others were put in charge of the furnishings and other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the fine flour, wine, oil, frankincense, and spices.
21841	38	9	30	9	30	And some of the sons of the priests mixed the spices.
21842	38	9	31	9	31	A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with baking the bread.
21843	38	9	32	9	32	Some of their Kohathite brothers were responsible for preparing the rows of the showbread every Sabbath.
21844	38	9	33	9	33	Those who were musicians, the heads of Levite families, stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from other duties because they were on duty day and night.
21845	38	9	34	9	34	All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs according to their genealogies, and lived in Jerusalem.
21846	38	9	35	9	35	Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived in Gibeon. His wife’s name was Maacah.
21847	38	9	36	9	36	Abdon was his firstborn son, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
21848	38	9	37	9	37	Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
21849	38	9	38	9	38	Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They too lived alongside their relatives in Jerusalem.
21850	38	9	39	9	39	Ner was the father of Kish, Kish was the father of Saul, and Saul was the father of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
21851	38	9	40	9	40	The son of Jonathan: Merib-baal, who was the father of Micah.
21852	38	9	41	9	41	The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz.
21853	38	9	42	9	42	Ahaz was the father of Jarah; Jarah was the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri was the father of Moza.
21854	38	9	43	9	43	Moza was the father of Binea. Rephaiah was his son, Elasah his son, and Azel his son.
21855	38	9	44	9	44	And Azel had six sons, and these were their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.
21856	38	10	1	10	1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
21857	38	10	2	10	2	The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
21858	38	10	3	10	3	When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him.
21859	38	10	4	10	4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!” But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
21860	38	10	5	10	5	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died.
21861	38	10	6	10	6	So Saul died together with his three sons and all his house.
21862	38	10	7	10	7	When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities.
21863	38	10	8	10	8	The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
21864	38	10	9	10	9	They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.
21865	38	10	10	10	10	They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.
21866	38	10	11	10	11	When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard about everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
21867	38	10	12	10	12	all their men of valor set out and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
21868	38	10	13	10	13	So Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,
21869	38	10	14	10	14	and he failed to inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
21870	38	11	1	11	1	Then all Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
21871	38	11	2	11	2	Even in times past, while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD your God said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’”
21872	38	11	3	11	3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where David made a covenant with them before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD through Samuel.
21873	38	11	4	11	4	Then David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus), where the Jebusites inhabited the land.
21874	38	11	5	11	5	The people of Jebus said to David, “You will never get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
21875	38	11	6	11	6	Now David had said, “Whoever is the first to strike down a Jebusite will become chief commander.” And Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and he became the chief.
21876	38	11	7	11	7	So David took up residence in the fortress; that is why it was called the City of David.
21877	38	11	8	11	8	He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.
21878	38	11	9	11	9	And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of Hosts was with him.
21879	38	11	10	11	10	Now these were the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who, together with all Israel, gave strong support to his kingdom, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
21880	38	11	11	11	11	This is the list of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the officers; he wielded his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed at one time.
21881	38	11	12	11	12	Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.
21882	38	11	13	11	13	He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At the place with a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.
21883	38	11	14	11	14	But Eleazar and David stationed themselves in the middle of the field and defended it. They struck down the Philistines, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
21884	38	11	15	11	15	Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
21885	38	11	16	11	16	At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
21886	38	11	17	11	17	David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
21887	38	11	18	11	18	So the Three broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD,
21888	38	11	19	11	19	saying, “Far be it from me, my God, to do this! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives, David refused to drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
21889	38	11	20	11	20	Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Three, and he lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three.
21890	38	11	21	11	21	He was doubly honored above the Three, and he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three.
21891	38	11	22	11	22	And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.
21892	38	11	23	11	23	He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s beam in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.
21893	38	11	24	11	24	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
21894	38	11	25	11	25	He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.
21895	38	11	26	11	26	Now these were the mighty men: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
21896	38	11	27	11	27	Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
21897	38	11	28	11	28	Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
21898	38	11	29	11	29	Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
21899	38	11	30	11	30	Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
21900	38	11	31	11	31	Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamites, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
21901	38	11	32	11	32	Hurai from the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
21902	38	11	33	11	33	Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
21903	38	11	34	11	34	the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
21904	38	11	35	11	35	Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
21905	38	11	36	11	36	Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
21906	38	11	37	11	37	Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
21907	38	11	38	11	38	Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
21908	38	11	39	11	39	Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
21909	38	11	40	11	40	Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
21910	38	11	41	11	41	Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
21911	38	11	42	11	42	Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites, and the thirty with him,
21912	38	11	43	11	43	Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
21913	38	11	44	11	44	Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
21914	38	11	45	11	45	Jediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,
21915	38	11	46	11	46	Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
21916	38	11	47	11	47	Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
21917	38	12	1	12	1	Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the mighty men who helped him in battle;
21918	38	12	2	12	2	they were archers using both the right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows; and they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin):
21919	38	12	3	12	3	Ahiezer their chief and Joash, who were the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite;
21920	38	12	4	12	4	Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty;
21921	38	12	5	12	4	Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;
21922	38	12	6	12	5	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
21923	38	12	7	12	6	Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;
21924	38	12	8	12	7	and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
21925	38	12	9	12	8	Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty men of valor, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
21926	38	12	10	12	9	Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
21927	38	12	11	12	10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
21928	38	12	12	12	11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
21929	38	12	13	12	12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
21930	38	12	14	12	13	Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
21931	38	12	15	12	14	These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
21932	38	12	16	12	15	These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
21933	38	12	17	12	16	Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
21934	38	12	18	12	17	And David went out to meet them, saying, “If you have come to me in peace, to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.”
21935	38	12	19	12	18	Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said: “We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers, for your God helps you.” So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
21936	38	12	20	12	19	Some from Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away, saying, “It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”)
21937	38	12	21	12	20	When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
21938	38	12	22	12	21	They helped David against the raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and commanders in the army.
21939	38	12	23	12	22	For at that time men came to David day after day to help him, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
21940	38	12	24	12	23	Now these are the numbers of men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of the LORD:
21941	38	12	25	12	24	From Judah: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.
21942	38	12	26	12	25	From Simeon: 7,100 mighty men of valor, ready for battle.
21943	38	12	27	12	26	From Levi: 4,600,
21944	38	12	28	12	27	including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
21945	38	12	29	12	28	and Zadok, a mighty young man of valor, with 22 commanders from his own family.
21946	38	12	30	12	29	From Benjamin, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time.
21947	38	12	31	12	30	From Ephraim: 20,800 mighty men of valor, famous among their own clans.
21948	38	12	32	12	31	From the half-tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
21949	38	12	33	12	32	From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their kinsmen at their command.
21950	38	12	34	12	33	From Zebulun: 50,000 fit for service, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, who with one purpose were devoted to David.
21951	38	12	35	12	34	From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
21952	38	12	36	12	35	From Dan: 28,600 prepared for battle.
21953	38	12	37	12	36	From Asher: 40,000 fit for service, prepared for battle.
21954	38	12	38	12	37	And from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh there: 120,000 armed with every kind of weapon of war.
21955	38	12	39	12	38	All these men of war, arrayed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind to make David king.
21956	38	12	40	12	39	They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them.
21957	38	12	41	12	40	And their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.
21958	38	13	1	13	1	Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
21959	38	13	2	13	2	And he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us.
21960	38	13	3	13	3	Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him in the days of Saul.”
21961	38	13	4	13	4	And because this proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it.
21962	38	13	5	13	5	So David assembled all Israel, from the River Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
21963	38	13	6	13	6	David and all Israel went up to Baalah of Judah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name.
21964	38	13	7	13	7	So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart.
21965	38	13	8	13	8	David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
21966	38	13	9	13	9	When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
21967	38	13	10	13	10	And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
21968	38	13	11	13	11	Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as it is called to this day.
21969	38	13	12	13	12	That day David feared God and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
21970	38	13	13	13	13	So he did not move the ark with him to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
21971	38	13	14	13	14	Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he owned.
21972	38	14	1	14	1	Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters, to build a palace for him.
21973	38	14	2	14	2	And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
21974	38	14	3	14	3	And David took more wives in Jerusalem and became the father of more sons and daughters.
21975	38	14	4	14	4	These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
21976	38	14	5	14	5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
21977	38	14	6	14	6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
21978	38	14	7	14	7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
21979	38	14	8	14	8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went out to face them.
21980	38	14	9	14	9	Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
21981	38	14	10	14	10	So David inquired of God, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” “Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will deliver them into your hand.”
21982	38	14	11	14	11	So David and his men went up to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.” So they called that place Baal-perazim.
21983	38	14	12	14	12	There the Philistines abandoned their gods, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
21984	38	14	13	14	13	Once again the Philistines raided the valley.
21985	38	14	14	14	14	So David again inquired of God, who answered him, “Do not march up after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
21986	38	14	15	14	15	As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then move out to battle, because this will mean that God has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
21987	38	14	16	14	16	So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
21988	38	14	17	14	17	And David’s fame went out into every land, and the LORD caused all nations to fear him.
21989	38	15	1	15	1	David constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
21990	38	15	2	15	2	Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever.”
21991	38	15	3	15	3	And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
21992	38	15	4	15	4	Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
21993	38	15	5	15	5	From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives;
21994	38	15	6	15	6	from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;
21995	38	15	7	15	7	from the Gershomites, Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;
21996	38	15	8	15	8	from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;
21997	38	15	9	15	9	from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;
21998	38	15	10	15	10	and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.
21999	38	15	11	15	11	David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
22000	38	15	12	15	12	And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
22001	38	15	13	15	13	It was because you Levites were not with us the first time that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us. For we did not consult Him about the proper order.”
22002	38	15	14	15	14	So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
22003	38	15	15	15	15	And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.
22004	38	15	16	15	16	David also told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals.
22005	38	15	17	15	17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
22006	38	15	18	15	18	and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
22007	38	15	19	15	19	The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals.
22008	38	15	20	15	20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth.
22009	38	15	21	15	21	And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.
22010	38	15	22	15	22	Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he was highly skilled.
22011	38	15	23	15	23	Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians of the ark.
22012	38	15	24	15	24	Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.
22013	38	15	25	15	25	So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom.
22014	38	15	26	15	26	And because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
22015	38	15	27	15	27	Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.
22016	38	15	28	15	28	So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres.
22017	38	15	29	15	29	As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
22018	38	16	1	16	1	So they brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
22019	38	16	2	16	2	When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
22020	38	16	3	16	3	Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
22021	38	16	4	16	4	David appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
22022	38	16	5	16	5	Asaph was the chief, Zechariah was second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They were to play the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals
22023	38	16	6	16	6	and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
22024	38	16	7	16	7	On that day David first committed to Asaph and his brothers this song of thanksgiving to the LORD:
22025	38	16	8	16	8	“Give thanks to the LORD; call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.
22026	38	16	9	16	9	Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.
22027	38	16	10	16	10	Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
22028	38	16	11	16	11	Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.
22029	38	16	12	16	12	Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,
22030	38	16	13	16	13	O offspring of His servant Israel, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
22031	38	16	14	16	14	He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.
22032	38	16	15	16	15	Remember His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—
22033	38	16	16	16	16	the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.
22034	38	16	17	16	17	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
22035	38	16	18	16	18	‘I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.’
22036	38	16	19	16	19	When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,
22037	38	16	20	16	20	they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
22038	38	16	21	16	21	He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
22039	38	16	22	16	22	‘Do not touch My anointed ones! Do no harm to My prophets!’
22040	38	16	23	16	23	Sing to the LORD, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation day after day.
22041	38	16	24	16	24	Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
22042	38	16	25	16	25	For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
22043	38	16	26	16	26	For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.
22044	38	16	27	16	27	Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy fill His dwelling.
22045	38	16	28	16	28	Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
22046	38	16	29	16	29	Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;
22047	38	16	30	16	30	tremble before Him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
22048	38	16	31	16	31	Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice. Let them say among the nations, ‘The LORD reigns!’
22049	38	16	32	16	32	Let the sea resound, and all that fills it; let the fields exult, and all that is in them.
22050	38	16	33	16	33	Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the LORD, for He is coming to judge the earth.
22051	38	16	34	16	34	Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
22052	38	16	35	16	35	Then cry out: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation; gather and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name, that we may glory in Your praise.’
22053	38	16	36	16	36	Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.” Then all the people said, “Amen!” and “Praise the LORD!”
22054	38	16	37	16	37	So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to minister there regularly according to the daily requirements,
22055	38	16	38	16	38	along with Obed-edom and his sixty-eight relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were to be gatekeepers.
22056	38	16	39	16	39	And David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon
22057	38	16	40	16	40	to regularly present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the Law of the LORD, which He had commanded Israel to keep.
22058	38	16	41	16	41	With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, for “His loving devotion endures forever.”
22059	38	16	42	16	42	Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for the songs of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
22060	38	16	43	16	43	Then all the people departed for their homes, and David returned home to bless his household.
22061	38	17	1	17	1	After David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.”
22062	38	17	2	17	2	And Nathan replied to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
22063	38	17	3	17	3	But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
22064	38	17	4	17	4	“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house in which to dwell.
22065	38	17	5	17	5	For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up from Egypt until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling.
22066	38	17	6	17	6	In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’
22067	38	17	7	17	7	Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel.
22068	38	17	8	17	8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
22069	38	17	9	17	9	And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning
22070	38	17	10	17	10	and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you.
22071	38	17	11	17	11	And when your days are fulfilled and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
22072	38	17	12	17	12	He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.
22073	38	17	13	17	13	I will be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor.
22074	38	17	14	17	14	But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.”
22075	38	17	15	17	15	So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision.
22076	38	17	16	17	16	Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
22077	38	17	17	17	17	And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God, You have spoken about the future of the house of Your servant and have regarded me as a man of great distinction, O LORD God.
22078	38	17	18	17	18	What more can David say to You for so honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant,
22079	38	17	19	17	19	O LORD. For the sake of Your servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed all Your greatness.
22080	38	17	20	17	20	O LORD, there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears.
22081	38	17	21	17	21	And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself? You made a name for Yourself through great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt.
22082	38	17	22	17	22	For You have made Your people Israel Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.
22083	38	17	23	17	23	And now, O LORD, let the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever. Do as You have promised,
22084	38	17	24	17	24	so that Your name will be established and magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.’ And may the house of Your servant David be established before You.
22085	38	17	25	17	25	For You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has found the courage to pray before You.
22086	38	17	26	17	26	And now, O LORD, You are God! And You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
22087	38	17	27	17	27	So now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever.”
22088	38	18	1	18	1	Some time later, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from the hand of the Philistines.
22089	38	18	2	18	2	David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to David and brought him tribute.
22090	38	18	3	18	3	As far as Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, who had marched out to establish his dominion along the Euphrates River.
22091	38	18	4	18	4	David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
22092	38	18	5	18	5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
22093	38	18	6	18	6	Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
22094	38	18	7	18	7	And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
22095	38	18	8	18	8	And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles.
22096	38	18	9	18	9	When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
22097	38	18	10	18	10	he sent his son Hadoram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze,
22098	38	18	11	18	11	and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites.
22099	38	18	12	18	12	Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
22100	38	18	13	18	13	He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
22101	38	18	14	18	14	Thus David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people:
22102	38	18	15	18	15	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder;
22103	38	18	16	18	16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was the scribe;
22104	38	18	17	18	17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief officials at the king’s side.
22105	38	19	1	19	1	Some time later, Nahash king of the Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son.
22106	38	19	2	19	2	And David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,
22107	38	19	3	19	3	the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you really believe he is showing respect for your father? Have not his servants come to you to explore the land, spy it out, and overthrow it?”
22108	38	19	4	19	4	So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.
22109	38	19	5	19	5	When someone came and told David about his men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”
22110	38	19	6	19	6	When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
22111	38	19	7	19	7	So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites came from their cities and marched out for battle.
22112	38	19	8	19	8	On hearing this, David sent Joab and the entire army of mighty men.
22113	38	19	9	19	9	The Ammonites marched out and arrayed themselves for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open country.
22114	38	19	10	19	10	When Joab saw the battle lines before him and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Arameans.
22115	38	19	11	19	11	And he placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites.
22116	38	19	12	19	12	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue.
22117	38	19	13	19	13	Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.”
22118	38	19	14	19	14	So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the Arameans, who fled before him.
22119	38	19	15	19	15	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai, and they entered the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
22120	38	19	16	19	16	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them.
22121	38	19	17	19	17	When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him.
22122	38	19	18	19	18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
22123	38	19	19	19	19	When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites anymore.
22124	38	20	1	20	1	In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the Ammonites. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.
22125	38	20	2	20	2	Then David took the crown from the head of their king. It was found to weigh a talent of gold and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
22126	38	20	3	20	3	David brought out the people who were there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
22127	38	20	4	20	4	Some time later, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued.
22128	38	20	5	20	5	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
22129	38	20	6	20	6	And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,
22130	38	20	7	20	7	and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
22131	38	20	8	20	8	So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.
22132	38	21	1	21	1	Then Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
22133	38	21	2	21	2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”
22134	38	21	3	21	3	But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
22135	38	21	4	21	4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem.
22136	38	21	5	21	5	And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah.
22137	38	21	6	21	6	But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him.
22138	38	21	7	21	7	This command was also evil in the sight of God; so He struck Israel.
22139	38	21	8	21	8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
22140	38	21	9	21	9	And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s seer,
22141	38	21	10	21	10	“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’”
22142	38	21	11	21	11	So Gad went and said to David, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your choice
22143	38	21	12	21	12	of either three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
22144	38	21	13	21	13	David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
22145	38	21	14	21	14	So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
22146	38	21	15	21	15	Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so the LORD saw it and relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
22147	38	21	16	21	16	When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
22148	38	21	17	21	17	And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.”
22149	38	21	18	21	18	Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
22150	38	21	19	21	19	So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.
22151	38	21	20	21	20	Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
22152	38	21	21	21	21	David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David.
22153	38	21	22	21	22	Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”
22154	38	21	23	21	23	Ornan said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.”
22155	38	21	24	21	24	“No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
22156	38	21	25	21	25	So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
22157	38	21	26	21	26	And there he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
22158	38	21	27	21	27	Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath.
22159	38	21	28	21	28	At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
22160	38	21	29	21	29	For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon,
22161	38	21	30	21	30	but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
22162	38	22	1	22	1	Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
22163	38	22	2	22	2	So David gave orders to gather the foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters to prepare finished stones for building the house of God.
22164	38	22	3	22	3	David provided a large quantity of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with more bronze than could be weighed
22165	38	22	4	22	4	and more cedar logs than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
22166	38	22	5	22	5	And David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands. Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish preparations before his death.
22167	38	22	6	22	6	Then David called for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
22168	38	22	7	22	7	“My son,” said David to Solomon, “it was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God,
22169	38	22	8	22	8	but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.
22170	38	22	9	22	9	But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
22171	38	22	10	22	10	He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
22172	38	22	11	22	11	Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would.
22173	38	22	12	22	12	Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God.
22174	38	22	13	22	13	Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
22175	38	22	14	22	14	Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them.
22176	38	22	15	22	15	You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work—
22177	38	22	16	22	16	in gold and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.”
22178	38	22	17	22	17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:
22179	38	22	18	22	18	“Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people.
22180	38	22	19	22	19	Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”
22181	38	23	1	23	1	When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
22182	38	23	2	23	2	Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
22183	38	23	3	23	3	The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000.
22184	38	23	4	23	4	“Of these,” said David, “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,
22185	38	23	5	23	5	4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I have made for giving praise.”
22186	38	23	6	23	6	Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
22187	38	23	7	23	7	The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
22188	38	23	8	23	8	The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all.
22189	38	23	9	23	9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
22190	38	23	10	23	10	And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
22191	38	23	11	23	11	Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.
22192	38	23	12	23	12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all.
22193	38	23	13	23	13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.
22194	38	23	14	23	14	As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
22195	38	23	15	23	15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
22196	38	23	16	23	16	The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first.
22197	38	23	17	23	17	The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
22198	38	23	18	23	18	The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.
22199	38	23	19	23	19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
22200	38	23	20	23	20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah was the first and Isshiah the second.
22201	38	23	21	23	21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
22202	38	23	22	23	22	Eleazar died without having any sons; he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
22203	38	23	23	23	23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth—three in all.
22204	38	23	24	23	24	These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families, registered individually by name—those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of the LORD.
22205	38	23	25	23	25	For David had said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, has given rest to His people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever.
22206	38	23	26	23	26	So now the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.”
22207	38	23	27	23	27	For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted,
22208	38	23	28	23	28	but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God,
22209	38	23	29	23	29	as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
22210	38	23	30	23	30	They were also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.
22211	38	23	31	23	31	Whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them.
22212	38	23	32	23	32	So the Levites were to carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the service of the house of the LORD.
22213	38	24	1	24	1	These were the divisions of the descendants of Aaron. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
22214	38	24	2	24	2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
22215	38	24	3	24	3	With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service.
22216	38	24	4	24	4	Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar.
22217	38	24	5	24	5	Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.
22218	38	24	6	24	6	The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar.
22219	38	24	7	24	7	The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
22220	38	24	8	24	8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
22221	38	24	9	24	9	the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
22222	38	24	10	24	10	the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
22223	38	24	11	24	11	the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
22224	38	24	12	24	12	the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
22225	38	24	13	24	13	the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
22226	38	24	14	24	14	the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
22227	38	24	15	24	15	the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
22228	38	24	16	24	16	the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
22229	38	24	17	24	17	the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
22230	38	24	18	24	18	the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
22231	38	24	19	24	19	This was their appointed order for service when they entered the house of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
22232	38	24	20	24	20	Now these were the remaining descendants of Levi: From the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
22233	38	24	21	24	21	As for Rehabiah, from his sons: The first was Isshiah.
22234	38	24	22	24	22	From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
22235	38	24	23	24	23	From the sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
22236	38	24	24	24	24	From the sons of Uzziel: Micah; from the sons of Micah: Shamir.
22237	38	24	25	24	25	The brother of Micah: Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.
22238	38	24	26	24	26	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
22239	38	24	27	24	27	The descendants of Merari from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
22240	38	24	28	24	28	From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
22241	38	24	29	24	29	From Kish: Jerahmeel the son of Kish.
22242	38	24	30	24	30	And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, according to their families.
22243	38	24	31	24	31	As their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, they also cast lots in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites—the family heads and their younger brothers alike.
22244	38	25	1	25	1	Additionally, David and the commanders of the army set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to prophesy with the accompaniment of lyres, harps, and cymbals. The following is the list of the men who performed this service:
22245	38	25	2	25	2	From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. These sons of Asaph were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king.
22246	38	25	3	25	3	From the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah—six in all—under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp, giving thanks and praise to the LORD.
22247	38	25	4	25	4	From the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
22248	38	25	5	25	5	All these sons of Heman the king’s seer were given him through the promises of God to exalt him, for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
22249	38	25	6	25	6	All these were under the direction of their fathers for the music of the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the direction of the king.
22250	38	25	7	25	7	Together with their relatives, who were all trained and skillful in the songs of the LORD, they numbered 288.
22251	38	25	8	25	8	They cast lots for their duties, young and old alike, teacher as well as pupil.
22252	38	25	9	25	9	The first lot, which was for Asaph, fell to Joseph, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all; the second to Gedaliah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22253	38	25	10	25	10	the third to Zaccur, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22254	38	25	11	25	11	the fourth to Izri, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22255	38	25	12	25	12	the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22256	38	25	13	25	13	the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22257	38	25	14	25	14	the seventh to Jesarelah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22258	38	25	15	25	15	the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22259	38	25	16	25	16	the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22260	38	25	17	25	17	the tenth to Shimei, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22261	38	25	18	25	18	the eleventh to Azarel, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22262	38	25	19	25	19	the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22263	38	25	20	25	20	the thirteenth to Shubael, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22264	38	25	21	25	21	the fourteenth to Mattithiah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22265	38	25	22	25	22	the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22266	38	25	23	25	23	the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22267	38	25	24	25	24	the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22268	38	25	25	25	25	the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22269	38	25	26	25	26	the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22270	38	25	27	25	27	the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22271	38	25	28	25	28	the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22272	38	25	29	25	29	the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22273	38	25	30	25	30	the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all;
22274	38	25	31	25	31	and the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer, his sons, and his brothers—12 in all.
22275	38	26	1	26	1	These were the divisions of the gatekeepers: From the Korahites: Meshelemiah son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.
22276	38	26	2	26	2	Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
22277	38	26	3	26	3	Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh.
22278	38	26	4	26	4	And Obed-edom also had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
22279	38	26	5	26	5	Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth. For God had blessed Obed-edom.
22280	38	26	6	26	6	Also to his son Shemaiah were born sons who ruled over their families because they were strong, capable men.
22281	38	26	7	26	7	Shemaiah’s sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; his brothers were Elihu and Semachiah, also capable men.
22282	38	26	8	26	8	All these were descendants of Obed-edom with their sons and brothers; they were capable men with strength to do the work—62 in all from Obed-edom.
22283	38	26	9	26	9	Meshelemiah also had sons and brothers who were capable men—18 in all.
22284	38	26	10	26	10	Hosah the Merarite also had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him as the first),
22285	38	26	11	26	11	Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and brothers of Hosah numbered 13 in all.
22286	38	26	12	26	12	These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their chief men, had duties for ministering in the house of the LORD, just as their brothers did.
22287	38	26	13	26	13	They cast lots for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike.
22288	38	26	14	26	14	The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah. Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and the lot for the North Gate fell to him.
22289	38	26	15	26	15	The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-edom, and the lot for the storehouses to his sons.
22290	38	26	16	26	16	The lots for the West Gate and the Shallecheth Gate on the ascending highway fell to Shuppim and Hosah. There were guards stationed at every watch.
22291	38	26	17	26	17	Each day there were six Levites on the east, four on the north, four on the south, and two pairs at the storehouse.
22292	38	26	18	26	18	As for the court on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the court.
22293	38	26	19	26	19	These were the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah and Merari.
22294	38	26	20	26	20	Now their fellow Levites were in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries of the dedicated things.
22295	38	26	21	26	21	From the descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan and heads of the families of Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli,
22296	38	26	22	26	22	the sons of Jehieli, Zetham, and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
22297	38	26	23	26	23	From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
22298	38	26	24	26	24	Shebuel, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the officer in charge of the treasuries.
22299	38	26	25	26	25	His relatives through Eliezer included Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
22300	38	26	26	26	26	This Shelomith and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and by the army commanders.
22301	38	26	27	26	27	They had dedicated some of the plunder from their battles to the repair of the house of the LORD.
22302	38	26	28	26	28	Everything that had been dedicated by Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah, along with everything else that was dedicated, was under the care of Shelomith and his brothers.
22303	38	26	29	26	29	From the Izrahites, Chenaniah and his sons had the outside duties as officers and judges over Israel.
22304	38	26	30	26	30	From the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives, 1,700 capable men, had charge of the affairs of Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service of the king.
22305	38	26	31	26	31	As for the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to the genealogies of his ancestors. In the fortieth year of David’s reign the records were searched, and strong, capable men were found among the Hebronites at Jazer in Gilead.
22306	38	26	32	26	32	Among Jerijah’s relatives there were 2,700 capable men who were heads of families. King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and to the affairs of the king.
22307	38	27	1	27	1	This is the list of the Israelites, the heads of families, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in every matter concerning the divisions that were on rotating military duty each month throughout the year.

22328	38	27	22	27	22	and over Dan was Azarel son of Jeroham. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
22329	38	27	23	27	23	David did not count the men aged twenty or under, because the LORD had said that He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of the sky.
22330	38	27	24	27	24	Joab son of Zeruiah began to count the men but did not finish. For because of this census wrath came upon Israel, and the number was not entered in the Book of the Chronicles of King David.
22331	38	27	25	27	25	Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge of the royal storehouses. Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses.
22332	38	27	26	27	26	Ezri son of Chelub was in charge of the workers in the fields who tilled the soil.
22333	38	27	27	27	27	Shimei the Ramathite was in charge of the vineyards. Zabdi the Shiphmite was in charge of the produce of the vineyards for the wine vats.
22334	38	27	28	27	28	Baal-hanan the Gederite was in charge of the olive and sycamore trees in the foothills. Joash was in charge of the stores of olive oil.
22335	38	27	29	27	29	Shitrai the Sharonite was in charge of the herds grazing in Sharon. Shaphat son of Adlai was in charge of the herds in the valleys.

22337	38	27	31	27	31	Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the flocks. All these officials were in charge of King David’s property.
22338	38	27	32	27	32	David’s uncle Jonathan was a counselor; he was a man of insight and a scribe. Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended to the sons of the king.
22339	38	27	33	27	33	Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
22340	38	27	34	27	34	Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah, then by Abiathar. Joab was the commander of the king’s army.
22341	38	28	1	28	1	Now David summoned all the leaders of Israel to Jerusalem: the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the divisions in the king’s service, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and cattle of the king and his sons, along with the court officials, the mighty men, and all the mighty men of valor.
22342	38	28	2	28	2	Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and as a footstool for our God. I had made preparations to build it,
22343	38	28	3	28	3	but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for My Name, because you are a man of war who has spilled blood.’
22344	38	28	4	28	4	Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah He chose my father’s household, and from my father’s sons He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
22345	38	28	5	28	5	And of all my sons—for the LORD has given me many sons—He has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
22346	38	28	6	28	6	And He said to me, ‘Solomon your son is the one who will build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father.
22347	38	28	7	28	7	I will establish his kingdom forever, if he resolutely carries out My commandments and ordinances, as is being done this day.’
22348	38	28	8	28	8	So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
22349	38	28	9	28	9	As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intent of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.
22350	38	28	10	28	10	Consider now that the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it.”
22351	38	28	11	28	11	Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, storehouses, upper rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat.
22352	38	28	12	28	12	The plans contained everything he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and of the dedicated things,
22353	38	28	13	28	13	for the divisions of the priests and Levites, for all the work of service in the house of the LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD:
22354	38	28	14	28	14	the weight of all the gold articles for every kind of service; the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service;
22355	38	28	15	28	15	the weight of the gold lampstands and their lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;
22356	38	28	16	28	16	the weight of gold for each table of showbread, and of silver for the silver tables;
22357	38	28	17	28	17	the weight of the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls, and pitchers; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl;
22358	38	28	18	28	18	the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense; and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
22359	38	28	19	28	19	“All this,” said David, “all the details of this plan, the LORD has made clear to me in writing by His hand upon me.”
22360	38	28	20	28	20	David also said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will neither fail you nor forsake you before all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
22361	38	28	21	28	21	The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the service of the house of God, and every willing man of every skill will be at your disposal for the work. The officials and all the people are fully at your command.”
22362	38	29	1	29	1	Then King David said to the whole assembly, “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great because this palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.
22363	38	29	2	29	2	Now with all my ability I have made provision for the house of my God—gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble—all in abundance.
22364	38	29	3	29	3	Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give for it my personal treasures of gold and silver, over and above all that I have provided for this holy temple:
22365	38	29	4	29	4	three thousand talents of gold (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings,
22366	38	29	5	29	5	for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the LORD today?”
22367	38	29	6	29	6	Then the leaders of the households, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
22368	38	29	7	29	7	Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron.
22369	38	29	8	29	8	Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
22370	38	29	9	29	9	And the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given to the LORD freely and wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly.
22371	38	29	10	29	10	Then David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly and said: “May You be blessed, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
22372	38	29	11	29	11	Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all.
22373	38	29	12	29	12	Both riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler over all. In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all.
22374	38	29	13	29	13	Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name.
22375	38	29	14	29	14	But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You.
22376	38	29	15	29	15	For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
22377	38	29	16	29	16	O LORD our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You.
22378	38	29	17	29	17	I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.
22379	38	29	18	29	18	O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You.
22380	38	29	19	29	19	And give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments, decrees, and statutes, and to build Your palace for which I have made provision.”
22381	38	29	20	29	20	Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the LORD your God.” So the whole assembly praised the LORD, the God of their fathers. They bowed down and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.
22382	38	29	21	29	21	The next day they offered sacrifices and presented burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
22383	38	29	22	29	22	That day they ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD. Then, for a second time, they designated David’s son Solomon as king, anointing him before the LORD as ruler, and Zadok as the priest.
22384	38	29	23	29	23	So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
22385	38	29	24	29	24	All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
22386	38	29	25	29	25	The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him.
22387	38	29	26	29	26	David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
22388	38	29	27	29	27	The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
22389	38	29	28	29	28	He died at a ripe old age, full of years, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon reigned in his place.
22390	38	29	29	29	29	Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are indeed written in the Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, the Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and the Chronicles of Gad the Seer,
22391	38	29	30	29	30	together with all the details of his reign, his might, and the circumstances that came upon him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.
22392	39	1	1	1	1	Now Solomon son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and highly exalted him.
22393	39	1	2	1	2	Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel—the heads of the families.
22394	39	1	3	1	3	And Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon because it was the location of God’s Tent of Meeting, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
22395	39	1	4	1	4	Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
22396	39	1	5	1	5	But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, was in Gibeon before the tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there.
22397	39	1	6	1	6	Solomon offered sacrifices there before the LORD on the bronze altar in the Tent of Meeting, where he offered a thousand burnt offerings.
22398	39	1	7	1	7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!”
22399	39	1	8	1	8	Solomon replied to God: “You have shown much loving devotion to my father David, and You have made me king in his place.
22400	39	1	9	1	9	Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
22401	39	1	10	1	10	Now grant me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may lead this people. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
22402	39	1	11	1	11	God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart instead of requesting riches or wealth or glory for yourself or death for your enemies—and since you have not even requested long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern My people over whom I have made you king—
22403	39	1	12	1	12	therefore wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will also give you riches and wealth and honor unlike anything given to the kings before you or after you.”
22404	39	1	13	1	13	So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place in Gibeon before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over Israel.
22405	39	1	14	1	14	Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
22406	39	1	15	1	15	The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.
22407	39	1	16	1	16	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
22408	39	1	17	1	17	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.
22409	39	1	18	2	1	Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
22410	39	2	1	2	2	So he conscripted 70,000 porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors.
22411	39	2	2	2	3	Then Solomon sent word to Hiram king of Tyre: “Do for me as you did for my father David when you sent him cedars to build himself a house to live in.
22412	39	2	3	2	4	Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God to dedicate to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him, for displaying the showbread continuously, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is ordained for Israel forever.
22413	39	2	4	2	5	The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
22414	39	2	5	2	6	But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him? Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?
22415	39	2	6	2	7	Send me, therefore, a craftsman skilled in engraving to work with gold and silver, with bronze and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with my craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.
22416	39	2	7	2	8	Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber there. And indeed, my servants will work with yours
22417	39	2	8	2	9	to prepare for me timber in abundance, because the temple I am building will be great and wonderful.
22418	39	2	9	2	10	I will pay your servants, the woodcutters, 20,000 cors of ground wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of olive oil.”
22419	39	2	10	2	11	Then Hiram king of Tyre wrote a letter in reply to Solomon: “Because the LORD loves His people, He has set you over them as king.”
22420	39	2	11	2	12	And Hiram added: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth! He has given King David a wise son with insight and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
22421	39	2	12	2	13	So now I am sending you Huram-abi, a skillful man endowed with creativity.
22422	39	2	13	2	14	He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father is a man of Tyre. He is skilled in work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple, blue, and crimson yarn, and fine linen. He is experienced in every kind of engraving and can execute any design that is given him. He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, your father David.
22423	39	2	14	2	15	Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised.
22424	39	2	15	2	16	We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need, and we will float them to you as rafts by sea down to Joppa. Then you can take them up to Jerusalem.”
22425	39	2	16	2	17	Solomon numbered all the foreign men in the land of Israel following the census his father David had conducted, and there were found to be 153,600 in all.
22426	39	2	17	2	18	Solomon made 70,000 of them porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors.
22427	39	3	1	3	1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. This was the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
22428	39	3	2	3	2	Solomon began construction on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
22429	39	3	3	3	3	The foundation that Solomon laid for the house of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, according to the old standard.
22430	39	3	4	3	4	The portico at the front, extending across the width of the temple, was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
22431	39	3	5	3	5	He paneled the main room with cypress, which he overlaid with fine gold and decorated with palm trees and chains.
22432	39	3	6	3	6	He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and its gold was from Parvaim.
22433	39	3	7	3	7	He overlaid its beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
22434	39	3	8	3	8	Then he made the Most Holy Place; its length corresponded to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. And he overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.
22435	39	3	9	3	9	The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also overlaid the upper area with gold.
22436	39	3	10	3	10	In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of sculptured work, and he overlaid them with gold.
22437	39	3	11	3	11	The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched the wing of the other cherub.
22438	39	3	12	3	12	The wing of the second cherub also measured five cubits and touched the wall of the temple, while its other wing measured five cubits and touched the wing of the first cherub.
22439	39	3	13	3	13	So the total wingspan of these cherubim was twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main room.
22440	39	3	14	3	14	He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim woven into it.
22441	39	3	15	3	15	In front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits high, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits.
22442	39	3	16	3	16	He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He made a hundred pomegranates and fastened them into the chainwork.
22443	39	3	17	3	17	Then he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. The pillar on the south he named Jachin, and the pillar on the north he named Boaz.
22444	39	4	1	4	1	He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.
22445	39	4	2	4	2	He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits in height, and thirty cubits in circumference.
22446	39	4	3	4	3	Below the rim, figures of oxen encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea.
22447	39	4	4	4	4	The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The Sea rested on them with all their hindquarters toward the center.
22448	39	4	5	4	5	It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold three thousand baths.
22449	39	4	6	4	6	He also made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. The parts of the burnt offering were rinsed in them, but the priests used the Sea for washing.
22450	39	4	7	4	7	He made ten gold lampstands according to their specifications and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
22451	39	4	8	4	8	Additionally, he made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold bowls.
22452	39	4	9	4	9	He made the courtyard of the priests and the large court with its doors, and he overlaid the doors with bronze.
22453	39	4	10	4	10	He put the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.
22454	39	4	11	4	11	Additionally, Huram made the pots, shovels, and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work that he had undertaken for King Solomon in the house of God:
22455	39	4	12	4	12	the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars; the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars;
22456	39	4	13	4	13	the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network covering both the bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars);
22457	39	4	14	4	14	the stands; the basins on the stands;
22458	39	4	15	4	15	the Sea; the twelve oxen underneath the Sea;
22459	39	4	16	4	16	and the pots, shovels, meat forks, and all the other articles. All these objects that Huram-abi made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD were of polished bronze.
22460	39	4	17	4	17	The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zeredah.
22461	39	4	18	4	18	Solomon made all these articles in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.
22462	39	4	19	4	19	Solomon also made all the furnishings for the house of God: the golden altar; the tables on which was placed the Bread of the Presence;
22463	39	4	20	4	20	the lampstands of pure gold and their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;
22464	39	4	21	4	21	the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold—of purest gold;
22465	39	4	22	4	22	the wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, ladles, and censers of purest gold; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place as well as the doors of the main hall.
22466	39	5	1	5	1	So all the work that Solomon had performed for the house of the LORD was completed. Then Solomon brought the consecrated items of his father David—the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.
22467	39	5	2	5	2	At that time Solomon assembled in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David.
22468	39	5	3	5	3	So all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month.
22469	39	5	4	5	4	When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,
22470	39	5	5	5	5	and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. The Levitical priests carried them up.
22471	39	5	6	5	6	There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
22472	39	5	7	5	7	Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
22473	39	5	8	5	8	For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles.
22474	39	5	9	5	9	The poles of the ark extended far enough that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day.
22475	39	5	10	5	10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt.
22476	39	5	11	5	11	Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the priests came out of the Holy Place,
22477	39	5	12	5	12	all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
22478	39	5	13	5	13	The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice. They lifted up their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD: “For He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.” Then the temple, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud
22479	39	5	14	5	14	so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
22480	39	6	1	6	1	Then Solomon said: “The LORD said that He would dwell in the thick cloud;
22481	39	6	2	6	2	and I have built You an exalted house, a place for You to dwell forever.”
22482	39	6	3	6	3	And as the whole assembly of Israel stood there, the king turned around and blessed them all
22483	39	6	4	6	4	and said: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying,
22484	39	6	5	6	5	‘Since the day I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house so that My Name would be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over My people Israel.
22485	39	6	6	6	6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem for My Name to be there, and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’
22486	39	6	7	6	7	Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
22487	39	6	8	6	8	But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart.
22488	39	6	9	6	9	Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own offspring, will build the house for My Name.’
22489	39	6	10	6	10	Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
22490	39	6	11	6	11	And there I have provided a place for the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with the children of Israel.”
22491	39	6	12	6	12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
22492	39	6	13	6	13	Now Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had placed it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on it, knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven,
22493	39	6	14	6	14	and said: “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.
22494	39	6	15	6	15	You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.
22495	39	6	16	6	16	Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.’
22496	39	6	17	6	17	And now, O LORD, God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant David.
22497	39	6	18	6	18	But will God indeed dwell with man upon the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built.
22498	39	6	19	6	19	Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You.
22499	39	6	20	6	20	May Your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your Name, so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.
22500	39	6	21	6	21	Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive.
22501	39	6	22	6	22	When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
22502	39	6	23	6	23	then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
22503	39	6	24	6	24	When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading before You in this temple,
22504	39	6	25	6	25	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to them and their fathers.
22505	39	6	26	6	26	When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them,
22506	39	6	27	6	27	then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
22507	39	6	28	6	28	When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies besiege them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come,
22508	39	6	29	6	29	may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make—each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple—
22509	39	6	30	6	30	be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of men—
22510	39	6	31	6	31	so that they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers.
22511	39	6	32	6	32	And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
22512	39	6	33	6	33	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name.
22513	39	6	34	6	34	When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to You in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name,
22514	39	6	35	6	35	then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause.
22515	39	6	36	6	36	When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to a land far or near,
22516	39	6	37	6	37	and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’
22517	39	6	38	6	38	and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name,
22518	39	6	39	6	39	then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause. May You forgive Your people who sinned against You.
22519	39	6	40	6	40	Now, my God, may Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
22520	39	6	41	6	41	Now therefore, arise, O LORD God, and enter Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might. May Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and may Your godly ones rejoice in goodness.
22521	39	6	42	6	42	O LORD God, do not reject Your anointed one. Remember Your loving devotion to Your servant David.”
22522	39	7	1	7	1	When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
22523	39	7	2	7	2	The priests were unable to enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled it.
22524	39	7	3	7	3	When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD: “For He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.”
22525	39	7	4	7	4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
22526	39	7	5	7	5	And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
22527	39	7	6	7	6	The priests stood at their posts, as did the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD and with which David had offered praise, saying, “For His loving devotion endures forever.” Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.
22528	39	7	7	7	7	Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar he had made could not contain all these offerings.
22529	39	7	8	7	8	So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a very great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast for seven days.
22530	39	7	9	7	9	On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar had lasted seven days, and the feast seven days more.
22531	39	7	10	7	10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel.
22532	39	7	11	7	11	When Solomon had finished the house of the LORD and the royal palace, successfully carrying out all that was in his heart to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace,
22533	39	7	12	7	12	the LORD appeared to him at night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.
22534	39	7	13	7	13	If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send a plague among My people,
22535	39	7	14	7	14	and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
22536	39	7	15	7	15	Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
22537	39	7	16	7	16	For I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that My Name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart will be there for all time.
22538	39	7	17	7	17	And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
22539	39	7	18	7	18	then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.’
22540	39	7	19	7	19	But if you turn away and forsake the statutes and the commandments I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods,
22541	39	7	20	7	20	then I will uproot Israel from the soil I have given them, and this temple that I have sanctified for My Name I will banish from My presence. I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.
22542	39	7	21	7	21	And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
22543	39	7	22	7	22	And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, He has brought all this disaster upon them.’”
22544	39	8	1	8	1	Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,
22545	39	8	2	8	2	Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram had given him and settled Israelites there.
22546	39	8	3	8	3	Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it.
22547	39	8	4	8	4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all the store cities that he had built in Hamath.
22548	39	8	5	8	5	He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
22549	39	8	6	8	6	as well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and all the cities for his chariots and horses—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
22550	39	8	7	8	7	As for all the people who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—
22551	39	8	8	8	8	their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy—Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
22552	39	8	9	8	9	But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slave labor, because they were his men of war, his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
22553	39	8	10	8	10	They were also the chief officers for King Solomon: 250 supervisors.
22554	39	8	11	8	11	Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. For he said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.”
22555	39	8	12	8	12	At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front of the portico.
22556	39	8	13	8	13	He observed the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
22557	39	8	14	8	14	In keeping with the ordinances of his father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement. He also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God.
22558	39	8	15	8	15	They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests or the Levites or any matter concerning the treasuries.
22559	39	8	16	8	16	Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
22560	39	8	17	8	17	Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the coast of Edom.
22561	39	8	18	8	18	So Hiram sent him ships captained by his servants, along with crews of experienced sailors. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and acquired from there 450 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
22562	39	9	1	9	1	Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. So she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind.
22563	39	9	2	9	2	And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain.
22564	39	9	3	9	3	When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,
22565	39	9	4	9	4	the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he offered up at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.
22566	39	9	5	9	5	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true.
22567	39	9	6	9	6	But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You have far exceeded the report I heard.
22568	39	9	7	9	7	How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
22569	39	9	8	9	8	Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.”
22570	39	9	9	9	9	Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
22571	39	9	10	9	10	(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum wood and precious stones.
22572	39	9	11	9	11	The king made the algum wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.)
22573	39	9	12	9	12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.
22574	39	9	13	9	13	The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents,
22575	39	9	14	9	14	not including the revenue from the merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
22576	39	9	15	9	15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
22577	39	9	16	9	16	He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
22578	39	9	17	9	17	Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
22579	39	9	18	9	18	The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.
22580	39	9	19	9	19	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
22581	39	9	20	9	20	All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
22582	39	9	21	9	21	For the king had the ships of Tarshish that went with Hiram’s servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
22583	39	9	22	9	22	So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
22584	39	9	23	9	23	All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
22585	39	9	24	9	24	Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
22586	39	9	25	9	25	Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
22587	39	9	26	9	26	He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
22588	39	9	27	9	27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.
22589	39	9	28	9	28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all the lands.
22590	39	9	29	9	29	As for the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
22591	39	9	30	9	30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
22592	39	9	31	9	31	And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
22593	39	10	1	10	1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king.
22594	39	10	2	10	2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon.
22595	39	10	3	10	3	So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
22596	39	10	4	10	4	“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
22597	39	10	5	10	5	Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed.
22598	39	10	6	10	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked.
22599	39	10	7	10	7	They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
22600	39	10	8	10	8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him.
22601	39	10	9	10	9	He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
22602	39	10	10	10	10	The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!
22603	39	10	11	10	11	Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’”
22604	39	10	12	10	12	After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.”
22605	39	10	13	10	13	And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders
22606	39	10	14	10	14	and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to it. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.”
22607	39	10	15	10	15	So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from God, in order that the LORD might fulfill the word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
22608	39	10	16	10	16	When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered the king: “What portion do we have in David, and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, O David!” So all the Israelites went home,
22609	39	10	17	10	17	but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.
22610	39	10	18	10	18	Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem.
22611	39	10	19	10	19	So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.
22612	39	11	1	11	1	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 choice warriors—to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
22613	39	11	2	11	2	But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
22614	39	11	3	11	3	“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin
22615	39	11	4	11	4	that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return home, for this word is from Me.’” So they listened to the words of the LORD and turned back from going against Jeroboam.
22616	39	11	5	11	5	Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem, and he built up cities for defense in Judah.
22617	39	11	6	11	6	He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
22618	39	11	7	11	7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
22619	39	11	8	11	8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
22620	39	11	9	11	9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
22621	39	11	10	11	10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
22622	39	11	11	11	11	He strengthened their fortresses and put officers in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine.
22623	39	11	12	11	12	He also put shields and spears in all the cities and strengthened them greatly. So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
22624	39	11	13	11	13	Moreover, the priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel stood with Rehoboam.
22625	39	11	14	11	14	For the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD.
22626	39	11	15	11	15	And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat-demons and calf idols he had made.
22627	39	11	16	11	16	Those from every tribe of Israel who had set their hearts to seek the LORD their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
22628	39	11	17	11	17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
22629	39	11	18	11	18	And Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
22630	39	11	19	11	19	She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
22631	39	11	20	11	20	After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
22632	39	11	21	11	21	Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
22633	39	11	22	11	22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king.
22634	39	11	23	11	23	Rehoboam also acted wisely by dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them.
22635	39	12	1	12	1	After Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he and all Israel with him forsook the Law of the LORD.
22636	39	12	2	12	2	In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem
22637	39	12	3	12	3	with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and countless troops who came with him out of Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.
22638	39	12	4	12	4	He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
22639	39	12	5	12	5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You have forsaken Me; therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.’”
22640	39	12	6	12	6	So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is righteous.”
22641	39	12	7	12	7	When the LORD saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but will soon grant them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
22642	39	12	8	12	8	Nevertheless, they will become his servants, so that they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the kings of other lands.”
22643	39	12	9	12	9	So King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made.
22644	39	12	10	12	10	Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
22645	39	12	11	12	11	And whenever the king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would go with him, bearing the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom.
22646	39	12	12	12	12	Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of the LORD turned away from him, and He did not destroy him completely. Indeed, conditions were good in Judah.
22647	39	12	13	12	13	Thus King Rehoboam established himself in Jerusalem. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
22648	39	12	14	12	14	And Rehoboam did evil because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
22649	39	12	15	12	15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer concerning the genealogies? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days.
22650	39	12	16	12	16	And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Abijah reigned in his place.
22651	39	13	1	13	1	In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s reign, Abijah became king of Judah,
22652	39	13	2	13	2	and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; she was from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
22653	39	13	3	13	3	Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 choice men, while Jeroboam drew up in formation against him with 800,000 choice and mighty men of valor.
22654	39	13	4	13	4	Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!
22655	39	13	5	13	5	Do you not know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
22656	39	13	6	13	6	Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master.
22657	39	13	7	13	7	Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young, inexperienced, and unable to resist them.
22658	39	13	8	13	8	And now you think you can resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army, and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
22659	39	13	9	13	9	But did you not drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And did you not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands? Now whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of things that are not gods.
22660	39	13	10	13	10	But as for us, the LORD is our God. We have not forsaken Him; the priests who minister to the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties.
22661	39	13	11	13	11	Every morning and every evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table, and every evening they light the lamps of the gold lampstand. We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God, while you have forsaken Him.
22662	39	13	12	13	12	Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.”
22663	39	13	13	13	13	Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to ambush from the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them.
22664	39	13	14	13	14	When Judah turned and discovered that the battle was both before and behind them, they cried out to the LORD. Then the priests blew the trumpets,
22665	39	13	15	13	15	and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. And when they raised the cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
22666	39	13	16	13	16	So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.
22667	39	13	17	13	17	Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow, and 500,000 choice men of Israel fell slain.
22668	39	13	18	13	18	Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.
22669	39	13	19	13	19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their villages.
22670	39	13	20	13	20	Jeroboam did not again recover his power during the days of Abijah, and the LORD struck him down and he died.
22671	39	13	21	13	21	But Abijah grew strong, married fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
22672	39	13	22	13	22	Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, along with his ways and his sayings, are written in the Treatise of the Prophet Iddo.
22673	39	13	23	14	1	Then Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Asa reigned in his place, and in his days the land was at peace for ten years.
22674	39	14	1	14	2	And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
22675	39	14	2	14	3	He removed the foreign altars and high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and chopped down the Asherah poles.
22676	39	14	3	14	4	He commanded the people of Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandments.
22677	39	14	4	14	5	He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and under him the kingdom was at peace.
22678	39	14	5	14	6	Because the land was at peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah. In those days no one made war with him, because the LORD had given him rest.
22679	39	14	6	14	7	So he said to the people of Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought Him and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.
22680	39	14	7	14	8	Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin bearing small shields and drawing the bow. All these were mighty men of valor.
22681	39	14	8	14	9	Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots, and they advanced as far as Mareshah.
22682	39	14	9	14	10	So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
22683	39	14	10	14	11	Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God: “O LORD, there is no one besides You to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God. Do not let a mere mortal prevail against You.”
22684	39	14	11	14	12	So the LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah, and the Cushites fled.
22685	39	14	12	14	13	Then Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell and could not recover, for they were crushed before the LORD and His army. So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder
22686	39	14	13	14	14	and attacked all the cities around Gerar, because the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They plundered all the cities, since there was much plunder there.
22687	39	14	14	14	15	They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and carried off many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
22688	39	15	1	15	1	Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.
22689	39	15	2	15	2	So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.
22690	39	15	3	15	3	For many years Israel has been without the true God, without a priest to instruct them, and without the law.
22691	39	15	4	15	4	But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought Him, and He was found by them.
22692	39	15	5	15	5	In those days there was no safety for travelers, because the residents of the lands had many conflicts.
22693	39	15	6	15	6	Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for God afflicted them with all kinds of adversity.
22694	39	15	7	15	7	But as for you, be strong; do not be discouraged, for your work will be rewarded.”
22695	39	15	8	15	8	When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD’s temple.
22696	39	15	9	15	9	And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin, along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them, for great numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
22697	39	15	10	15	10	So they gathered together in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.
22698	39	15	11	15	11	At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep from all the plunder they had brought back.
22699	39	15	12	15	12	Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul.
22700	39	15	13	15	13	And whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, would be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
22701	39	15	14	15	14	They took an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting, trumpets, and rams’ horns.
22702	39	15	15	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their heart. They had sought Him earnestly, and He was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
22703	39	15	16	15	16	King Asa also removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
22704	39	15	17	15	17	The high places were not removed from Israel, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted all his days.
22705	39	15	18	15	18	And he brought into the house of God the silver and gold articles that he and his father had dedicated.
22706	39	15	19	15	19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
22707	39	16	1	16	1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
22708	39	16	2	16	2	So Asa withdrew the silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he sent it with this message to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus:
22709	39	16	3	16	3	“Let there be a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”
22710	39	16	4	16	4	And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
22711	39	16	5	16	5	When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work.
22712	39	16	6	16	6	Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials he built up Geba and Mizpah.
22713	39	16	7	16	7	At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and told him, “Because you have relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
22714	39	16	8	16	8	Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand.
22715	39	16	9	16	9	For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is fully devoted to Him. You have acted foolishly in this matter. From now on, therefore, you will be at war.”
22716	39	16	10	16	10	Asa was angry with the seer and became so enraged over this matter that he put the man in prison. And at the same time Asa oppressed some of the people.
22717	39	16	11	16	11	Now the rest of the acts of Asa, from beginning to end, are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
22718	39	16	12	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady became increasingly severe. Yet even in his illness he did not seek the LORD, but only the physicians.
22719	39	16	13	16	13	So in the forty-first year of his reign, Asa died and rested with his fathers.
22720	39	16	14	16	14	And he was buried in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier that was full of spices and various blended perfumes; then they made a great fire in his honor.
22721	39	17	1	17	1	Asa’s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.
22722	39	17	2	17	2	He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
22723	39	17	3	17	3	Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals,
22724	39	17	4	17	4	but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel.
22725	39	17	5	17	5	So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.
22726	39	17	6	17	6	And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
22727	39	17	7	17	7	In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,
22728	39	17	8	17	8	accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
22729	39	17	9	17	9	They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.
22730	39	17	10	17	10	And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
22731	39	17	11	17	11	Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.
22732	39	17	12	17	12	Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah
22733	39	17	13	17	13	and kept a large amount of supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of valor.
22734	39	17	14	17	14	These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: From Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor;
22735	39	17	15	17	15	next to him, Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000;
22736	39	17	16	17	16	and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor.
22737	39	17	17	17	17	From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him 200,000 armed with bows and shields;
22738	39	17	18	17	18	and next to him, Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed for battle.
22739	39	17	19	17	19	These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
22740	39	18	1	18	1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.
22741	39	18	2	18	2	And some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria, where Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him, and urged him to march up to Ramoth-gilead.
22742	39	18	3	18	3	Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat replied, “I am like you, and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.”
22743	39	18	4	18	4	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
22744	39	18	5	18	5	So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” “Go up,” they replied, “and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
22745	39	18	6	18	6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?”
22746	39	18	7	18	7	The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” “The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
22747	39	18	8	18	8	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
22748	39	18	9	18	9	Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
22749	39	18	10	18	10	Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’”
22750	39	18	11	18	11	And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
22751	39	18	12	18	12	Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
22752	39	18	13	18	13	But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me.”
22753	39	18	14	18	14	When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” “Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for they will be given into your hand.”
22754	39	18	15	18	15	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
22755	39	18	16	18	16	So Micaiah declared: “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master; let each one return home in peace.’”
22756	39	18	17	18	17	Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
22757	39	18	18	18	18	Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
22758	39	18	19	18	19	And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one suggested this, and another that.
22759	39	18	20	18	20	Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ ‘By what means?’ asked the LORD.
22760	39	18	21	18	21	And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ ‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’
22761	39	18	22	18	22	So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
22762	39	18	23	18	23	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
22763	39	18	24	18	24	Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
22764	39	18	25	18	25	And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
22765	39	18	26	18	26	and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’”
22766	39	18	27	18	27	But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!”
22767	39	18	28	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
22768	39	18	29	18	29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
22769	39	18	30	18	30	Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
22770	39	18	31	18	31	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “This is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him.
22771	39	18	32	18	32	And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
22772	39	18	33	18	33	However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
22773	39	18	34	18	34	The battle raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. And at sunset he died.
22774	39	19	1	19	1	Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his home in Jerusalem.
22775	39	19	2	19	2	Then Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to confront him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Do you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you.
22776	39	19	3	19	3	However, some good is found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land and have set your heart on seeking God.”
22777	39	19	4	19	4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once again he went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
22778	39	19	5	19	5	He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
22779	39	19	6	19	6	Then he said to the judges, “Consider carefully what you do, for you are not judging for man, but for the LORD, who is with you when you render judgment.
22780	39	19	7	19	7	And now, may the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.”
22781	39	19	8	19	8	In Jerusalem Jehoshaphat also appointed some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families to judge on behalf of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.
22782	39	19	9	19	9	He commanded them, saying, “You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.
22783	39	19	10	19	10	For every dispute that comes before you from your brothers who dwell in their cities—whether it regards bloodshed or some other violation of law, commandments, statutes, or ordinances—you are to warn them, so that they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come upon you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt.
22784	39	19	11	19	11	Note that Amariah, the chief priest, will be over you in all that pertains to the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers before you. Act resolutely; may the LORD be with the upright!”
22785	39	20	1	20	1	After this, the Moabites and Ammonites, together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat.
22786	39	20	2	20	2	Then some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the Sea; they are already in Hazazon-tamar” (that is, En-gedi).
22787	39	20	3	20	3	Jehoshaphat was alarmed and set his face to seek the LORD. And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.
22788	39	20	4	20	4	So the people of Judah gathered to seek the LORD, and indeed, they came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him.
22789	39	20	5	20	5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD in front of the new courtyard
22790	39	20	6	20	6	and said, “O LORD, God of our fathers, are You not the God who is in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand, and no one can stand against You.
22791	39	20	7	20	7	Our God, did You not drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend?
22792	39	20	8	20	8	They have lived in the land and have built in it a sanctuary for Your Name, saying,
22793	39	20	9	20	9	‘If disaster comes upon us—whether sword or judgment, plague or famine—we will stand before this temple and before You, for Your Name is in this temple. We will cry out to You in our distress, and You will hear us and save us.’
22794	39	20	10	20	10	And now, here are the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt; but Israel turned away from them and did not destroy them.
22795	39	20	11	20	11	See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession that You gave us as an inheritance.
22796	39	20	12	20	12	Our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless before this vast army that comes against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”
22797	39	20	13	20	13	Meanwhile all the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, were standing before the LORD.
22798	39	20	14	20	14	Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from Asaph’s descendants, as he stood in the midst of the assembly.
22799	39	20	15	20	15	And he said, “Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army, for the battle does not belong to you, but to God.
22800	39	20	16	20	16	Tomorrow you are to march down against them. You will see them coming up the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the Wilderness of Jeruel.
22801	39	20	17	20	17	You need not fight this battle. Take up your positions, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out and face them tomorrow, for the LORD is with you.’”
22802	39	20	18	20	18	Then Jehoshaphat bowed facedown, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down before the LORD to worship Him.
22803	39	20	19	20	19	And the Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, shouting in a very loud voice.
22804	39	20	20	20	20	Early in the morning they got up and left for the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, “Hear me, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be upheld; believe in His prophets, and you will succeed.”
22805	39	20	21	20	21	Then Jehoshaphat consulted with the people and appointed those who would sing to the LORD and praise the splendor of His holiness. As they went out before the army, they were singing: “Give thanks to the LORD, for His loving devotion endures forever.”
22806	39	20	22	20	22	The moment they began their shouts and praises, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir who had come against Judah, and they were defeated.
22807	39	20	23	20	23	The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction. And when they had made an end to the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
22808	39	20	24	20	24	When the men of Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked for the vast army, but there were only corpses lying on the ground; no one had escaped.
22809	39	20	25	20	25	Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to carry off the plunder, and they found on the bodies an abundance of goods and valuables—more than they could carry away. They were gathering the plunder for three days because there was so much.
22810	39	20	26	20	26	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they blessed the LORD. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
22811	39	20	27	20	27	Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
22812	39	20	28	20	28	So they entered Jerusalem and went into the house of the LORD with harps, lyres, and trumpets.
22813	39	20	29	20	29	And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
22814	39	20	30	20	30	Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
22815	39	20	31	20	31	So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
22816	39	20	32	20	32	And Jehoshaphat walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn away from it; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
22817	39	20	33	20	33	The high places, however, were not removed; the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their fathers.
22818	39	20	34	20	34	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
22819	39	20	35	20	35	Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly.
22820	39	20	36	20	36	They agreed to make ships to go to Tarshish, and these were built in Ezion-geber.
22821	39	20	37	20	37	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” So the ships were wrecked and were unable to sail to Tarshish.
22822	39	21	1	21	1	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Jehoram reigned in his place.
22823	39	21	2	21	2	Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; these were all sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
22824	39	21	3	21	3	Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, as well as the fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
22825	39	21	4	21	4	When Jehoram had established himself over his father’s kingdom, he strengthened himself by putting to the sword all his brothers along with some of the princes of Israel.
22826	39	21	5	21	5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
22827	39	21	6	21	6	And Jehoram walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD.
22828	39	21	7	21	7	Yet the LORD was unwilling to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant He had made with David, and since He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
22829	39	21	8	21	8	In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king.
22830	39	21	9	21	9	So Jehoram crossed into Edom with his officers and all his chariots. When the Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked by night.
22831	39	21	10	21	10	So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled against his rule at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.
22832	39	21	11	21	11	Jehoram had also built high places on the hills of Judah; he had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.
22833	39	21	12	21	12	Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah the prophet, which stated: “This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah,
22834	39	21	13	21	13	but you have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab prostituted itself. You have also killed your brothers, your father’s family, who were better than you.
22835	39	21	14	21	14	So behold, the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a serious blow.
22836	39	21	15	21	15	And day after day you yourself will suffer from a severe illness, a disease of your bowels, until it causes your bowels to come out.’”
22837	39	21	16	21	16	Then the LORD stirred against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
22838	39	21	17	21	17	So they went to war against Judah, invaded it, and carried off all the possessions found in the king’s palace, along with his sons and wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest.
22839	39	21	18	21	18	After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels.
22840	39	21	19	21	19	This continued day after day until two full years had passed. Finally, his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died in severe pain. And his people did not make a fire in his honor as they had done for his fathers.
22841	39	21	20	21	20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He died, to no one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
22842	39	22	1	22	1	Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram, king in his place, since the raiders who had come into the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
22843	39	22	2	22	2	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
22844	39	22	3	22	3	Ahaziah also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in wickedness.
22845	39	22	4	22	4	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for to his destruction they were his counselors after the death of his father.
22846	39	22	5	22	5	Ahaziah also followed their counsel and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram;
22847	39	22	6	22	6	so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded.
22848	39	22	7	22	7	Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he went to visit Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
22849	39	22	8	22	8	So while Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them.
22850	39	22	9	22	9	Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s soldiers captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. So Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.” So no one was left from the house of Ahaziah with the strength to rule the kingdom.
22851	39	22	10	22	10	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah.
22852	39	22	11	22	11	But Jehoshabeath daughter of King Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him.
22853	39	22	12	22	12	And Joash remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
22854	39	23	1	23	1	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds—with Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri.
22855	39	23	2	23	2	So they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the families of Israel. And when they came to Jerusalem,
22856	39	23	3	23	3	the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. “Behold, the king’s son!” said Jehoiada. “He must reign, just as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.
22857	39	23	4	23	4	This is what you are to do: A third of you priests and Levites who come on duty on the Sabbath shall keep watch at the doors,
22858	39	23	5	23	5	a third shall be at the royal palace, and a third at the Foundation Gate, while all the others are in the courtyards of the house of the LORD.
22859	39	23	6	23	6	No one is to enter the house of the LORD except the priests and those Levites who serve; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the people are to obey the requirement of the LORD.
22860	39	23	7	23	7	The Levites must surround the king with weapons in hand, and anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.”
22861	39	23	8	23	8	So the Levites and all Judah did everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
22862	39	23	9	23	9	Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields of King David that were in the house of God.
22863	39	23	10	23	10	He stationed all the troops, with their weapons in hand, surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
22864	39	23	11	23	11	Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live the king!”
22865	39	23	12	23	12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went out to them in the house of the LORD.
22866	39	23	13	23	13	And she looked out and saw the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, while the singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Treason, treason!”
22867	39	23	14	23	14	And Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, saying, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
22868	39	23	15	23	15	So they seized Athaliah as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate to the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.
22869	39	23	16	23	16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s people.
22870	39	23	17	23	17	So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols into pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
22871	39	23	18	23	18	Moreover, Jehoiada put the oversight of the house of the LORD into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom David had appointed over the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD as is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and song, as ordained by David.
22872	39	23	19	23	19	He stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, so that nothing unclean could enter for any reason.
22873	39	23	20	23	20	He also took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate. They seated King Joash on the royal throne,
22874	39	23	21	23	21	and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been put to the sword.
22875	39	24	1	24	1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
22876	39	24	2	24	2	And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
22877	39	24	3	24	3	Jehoiada took for himself two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
22878	39	24	4	24	4	Some time later, Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the LORD.
22879	39	24	5	24	5	So he gathered the priests and Levites and said, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the house of your God. Do it quickly.” The Levites, however, did not make haste.
22880	39	24	6	24	6	So the king called Jehoiada the high priest and said, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?”
22881	39	24	7	24	7	For the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the house of God and had even used the sacred objects of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
22882	39	24	8	24	8	At the king’s command a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the house of the LORD.
22883	39	24	9	24	9	And a proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they were to bring to the LORD the tax imposed by Moses the servant of God on Israel in the wilderness.
22884	39	24	10	24	10	All the officers and all the people rejoiced and brought their contributions, and they dropped them in the chest until it was full.
22885	39	24	11	24	11	Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s overseers and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this daily and gathered the money in abundance.
22886	39	24	12	24	12	Then the king and Jehoiada would give the money to those who supervised the labor on the house of the LORD to hire stonecutters and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, as well as workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
22887	39	24	13	24	13	So the workmen labored, and in their hands the repair work progressed. They restored the house of God according to its specifications, and they reinforced it.
22888	39	24	14	24	14	When they were finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada to make with it the articles for the house of the LORD—utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings, dishes, and other objects of gold and silver. Throughout the days of Jehoiada, burnt offerings were presented regularly in the house of the LORD.
22889	39	24	15	24	15	When Jehoiada was old and full of years, he died at the age of 130.
22890	39	24	16	24	16	And Jehoiada was buried with the kings in the City of David, because he had done what was good in Israel for God and His temple.
22891	39	24	17	24	17	After the death of Jehoiada, however, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.
22892	39	24	18	24	18	They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and idols. So wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
22893	39	24	19	24	19	Nevertheless, the LORD sent prophets to bring the people back to Him and to testify against them; but they would not listen.
22894	39	24	20	24	20	Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood up before the people and said to them, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, He has forsaken you.’”
22895	39	24	21	24	21	But they conspired against Zechariah, and by order of the king, they stoned him in the courtyard of the house of the LORD.
22896	39	24	22	24	22	Thus King Joash failed to remember the kindness that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him. Instead, Joash killed Jehoiada’s son. As he lay dying, Zechariah said, “May the LORD see this and call you to account.”
22897	39	24	23	24	23	In the spring, the army of Aram went to war against Joash. They entered Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the leaders of the people, and they sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
22898	39	24	24	24	24	Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.
22899	39	24	25	24	25	And when the Arameans had withdrawn, they left Joash severely wounded. His own servants conspired against him for shedding the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him on his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
22900	39	24	26	24	26	Those who conspired against Joash were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
22901	39	24	27	24	27	The accounts of the sons of Joash, as well as the many pronouncements about him and about the restoration of the house of God, are indeed written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah reigned in his place.
22902	39	25	1	25	1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
22903	39	25	2	25	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly.
22904	39	25	3	25	3	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king.
22905	39	25	4	25	4	Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.”
22906	39	25	5	25	5	Then Amaziah gathered the people of Judah and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and of hundreds. And he numbered those twenty years of age or older throughout Judah and Benjamin and found 300,000 choice men able to serve in the army, bearing the spear and shield.
22907	39	25	6	25	6	He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
22908	39	25	7	25	7	But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the Ephraimites.
22909	39	25	8	25	8	Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has power to help and power to overthrow.”
22910	39	25	9	25	9	Amaziah asked the man of God, “What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of Israel?” And the man of God replied, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”
22911	39	25	10	25	10	So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. And they were furious with Judah and returned home in great anger.
22912	39	25	11	25	11	Amaziah, however, summoned his strength and led his troops to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir,
22913	39	25	12	25	12	and the army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
22914	39	25	13	25	13	Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had dismissed from battle raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon. They struck down 3,000 people and carried off a great deal of plunder.
22915	39	25	14	25	14	When Amaziah returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the Seirites, set them up as his own gods, bowed before them, and burned sacrifices to them.
22916	39	25	15	25	15	Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet, who said, “Why have you sought this people’s gods, which could not deliver them from your hand?”
22917	39	25	16	25	16	While he was still speaking, the king asked, “Have we made you the counselor to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?” So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”
22918	39	25	17	25	17	Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent word to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said.
22919	39	25	18	25	18	But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
22920	39	25	19	25	19	You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’ and your heart has become proud and boastful. Now stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”
22921	39	25	20	25	20	But Amaziah would not listen, for this had come from God in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
22922	39	25	21	25	21	So Jehoash king of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
22923	39	25	22	25	22	And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his own home.
22924	39	25	23	25	23	There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits.
22925	39	25	24	25	24	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
22926	39	25	25	25	25	Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
22927	39	25	26	25	26	As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
22928	39	25	27	25	27	From the time that Amaziah turned from following the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.
22929	39	25	28	25	28	They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
22930	39	26	1	26	1	All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
22931	39	26	2	26	2	Uzziah was the one who rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.
22932	39	26	3	26	3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
22933	39	26	4	26	4	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
22934	39	26	5	26	5	He sought God throughout the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. And as long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.
22935	39	26	6	26	6	Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines, and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines.
22936	39	26	7	26	7	God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunites.
22937	39	26	8	26	8	The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, for he had become exceedingly powerful.
22938	39	26	9	26	9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle in the wall, and he fortified them.
22939	39	26	10	26	10	Since he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns. And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields.
22940	39	26	11	26	11	Uzziah had an army ready for battle that went out to war by assigned divisions, as recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officers.
22941	39	26	12	26	12	The total number of family leaders of the mighty men of valor was 2,600.
22942	39	26	13	26	13	Under their authority was an army of 307,500 trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.
22943	39	26	14	26	14	Uzziah supplied the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones.
22944	39	26	15	26	15	And in Jerusalem he made skillfully designed devices to shoot arrows and catapult large stones from the towers and corners. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped until he became powerful.
22945	39	26	16	26	16	But when Uzziah grew powerful, his arrogance led to his own destruction. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
22946	39	26	17	26	17	Then Azariah the priest, along with eighty brave priests of the LORD, went in after him.
22947	39	26	18	26	18	They took their stand against King Uzziah and said, “Uzziah, you have no right to offer incense to the LORD. Only the priests, the descendants of Aaron, are consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully; you will not receive honor from the LORD God.”
22948	39	26	19	26	19	Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But while he raged against the priests in their presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead.
22949	39	26	20	26	20	When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw his leprous forehead, they rushed him out. Indeed, he himself hurried to get out, because the LORD had afflicted him.
22950	39	26	21	26	21	So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He lived in isolation, leprous and cut off from the house of the LORD, while his son Jotham had charge of the royal palace to govern the people of the land.
22951	39	26	22	26	22	As for the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
22952	39	26	23	26	23	And Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field of burial that belonged to the kings; for the people said, “He was a leper.” And his son Jotham reigned in his place.
22953	39	27	1	27	1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother’s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
22954	39	27	2	27	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved corruptly.
22955	39	27	3	27	3	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
22956	39	27	4	27	4	He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
22957	39	27	5	27	5	Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years.
22958	39	27	6	27	6	So Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
22959	39	27	7	27	7	As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
22960	39	27	8	27	8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
22961	39	27	9	27	9	And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.
22962	39	28	1	28	1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
22963	39	28	2	28	2	Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made cast images of the Baals.
22964	39	28	3	28	3	Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
22965	39	28	4	28	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
22966	39	28	5	28	5	So the LORD his God delivered Ahaz into the hand of the king of Aram, who attacked him and took many captives to Damascus. Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force.
22967	39	28	6	28	6	For in one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant men in Judah. This happened because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
22968	39	28	7	28	7	Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah the second to the king.
22969	39	28	8	28	8	Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their kinsmen—women, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a great deal of plunder and brought it to Samaria.
22970	39	28	9	28	9	But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army that returned to Samaria. “Look,” he said to them, “because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hands. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.
22971	39	28	10	28	10	And now you intend to reduce to slavery the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem. But are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
22972	39	28	11	28	11	Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives you took from your kinsmen, for the fierce anger of the LORD is upon you.”
22973	39	28	12	28	12	Then some of the leaders of the Ephraimites—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood in opposition to those arriving from the war.
22974	39	28	13	28	13	“You must not bring the captives here,” they said, “for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us from the LORD and to add to our sins and our guilt. For our guilt is great, and fierce anger is upon Israel.”
22975	39	28	14	28	14	So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly.
22976	39	28	15	28	15	Then the men who were designated by name arose, took charge of the captives, and provided from the plunder clothing for the naked. They clothed them, gave them sandals and food and drink, anointed their wounds, and put all the feeble on donkeys. So they brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.
22977	39	28	16	28	16	At that time King Ahaz sent for help from the king of Assyria.
22978	39	28	17	28	17	The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away captives.
22979	39	28	18	28	18	The Philistines had also raided the cities of the foothills and the Negev of Judah, capturing and occupying Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages.
22980	39	28	19	28	19	For the LORD humbled Judah because Ahaz king of Israel had thrown off restraint in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
22981	39	28	20	28	20	Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came to Ahaz but afflicted him rather than strengthening him.
22982	39	28	21	28	21	Although Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD, from the royal palace, and from the princes and had presented it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.
22983	39	28	22	28	22	In the time of his distress, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.
22984	39	28	23	28	23	Since Damascus had defeated him, he sacrificed to their gods and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But these gods were the downfall of Ahaz and of all Israel.
22985	39	28	24	28	24	Then Ahaz gathered up the articles of the house of God, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the house of the LORD, and set up altars of his own on every street corner in Jerusalem.
22986	39	28	25	28	25	In every city of Judah he built high places to offer incense to other gods, and so he provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers.
22987	39	28	26	28	26	As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz and all his ways, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
22988	39	28	27	28	27	And Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
22989	39	29	1	29	1	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
22990	39	29	2	29	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.
22991	39	29	3	29	3	In the first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of the LORD.
22992	39	29	4	29	4	Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the square on the east side.
22993	39	29	5	29	5	“Listen to me, O Levites,” he said. “Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove from the Holy Place every impurity.
22994	39	29	6	29	6	For our fathers were unfaithful and did evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs on Him.
22995	39	29	7	29	7	They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn incense or present burnt offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel.
22996	39	29	8	29	8	Therefore, the wrath of the LORD has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery, as you can see with your own eyes.
22997	39	29	9	29	9	For behold, this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity.
22998	39	29	10	29	10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that His fierce anger will turn away from us.
22999	39	29	11	29	11	Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, to minister before Him, and to burn incense.”
23000	39	29	12	29	12	Then the Levites set to work: Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
23001	39	29	13	29	13	Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites; Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
23002	39	29	14	29	14	Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites; and Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
23003	39	29	15	29	15	When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to cleanse the house of the LORD, according to the command of the king by the words of the LORD.
23004	39	29	16	29	16	So the priests went inside the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out to the courtyard all the unclean things that they found in the temple of the LORD. Then the Levites took these things and carried them out to the Kidron Valley.
23005	39	29	17	29	17	They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the house of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
23006	39	29	18	29	18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported, “We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the showbread with all its utensils.
23007	39	29	19	29	19	Moreover, we have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign. They are now in front of the altar of the LORD.”
23008	39	29	20	29	20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went up to the house of the LORD.
23009	39	29	21	29	21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And the king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
23010	39	29	22	29	22	So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
23011	39	29	23	29	23	Then they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them.
23012	39	29	24	29	24	And the priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
23013	39	29	25	29	25	Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet. For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets.
23014	39	29	26	29	26	The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
23015	39	29	27	29	27	And Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be sacrificed on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
23016	39	29	28	29	28	The whole assembly was worshiping, the singers were singing, and the trumpeters were playing. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed.
23017	39	29	29	29	29	When the offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped.
23018	39	29	30	29	30	Then King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.
23019	39	29	31	29	31	Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.
23020	39	29	32	29	32	The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
23021	39	29	33	29	33	And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
23022	39	29	34	29	34	However, since there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings, their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests had been consecrated. For the Levites had been more diligent in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
23023	39	29	35	29	35	Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the LORD was established.
23024	39	29	36	29	36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had prepared for the people, because everything had been accomplished so quickly.
23025	39	30	1	30	1	Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel.
23026	39	30	2	30	2	For the king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided to keep the Passover in the second month,
23027	39	30	3	30	3	since they had been unable to observe it at the regular time, because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not been gathered in Jerusalem.
23028	39	30	4	30	4	This proposal pleased the king and the whole assembly.
23029	39	30	5	30	5	So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem. For they had not observed it as a nation as prescribed.
23030	39	30	6	30	6	So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials, which read: “Children of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped the grasp of the kings of Assyria.
23031	39	30	7	30	7	Do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that He made them an object of horror, as you can see.
23032	39	30	8	30	8	Now do not stiffen your necks as your fathers did. Submit to the LORD and come to His sanctuary, which He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that His fierce anger will turn away from you.
23033	39	30	9	30	9	For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”
23034	39	30	10	30	10	And the couriers traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun; but the people scorned and mocked them.
23035	39	30	11	30	11	Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
23036	39	30	12	30	12	Moreover, the power of God was on the people in Judah to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and his officials according to the word of the LORD.
23037	39	30	13	30	13	In the second month, a very great assembly gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
23038	39	30	14	30	14	They proceeded to remove the altars in Jerusalem and to take away the incense altars and throw them into the Kidron Valley.
23039	39	30	15	30	15	And on the fourteenth day of the second month they slaughtered the Passover lamb. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
23040	39	30	16	30	16	They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites.
23041	39	30	17	30	17	Since there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the LORD.
23042	39	30	18	30	18	A large number of the people—many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah interceded for them, saying, “May the LORD, who is good, provide atonement for everyone
23043	39	30	19	30	19	who sets his heart on seeking God—the LORD, the God of his fathers—even if he is not cleansed according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”
23044	39	30	20	30	20	And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
23045	39	30	21	30	21	The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the LORD day after day, accompanied by loud instruments of praise to the LORD.
23046	39	30	22	30	22	And Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. For seven days they ate their assigned portion, sacrificing fellowship offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
23047	39	30	23	30	23	The whole assembly agreed to observe seven more days, so they observed seven days with joy.
23048	39	30	24	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah contributed a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly, and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.
23049	39	30	25	30	25	Then the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced along with the priests and Levites and the whole assembly that had come from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah.
23050	39	30	26	30	26	So there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened there since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel.
23051	39	30	27	30	27	Then the priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard their voice, and their prayer came into His holy dwelling place in heaven.
23052	39	31	1	31	1	When all this had ended, the Israelites in attendance went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property.
23053	39	31	2	31	2	Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for singing praises at the gates of the LORD’s dwelling.
23054	39	31	3	31	3	The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, as written in the Law of the LORD.
23055	39	31	4	31	4	Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to make a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
23056	39	31	5	31	5	As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance—a tithe of everything.
23057	39	31	6	31	6	And the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to the LORD their God, and they laid them in large heaps.
23058	39	31	7	31	7	In the third month they began building up the heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.
23059	39	31	8	31	8	When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.
23060	39	31	9	31	9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps,
23061	39	31	10	31	10	and Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, “Since the people began to bring their contributions into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and there is plenty left over, because the LORD has blessed His people; this great abundance is what is left over.”
23062	39	31	11	31	11	Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare storerooms in the house of the LORD, and they did so.
23063	39	31	12	31	12	And they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.
23064	39	31	13	31	13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of the house of God.
23065	39	31	14	31	14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions to the LORD and the consecrated gifts.
23066	39	31	15	31	15	Under his authority, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their fellow priests in their cities, according to their divisions, old and young alike.
23067	39	31	16	31	16	In addition, they distributed portions to the males registered by genealogy who were three years of age or older—to all who would enter the house of the LORD for their daily duties for service in the responsibilities of their divisions—
23068	39	31	17	31	17	and to the priests enrolled according to their families in the genealogy, as well as to the Levites twenty years of age or older, according to their duties and divisions.
23069	39	31	18	31	18	The genealogy included all the little ones, wives, sons, and daughters in the whole assembly. For they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy.
23070	39	31	19	31	19	As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around each of their cities or in any other city, men were designated by name to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed by the genealogies.
23071	39	31	20	31	20	So this is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.
23072	39	31	21	31	21	He was diligent in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and the commandments, in order to seek his God. And so he prospered.
23073	39	32	1	32	1	After all these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself.
23074	39	32	2	32	2	When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to make war against Jerusalem,
23075	39	32	3	32	3	he consulted with his leaders and commanders about stopping up the waters of the springs outside the city, and they helped him carry it out.
23076	39	32	4	32	4	Many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.
23077	39	32	5	32	5	Then Hezekiah worked resolutely to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall and to raise up towers on it. He also built an outer wall and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David, and he produced an abundance of weapons and shields.
23078	39	32	6	32	6	Hezekiah appointed military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying,
23079	39	32	7	32	7	“Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him.
23080	39	32	8	32	8	With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” So the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
23081	39	32	9	32	9	Later, as Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem with a message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem:
23082	39	32	10	32	10	“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: What is the basis of your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
23083	39	32	11	32	11	Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, ‘The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?’
23084	39	32	12	32	12	Did not Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn sacrifices’?
23085	39	32	13	32	13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of these nations ever been able to deliver their land from my hand?
23086	39	32	14	32	14	Who among all the gods of these nations that my fathers devoted to destruction has been able to deliver his people from my hand? How then can your God deliver you from my hand?
23087	39	32	15	32	15	So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, and do not let him mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!”
23088	39	32	16	32	16	And the servants of Sennacherib spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
23089	39	32	17	32	17	He also wrote letters mocking the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying against Him: “Just as the gods of the nations did not deliver their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”
23090	39	32	18	32	18	Then the Assyrians called out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them in order to capture the city.
23091	39	32	19	32	19	They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth—the work of human hands.
23092	39	32	20	32	20	In response, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out to heaven in prayer,
23093	39	32	21	32	21	and the LORD sent an angel who annihilated every mighty man of valor and every leader and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons struck him down with the sword.
23094	39	32	22	32	22	So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria and all the others, and He gave them rest on every side.
23095	39	32	23	32	23	Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah, and from then on he was exalted in the eyes of all nations.
23096	39	32	24	32	24	In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So he prayed to the LORD, who spoke to him and gave him a sign.
23097	39	32	25	32	25	But because his heart was proud, Hezekiah did not repay the favor shown to him. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
23098	39	32	26	32	26	Then Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart—he and the people of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.
23099	39	32	27	32	27	Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles.
23100	39	32	28	32	28	He also made storehouses for the harvest of grain and new wine and oil, stalls for all kinds of livestock, and pens for the flocks.
23101	39	32	29	32	29	He made cities for himself, and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave him very great wealth.
23102	39	32	30	32	30	It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Spring of Gihon and channeled it down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.
23103	39	32	31	32	31	And so when ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, that He might know all that was in Hezekiah’s heart.
23104	39	32	32	32	32	As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of loving devotion, they are indeed written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
23105	39	32	33	32	33	And Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. And his son Manasseh reigned in his place.
23106	39	33	1	33	1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
23107	39	33	2	33	2	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD by following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
23108	39	33	3	33	3	For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down, and he raised up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. And he worshiped and served all the host of heaven.
23109	39	33	4	33	4	Manasseh also built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.”
23110	39	33	5	33	5	In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars to all the host of heaven.
23111	39	33	6	33	6	He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.
23112	39	33	7	33	7	Manasseh even took the carved image he had made and set it up in the house of God, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish My Name forever.
23113	39	33	8	33	8	I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to leave the land that I assigned to your fathers, if only they are careful to do all that I have commanded them through Moses—all the laws, statutes, and judgments.”
23114	39	33	9	33	9	So Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
23115	39	33	10	33	10	And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they did not listen.
23116	39	33	11	33	11	So the LORD brought against them the military commanders of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
23117	39	33	12	33	12	And in his distress, Manasseh sought the favor of the LORD his God and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his fathers.
23118	39	33	13	33	13	And when he prayed to Him, the LORD received his plea and heard his petition; so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.
23119	39	33	14	33	14	After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate, and he brought it around the hill of Ophel and heightened it considerably. He also stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.
23120	39	33	15	33	15	He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, along with all the altars he had built on the temple mount and in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the city.
23121	39	33	16	33	16	Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and he told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
23122	39	33	17	33	17	Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
23123	39	33	18	33	18	As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, they are indeed written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
23124	39	33	19	33	19	His prayer and how God received his plea, as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself, they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers.
23125	39	33	20	33	20	And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried at his palace. And his son Amon reigned in his place.
23126	39	33	21	33	21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
23127	39	33	22	33	22	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon served and sacrificed to all the idols that his father Manasseh had made,
23128	39	33	23	33	23	but he did not humble himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had done; instead, Amon increased his guilt.
23129	39	33	24	33	24	Then the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed him in his palace.
23130	39	33	25	33	25	But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
23131	39	34	1	34	1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
23132	39	34	2	34	2	And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
23133	39	34	3	34	3	In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his father David, and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images.
23134	39	34	4	34	4	Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down, and he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them. He shattered the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images, crushed them to dust, and scattered them over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
23135	39	34	5	34	5	Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars. So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
23136	39	34	6	34	6	Josiah did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them.
23137	39	34	7	34	7	He tore down the altars and Asherah poles, crushed the idols to powder, and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
23138	39	34	8	34	8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, in order to cleanse the land and the temple, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
23139	39	34	9	34	9	So they went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites at the doors had collected from the people of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, Judah, and Benjamin, and from the people of Jerusalem.
23140	39	34	10	34	10	They put it into the hands of the supervisors of those doing the work of the house of the LORD, who in turn gave it to the workmen restoring and repairing the house of the LORD.
23141	39	34	11	34	11	They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to buy dressed stone, as well as timbers for couplings and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to deteriorate.
23142	39	34	12	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully. The Levites overseeing them were Jahath and Obadiah, descendants of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descendants of Kohath. Other Levites, all skilled with musical instruments,
23143	39	34	13	34	13	were over the laborers and supervised all who did the work, task by task. Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.
23144	39	34	14	34	14	While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD written by Moses.
23145	39	34	15	34	15	And Hilkiah said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan.
23146	39	34	16	34	16	Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and reported, “Your servants are doing all that has been placed in their hands.
23147	39	34	17	34	17	They have paid out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have put it into the hands of the supervisors and workers.”
23148	39	34	18	34	18	Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
23149	39	34	19	34	19	When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his clothes
23150	39	34	20	34	20	and commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king:
23151	39	34	21	34	21	“Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for those remaining in Israel and Judah concerning the words in the book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that has been poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD by doing all that is written in this book.”
23152	39	34	22	34	22	So Hilkiah and those the king had designated went and spoke to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
23153	39	34	23	34	23	And Huldah said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you
23154	39	34	24	34	24	that this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people, according to all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah,
23155	39	34	25	34	25	because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. My wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.’
23156	39	34	26	34	26	But as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard,
23157	39	34	27	34	27	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and against its people, and because you have humbled yourself before Me and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the LORD.
23158	39	34	28	34	28	‘Now I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.’” So they brought her answer back to the king.
23159	39	34	29	34	29	Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
23160	39	34	30	34	30	And he went up to the house of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the Levites—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
23161	39	34	31	34	31	So the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book.
23162	39	34	32	34	32	Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin take a stand in agreement to it. So all the people of Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
23163	39	34	33	34	33	And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the Israelites, and he required everyone in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign they did not turn aside from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
23164	39	35	1	35	1	Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.
23165	39	35	2	35	2	He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
23166	39	35	3	35	3	To the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the LORD, Josiah said: “Put the holy ark in the temple built by Solomon son of David king of Israel. It is not to be carried around on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people Israel.
23167	39	35	4	35	4	Prepare yourselves by your families in your divisions, according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and his son Solomon.
23168	39	35	5	35	5	Moreover, stand in the Holy Place by the divisions of the families of your kinsmen the lay people, and by the divisions of the families of the Levites.
23169	39	35	6	35	6	Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your fellow countrymen to carry out the word of the LORD given by Moses.”
23170	39	35	7	35	7	From his own flocks and herds Josiah contributed 30,000 lambs and goats plus 3,000 bulls for the Passover offerings for all the people who were present.
23171	39	35	8	35	8	His officials also contributed willingly to the people and priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of the house of God, gave the priests 2,600 Passover offerings and 300 bulls.
23172	39	35	9	35	9	Additionally, Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated to the Levites 5,000 Passover offerings and 500 bulls.
23173	39	35	10	35	10	So the service was prepared; the priests stood in their places and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command.
23174	39	35	11	35	11	And they slaughtered the Passover lambs, while the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them and the Levites skinned the animals.
23175	39	35	12	35	12	They set aside the burnt offerings to be given to the divisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses; and they did the same with the bulls.
23176	39	35	13	35	13	They roasted the Passover animals on the fire according to the regulation, and they boiled the other holy offerings in pots, kettles, and bowls and quickly brought them to all the people.
23177	39	35	14	35	14	Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering up burnt offerings and fat until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
23178	39	35	15	35	15	The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. And the gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their position, because their fellow Levites made preparations for them.
23179	39	35	16	35	16	So on that day the entire service of the LORD was carried out for celebrating the Passover and offering burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
23180	39	35	17	35	17	The Israelites who were present also observed the Passover at that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
23181	39	35	18	35	18	No such Passover had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites who were present, and the people of Jerusalem.
23182	39	35	19	35	19	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed.
23183	39	35	20	35	20	After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him.
23184	39	35	21	35	21	But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, “What is the issue between you and me, O king of Judah? I have not come against you today, but I am fighting another dynasty. God told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or He will destroy you!”
23185	39	35	22	35	22	Josiah, however, did not turn away from him; instead, in order to engage him in battle, he disguised himself. He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God, but went to fight him on the Plain of Megiddo.
23186	39	35	23	35	23	There the archers shot King Josiah, who said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded!”
23187	39	35	24	35	24	So his servants took him out of his chariot, put him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. And Josiah was buried in the tomb of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
23188	39	35	25	35	25	Then Jeremiah lamented over Josiah, and to this day all the choirs of men and women sing laments over Josiah. They established them as a statute for Israel, and indeed they are written in the Book of Laments.
23189	39	35	26	35	26	As for the rest of the acts of Josiah, along with his deeds of loving devotion according to what is written in the Law of the LORD—
23190	39	35	27	35	27	his acts from beginning to end—they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
23191	39	36	1	36	1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
23192	39	36	2	36	2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
23193	39	36	3	36	3	And the king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
23194	39	36	4	36	4	Then Neco king of Egypt made Eliakim brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakim’s brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.
23195	39	36	5	36	5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
23196	39	36	6	36	6	Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jehoiakim and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
23197	39	36	7	36	7	Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon some of the articles from the house of the LORD, and he put them in his temple in Babylon.
23198	39	36	8	36	8	As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations he committed, and all that was found against him, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.
23199	39	36	9	36	9	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
23200	39	36	10	36	10	In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar summoned Jehoiachin and brought him to Babylon, along with the articles of value from the house of the LORD. And he made Jehoiachin’s relative Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.
23201	39	36	11	36	11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
23202	39	36	12	36	12	And he did evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke for the LORD.
23203	39	36	13	36	13	He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. But Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.
23204	39	36	14	36	14	Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied their unfaithful deeds, following all the abominations of the nations, and they defiled the house of the LORD, which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.
23205	39	36	15	36	15	Again and again the LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to His people through His messengers because He had compassion on them and on His dwelling place.
23206	39	36	16	36	16	But they mocked the messengers of God, despising His words and scoffing at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD against His people was stirred up beyond remedy.
23207	39	36	17	36	17	So He brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who put their choice young men to the sword in the sanctuary, sparing neither young men nor young women, neither elderly nor infirm. God gave them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,
23208	39	36	18	36	18	who carried off everything to Babylon—all the articles of the house of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king and his officials.
23209	39	36	19	36	19	Then the Chaldeans set fire to the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the palaces and destroyed every article of value.
23210	39	36	20	36	20	Those who escaped the sword were carried by Nebuchadnezzar into exile in Babylon, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
23211	39	36	21	36	21	So the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all the days of the desolation, until seventy years were completed, in fulfillment of the word of the LORD through Jeremiah.
23212	39	36	22	36	22	In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows:
23213	39	36	23	36	23	“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you belongs to His people, may the LORD his God be with him, and may he go up.’”
